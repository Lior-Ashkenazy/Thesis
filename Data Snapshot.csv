New pool factories have been deployed on all networks.
* [Aave Rebalanced Linear Pool](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220817-aave-rebalanced-linear-pool)
* [Composable Stable Pool](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220817-composable-stable-pool)

This proposal seeks governance approval to grant specific roles to certain ecosystem participants for security purposes and efficient management of these pools.

# Authorize the Emergency subDAO to pause the pools
Just like with previous pools, these new pools have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.


Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing the [Emergency subDAO](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197) to pause the system**. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the Emergency subDAO will have any pause power.

# Authorize Balancer Maxis to manage pool parameters
As in previous versions, these pools contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions:

* Composable Stable Pools:
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
  * token rate cache duration
* Linear Pools:
  * swap fee
  * lower target
  * upper target

For a detailed description of each one of those, see the corresponding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-gauntlet-and-the-ballers-multisig-to-manage-pool-parameters/2400) for StablePhamtomPools and AaveLinearPool v1.

In light of Tribe DAO [proposing to shutter operations](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475) it no longer makes sense for Balancer to support FEI liquidity with BAL emissions. As the future of FEI is fairly uncertain now I believe the best course of action is to kill this gauge. 

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the `AuthorizerAdaptor` at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call `performAction` using `0xab8f0945` for the `data(bytes)` argument and `0x4f9463405F5bC7b4C1304222c1dF76EFbD81a407` for the `target(address)` argument.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[1210252.0818280464, 0]",1
2,0x69b044ed3253c9d2b279d80535f0beaedf8ae21d4d04be0807d5243f0e8c3771,[BIP-47] Balancer <> Across Protocol for Bridging Tokens Across Chains,"***EDIT: Risk Labs Treasury has offered to provide the loan of 10K BAL tokens for the relayer.  So the proposal is being modified to only request 40K BAL tokens to be deposited into Across BAL LP from Balancer Treasury.***

This proposal suggests that Balancer treasury use 40,000 BAL to enable fast, cheap, and secure bridging between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism via Across Protocol (website: across.to ; Twitter: @AcrossProtocol).

**Motivation:**

Balancer currently is using Multichain for this bridging. Due to the design of Multichain, BAL tokens are getting stuck in destination chains due to bridging flows, and thus not allowing users to easily go back and forth between L1<>L2 and between L2’s.

For example, right now, the state of the Multichain pools are:

Ethereum: 484;

Optimism: 41,287;

Polygon: 18,728;

Arbitrum: 20,328

**note that 20k BAL was very recently added to Polygon and Arbitrum via BIP-37, so those are still close to original balances. The BIP-3 proposal that added 20k to each of Ethereum and Optimism is now completely out of balance with only ~1% of the supply remaining on Ethereum. This means users cannot exit to Ethereum until a bridger comes along to rebalance the pools!*

This has also made some bridging routes extremely expensive or not even possible.

For example, right now, if you want to bridge 100 BAL from Optimism to Ethereum. The charge to the user is 12% (they only get 88 tokens on the other side). If BAL was on Across, the charge would be 0.12%, which is 99% lower. The user would get 99.88 BAL on Ethereum instead of the 88 BAL offered by Multichain.

Also, if you wanted to transfer more than 484 BAL, it wouldn’t be possible. With Across, you could transfer up to the entire amount sitting in the relayer in 1-4 minutes, which is likely ~7,000 BAL (I’ll explain more about the relayer under specifications). And you could transfer the *entire amount available in the liquidity pool* within 2-4 hours, which is likely ~30,000 BAL! (subject to utilizations; it could be much more if other depositors participate in the LP).

**Extra Protocol Incentive (Referral Program):**

Across recently launched a referral program where referrers and referees are rewarded in (pre-launch) $ACX tokens.

Currently the rewards rate is between 40-80% of bridge fees being rebated back to the referrer/referee. There is an additional 2X boost bonus being paid at the moment as well. Since $ACX does not exist yet (but coming soon), the amount is calculated using $0.10 price (100mm FDV).

You can read more details on Across Doc site under 'Referral Program'

Balancer could add a link to Across on their site and earn referral rewards to the Balancer Treasury for everyone that bridges using Across. Note also the bridgers will share a portion of this reward as well.

**Risk:**

All the ‘typical’ smart contract risks. You can read the Across (v2) and other UMA audits here:  https://blog.openzeppelin.com/?s=UMA.  The UMA Optimistic Oracle (OO) is used to settle any disputes if/when they occur.  The OO has been battle tested on 100’s of millions (soon to be > 1B) worth of assets. Across itself just passed $500MM in transfer volume. It has been integrated into the front-ends of Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Boba.

**Specification:**

***
Add 40K BAL tokens to Across BAL LP as per the following steps:

1.  Get HubPool address from https://docs.across.to/v2/developers/contract-addresses/mainnet-chain-id-1

2. Approve HubPool contract to spend the right amount of BAL

3. Call addLiquidity on the HubPool contract https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/master/contracts/HubPool.sol#L454

4. This will give them LP tokens back.

***

Across works using (1) relayers and (2) liquidity pools.

1. Relayers: The relayers facilitate fast bridging (1-4mins typically) by providing a short term loan to the bridger on the destination chain upon validating the bridgers deposit on the origin chain. The relayer is reimbursed by the liquidity pool (assuming the transfer is not disputed). The dispute period is 2hrs. Think of the relayer as providing ~2-4hr loans over and over.
2. Liquidity Pools: The liquidity pools are reimbursed what they pay the relayers once the bridger’s deposit on the origin chain makes its way over that chain's canonical (“official”) bridge, which typically takes 7days. Think of the liquidity pool as providing 7day loans over and over. Anyone can deposit BAL into the Across BAL LP.

It is our suggestion that Balancer treasury use 40,000 BAL to fund an Across BAL LP to set up bridging on Across.

Relayer: 10,000 BAL will be provided and used by Risk Labs (the foundation that built UMA and Across) to run a relayer.  Since the relayer is permissionless, if Balancer is comfortable running their own relayer, they are more than welcome to do this in the future. You can read about how to run a relayer here: https://docs.across.to/v2/developers/running-a-relayer

Liquidity Pool: Balancer Treasury will deposit 40,000 BAL into an Across BAL Liquidity Pool. It is able to be withdrawn at any time (assuming it is not being utilized. ‘Utilized’ means it is in the canonical bridge en route back to Ethereum, which can take up to 7days.).

**Case Study of Actual BAL pool on Multichain:**

Looking through the BAL pool on Ethereum in Multichain, it looks like it supported 34 transfers (14 withdrawals) over a period of 53 days, and is now effectively shutdown (since there is only 484 BAL available). The sizes of the 6 withdrawals over 1,000 BAL were: 12,323; 9,494; 3,740; 2,225; 1,688; 1,339. The other 8 were all < 1,000.

Given the relayer allocation I proposed above, if Balancer was using Across, all 14 withdrawals would have no trouble being completed, and most importantly *the relayer would be totally rebalanced within 2-4hrs and be ready to do more transfers*! For 12 of the 14 transfers the users would have received their BAL on Ethereum in 1-4 mins. For the 2 biggest transfers, it would have taken 2-4hrs. Since these transfers occurred over a period of 53 days, the Across LP would have been totally replenished ~7x. Said another way, with the same seed amount of 20k BAL, Across could have supported 140,000 BAL (7 x 20k) worth of transfers and restored back to original conditions vs Multichain only supported ~34k and is now effectively turned off until a bridger comes along to rebalance their pools.

The Balancer treasury currently has 80k BAL tokens in Multichain. If they switched to Across, the treasury could take back 40,000 tokens, be able to support >5x the volumes at a fraction of the cost, and always be operational.

Across also could do all of this at ~0.12% on each transaction. Right now, the Multichain fee on moving 100 BAL to Ethereum is 12% (100x more!).

![|624x288](upload://1eQeppVHQObOO2whuSXCdRX6pRY.png)

Out of fairness, the Multichain fee to move 100 BAL to Optimism from Ethereum is 0.10%. If Balancer treasury wanted Across to only be 0.10% (or lower) that is easy to do, Balancer could just specify a lower LP fee (explained in next section). It’s about striking a balance between low bridge fees for your users vs high BAL APYs to attract external LPs. Depending where Balancer treasury wants to be along that curve, we can set the LP fee model accordingly.

Fees:
Across has 3 fees in its system:

1. LP Fee: Fee paid to liquidity providers for proving passive liquidity that is utilized by the system to refund relayers. This fee is configurable via a rate model. Balancer treasury can specify what they would like it to be. Obviously, the higher the LP fee, the more the LPs make on each transaction, but the more expensive the transaction is to the user. We would suggest a 5% LP APY fee, which effectively results in the bridger paying 0.09% on each transfer. Our rate model does have an Aave style feature that at high utilizations of the LP, the 5% number will increase (in order to preserve some liquidity in the system), but this amount and slope of increase is configurable.
2. Relayer Fee: Fee paid to incentivize relayers to relay your bridge transaction quickly. This is currently 0.03% and gets paid to the relayer that fills the transfer.
3. Destination Gas Fee: Fee paid by bridger to cover the gas cost on their destination chain. Obviously going to a L2, this number will typically be quite small. Going to Ethereum, it’s subject to gas prices and can vary.

The ~0.12% total Across fee mentioned earlier is (1) + (2) = 0.09% + 0.03% = 0.12%. This number will be higher when going to Ethereum as fixed gas costs scale up quickly as a percentage of the transfer amount when the transfer amount is sufficiently small.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[511472.6924799939, 70590.26946103535]",1

**Protocol Description**

Silo is a lending market that allows users to lend and borrow any asset in a risk-isolated way through the use of a bridge asset design. Our largest liquidity pool sits in the SILO:FRAX Curve Factory pool. The pool is incentivized with ~130k protocol-owned vlCVX (half of SiloDAO ~260k holdings).

Token holders currently passed a [proposal](https://snapshot.silo.finance/#/proposal/0xa656fc504f1ceb46239f8b24a2736b33231b6e830bbb528947838248d7f785e4) to allocate ~130k vlCVX to incentivize SILO:ETH Balancer pool. The core team will use ~130k vlCVX to collect bribes, sell them, and use proceeds to bribe veBAL holders.

**Motivation**

SiloDAO originally purchased ~260k CVX with the intention of max-locking and directing $CRV and $CVX emissions to the SILO:FRAX v2 gauge. The solution has fallen short of the community’s expectation for a few reasons:

* Despite high APY (~130% at peak), we were only able to attract a modest amount of liquidity resulting in high slippage.
* The stablecoin (Frax) pairing may have discouraged LPs from depositing despite high APY.
* Curve factory pools are not mostly read by price aggregators (e.g. CoinMarketcap) or routed through by DEX aggregators (e.g. 1inch).

Activating a gauge for the SILO:ETH Balancer pool will allow SiloDAO to build a primary source of liquidity for our token by incentivizing liquidity. We believe Balancer is far more widely integrated by price and DEX aggregators which makes it a more convenient option. The ETH pairing as opposed to stablecoin exposes LPs to lower IL. Last but not least, once ignited, the Silo’s Tokemak reactor can direct liquidity to the Balancer pool once the integration between the two protocols happens.

**Specifications**

1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

Silo is operated as a DAO and governance decisions are completely decentralized. Holders can create proposals, create snapshot votes to gauge temperature, and vote on Tally for on-chain decisions.

2. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

Silo lending protocol currently uses Uniswap v3 and Balancer v2 oracles in order to read asset prices. This is required to gauge lending parameters such as LTV and Health Factors to allow liquidation of undercollateralized positions.

3. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

Our audit reports from ABDK and Quantstamp as well as a Certora Formal Verification Report can be found here <https://silopedia.silo.finance/security/audits-and-formal-verification>

4. Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

No, token holders fully control both the DAO and its lending contracts. 

5. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume?

Our Balancer pool is https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x48607651416a943bf5ac71c41be1420538e78f87000200000000000000000327. It had at most $50k TVL whilst the majority of our liquidity was on Uniswap v3 and Curve v2 although we aim to make Balancer our primary liquidity pool through incentives. $SILO is an unpegged asset and has faced similar price volatility as other assets, experiencing significant upward price action with the tail-end of the bull-market in April 2022 before crashing a significant amount with the recent downtrend.

6. Value: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)

Our Balancer SILO:ETH pool will be incentivized with an equal value of bribes as our SILO:FRAX pool on Curve v2 (both will receive ~130k vlCVX in votes or bribe-equivalents). Given our protocol had just launched to the public this week, we expect trading volume to pick up rapidly as our token gains utility.

We will reassess the value of bribes:liquidity between SILO:ETH on Balancer and SILO:FRAX on Curve v2 and will happily add more incentives to Balancer if it is shown to be cost-effective.

Note: Please ensure the owner of your pool on Ethereum is set to 0xba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1b If this is not done, please clearly explain why in your proposal.

Tracer DAO has recently rebranded to Mycelium and expanded its strategic direction as part of a recent [governance proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0x2f2103cc31a01e36f94d488ae5c3ea9a9d57b5f4543a8897fe2d74c9f8c3ec7c). Balancer has and will continue to be a significant part of the Mycelium ecosystem. With the Perpetual Pools, Balancer serves as the secondary market for pool token and we are building tools that will leverage BLP tokens to aggregate stable coin and other assets to serve as collateral in Perpetual Pool markets. 

Next week, Mycelium is releasing a Perpetual Swap product. The product is a generalised fork of GMX. If you’re familiar with the GMX model you are probably aware of their liquidity token, GLP. Mycelium will be releasing MLP which is effectively a yield bearing index of stablecoins and bluechip crypto tokens that acts as the universal counter-party for leveraged traders. MLP will introduce a number of new assets relative to GLP, one of which is BAL. BAL will be used in the MLP pool to collateralise trader’s long BAL positions, which are executed at the oracle price with no slippage. The MLP pool will also act as an AMM allowing traders to buy and sell BAL. 

The token weights in the pool are adjusted to help hedge the holders of MLP against trader open positions. For example, if a large number of traders are long BAL, the MLP pool target weighting would be adjusted to have a higher BAL holding. Initially, BAL will have a target weighting of 1% of the MLP Pool. 

Please find more information here: [Perpetual Swap and MLP background](https://tracerdao.medium.com/mycelium-perpetual-swaps-5f0cf94a456b) 

**Motivation**

The following proposal is for the Balancer community to allocate a percentage of the BAL held in the Balancer treasury towards the MLP liquidity pool. To provide [incentives to LPs](https://tracerdao.medium.com/lp-incentives-8587a4ee7fc8), Mycelium will be targeting a 25% APR to LPs for the first month after launch. 70% of fees generated by traders will be distributed to MLP holders. These fees will be paid out to MLP holders in ETH. If the APR derived from ETH rewards is under the targeted 25% APR, the shortfall will be subsidised with escrowed MYC, Mycelium’s native token, that vests over a 6 month period. 

The goal of this proposal is to diversify the Balancer treasury, deposit BAL into the MLP liquidity pool and, earn ETH and MYC rewards. As a result, the Balancer community would generate yield on liquid treasury assets. $200,000 worth of BAL would help seed liquidity into MLP to allow traders to go long BAL in an meaningful as we launch Mycelium Perpetual Swaps.

**Risks**

* Single sided asset supplied; LPs are protected against impermanent loss seen in traditional AMM models. Despite only depositing BAL, the treasury would be exposed to every asset in the MLP pool (see the chart above).

* Smart Contract risk; Mycelium Perpetual Swap contracts are unaudited, but are a direct fork of the GMX codebase, which has been audited. GMX code has facilitated 10’s of billions in volume via their codebase and has hundreds of millions locked in its contracts.

* Oracle risk; all transactions are executed at the oracle price feed. If the oracle price feed were to be manipulated in some way LPs may realise losses. To mitigate this risk, Mycelium Perpetual Swaps is using an aggregated oracle pricing system pulling in data feeds directly from Chainlink, Binance, Bitfinex and FTX. By aggregating these feeds prices are normalised, eliminating the risk of exchange specific volatility.

* Trader’s profits; LPs are providing assets for traders to go long and short. If traders are profitable, that would cause a portion of LPs capital to be lost in the form of trader’s gains. Historically, as seen with GMX, traders have suffered consistent losses against the pools.

I’m eager to get the discussion going and hear what the community thinks.

### **Introduction/Abstract**

This proposal aims to bring the Snapshot strategy in line with the original expectations for space based snapshot delegation, by simply using the raw vlAURA balance instead of the voting power, which is delegated on-chain with the vlAURA contract. 

In plain English, it proposes using only one layer of delegation rather than two.

### **Motivation**

There are several reasons to make this change:

- It is simpler to measure voting power with one delegation rather than two layers
- vlAURA holders may choose to delegate to Balancer delegates rather than Aura delegates for Balancer proposals
- Many vlAURA holders are delegating with voting marketplaces such as Hidden Hand and may wish to override their vote on Balancer proposals

### **Risks**

This is a relatively minor adjustment to the Snapshot Space as vlAURA-veBAL is already supported, and the calculation for the underlying veBAL remains the same. The new strategy has been tested thoroughly. 

### **Specification**

**Current strategy**

The current Balancer voting strategy uses three sub-strategies:

1. veBAL balance (`erc20-balance-of`)
2. A delegation strategy (`delegation`) for the `balancer.eth` space using veBAL balance (`erc20-balance-of`) and vlAURA votes mapped to the underlying veBAL balance (`aura-vlaura-vebal`)
3. vlAURA votes mapped to the underlying veBAL balance (`aura-vlaura-vebal`)

In this strategy, vlAURA holders delegate their AURA through Aura's delegation system (i.e. not the Balancer delegation space), and cannot override the vote of their delegate. Given many vlAURA holders delegate with voting marketplaces like Hidden Hand, this is sub-optimal and complicated, since it involves two layers of delegation.

**Proposed strategy**

Change the vlAURA parts of the strategy to use a new strategy (`aura-balance-of-vlaura-vebal`) that maps the vlAURA balance (not delegated votes) to the underlying veBAL balance.

In this strategy, vlAURA holders can choose to delegate their vote via the Balancer delegation space. The vlAURA vote delegation does not affect voting power. Similarly to holding and delegating veBAL in this strategy, vlAURA holders can choose to override the vote of their delegate for a given proposal.

There is currently 2,515,349.77 FEI in the treasury that originated from a [treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-treasury-swap-balancer-dao-fei-dao/2254) that occurred in October 2021.  Under the original agreement, the DAO was to use these funds for operational expenses.  The SP’s passed so far require payment in USDC, so I believe it is a good time to convert the FEI into USDC so that the DAO can use it later on to pay expenses without needing to convert the FEI every time the DAO pays out.

**Summary:**

BeethovenX has been working with the Rocket Pool team to bring rETH to Optimism. Recently the Rocket Pool team deployed the [rETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x658843BB859B7b85cEAb5cF77167e3F0a78dFE7f#readContract) we needed to ensure the price of rETH correctly updates as it earns staking revenue.

**Protocol Description:**

> Rocket Pool ETH (rETH) is a token that represents liquid staked ETH on the Beacon chain. As this staked ETH earns a yield the price of rETH increases to reflect that.

**Motivation:**

Recently Rocket Pool made a [proposal for Optimism incentives](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x219e6f3cc726c24e7eb100959abea6cc3a5c24a24ffec3072a7784d33f030096) that would see the majority allocated to our deployment on Optimism. Additionally, the rETH pool on Ethereum is one of our most profitable pools in terms of fees earned per dollar of emissions. More rETH liquidity on Balancer should have a positive impact on Balancer's revenue generation and I expect liquid staked ETH to be quite popular on L2's. This pool is our first step towards capturing this new market.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Please see this [guide](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1) which outlines Rocket Pool's DAO structure. 

2. **Oracles:** This pool will rely on a rate provider which has been deployed to Optimism [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x658843BB859B7b85cEAb5cF77167e3F0a78dFE7f#readContract). 

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd).

5. **Market History:** See [coingecko page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth).
 
6. **Value:** It is our goal to make this the highest TVL pool for rETH on Optimism. Once we have the new weighted pool factory we will create additional pools with rETH that will help increase it's usage on Optimism, thus creating more swap fee revenue in addition to the protocol fee we apply to rETH's yield.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[640064.124026522, 0]",1

THX Network requests to whitelist its Gnosis Safe multisig address to enable it to lock B-80BAL-20WETH into veBAL and participate in governance and gauge voting.

# Motivation

THX Network allows creators and communities to create and embed ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in their platforms and social channels. The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS).

$THX is the project’s governance token launched in dec. 2021 using a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) and has its main source of liquidity on Balancer’s Polygon deployment (~$900k TVL).

Our emerging DAO is about to diversify its treasury into $BAL and participate in Balancer’s governance.

**Protocol Description:**

Manifold Finance enables and provides access to high-value transaction pools on EVM compatible chains, through our infrastructure: *SecureRPC* . They aggregate multiple endpoints along with maintaining direct access to disparate mining pools/validator nodes (Flashbots, Eden, Miners).

**Motivation:**

Current onchain liquidity is sitting at only 300k while generating in the past few days over 4m$ in volume incentives & bribes to deepen liquidity at this stage of growth is key for Manifold.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 

Governance utilizes an architecture of elected dictator. By staking FOLD tokens, you delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator). The dictator offers a tribute (rewards) for your support. Accounts that are participating in the dictator regime may elect to vote for a new supreme dictator (operator/management for the protocol) by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.  
Source : https://github.com/manifoldfinance/majordomo

A known attack vector involving sandwich staking is mitigated by manually disbursing tributes. This attack vector will be mitigated by a time-dependent withdrawal period in our V2 Vault upgrade. 

> Note that this attack vector has never been actually realized, as it was caught beforehand

Protocol Fees are immediately collected in a vault which then distributes it over time (the time withdrawal is to prevent MEV attacks against the protocol in which accounts enter/exit during certain periods of time). 

A Multisig address is available. The multisig only holds tokens for the purposes of voting in governance proposals of other DAO's. This will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure in which the tokens are held in-vault, with certain permissions enabled for the operator address only. 

2. **Oracles:** 

Not Applicable. 

3. **Audits:**  

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/pki#security-bug-handling-process

https://www.manifoldfinance.com/.well-known/security.txt

Additionally they maintain the DeFi Threat Matrix which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations on decentralized finance

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/defi-threat/security/advisories?state=published



4. **Centralization vectors:** 

They utilize a concept of Permissive Action List to enable a two-step ownership process for any partner integrations. 

Centralization risks include but are not limited to:

GitHub - we perform off site backups and coordination in the event of GitHub deleting the manifoldfinance org (see LMDBX event for an example).

Google Services: We utilize a domain name not administered by Google for internal services such as user registration, etc. This is not the manifoldfinance.com email address.

Governance Discussions occur on a centralized service, Discourse. [see forums.manifoldfinance.com](https://forums.manifoldfinance.com)

There are also certain account addresses with a large amount of FOLD tokens. However we feel that due to the 'unique' governance regime that this is not in practice a risk factor as it would normally be under traditional DAO governance structures.

The previous version of Balancer's [FeeDistributor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x26743984e3357efc59f2fd6c1afdc310335a61c9) contract had a logic issue that caused 3100 BAL to be deposited and permanently locked from claiming by the Aura [VoterProxy](0xaF52695E1bB01A16D33D7194C28C42b10e0Dbec2). These tokens were already minted, deposited as rewards, and are now permanently locked.

Note: No other accounts or claims were affected. The issue was identified and subsequently rectified.

To compensate for the missed yield and ensure the system functioned as intended, the Aura Treasury [manually deposited](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4664133f60b5d7111bccfe451d94c86c8986c8d8d48ebff14aaf70148378a4e3) the missing BAL to the auraBAL rewards.

**Proposal**

It is proposed that this BAL is repaid to the treasury.

**Specification**

Transfer 3,100 BAL tokens to the [Aura Treasury Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfc78f8e1Af80A3bF5A1783BB59eD2d1b10f78cA9)","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[1487839.2765402475, 3253.188600659811]",1

**This would not cost the DAO any additional BAL.**

The Orb team is requesting 398,527 BAL, to be awarded as compensation to current and future team members on a 4 year vesting basis, with a 1 year cliff.

These BAL tokens would come from the DAO, which has recently increased its BAL supply via a [transfer](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa4fcebdade3b601cdba9e308772a5eff1e0281453b5dd831864ce261bb19de5d) it received on 29/07/22.

As you may recall [BIP-3](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-3-allocate-bal-towards-etherem-optimism-bridge-liquidity/3259) allocated 40k BAL towards Ethereum<>Optimism bridge liquidity on [Multichain](https://app.multichain.org/). Since then this liquidity has seen fairly [good usage](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x99C409E5f62E4bd2AC142f17caFb6810B8F0BAAE#tokentxns). I reached out to Multichain to add Polygon & Arbitrum support to their router which is now operational - it just needs to be seeded with BAL liquidity so users can start bridging. 

I think it's valuable to be able to easily transfer BAL between all of Balancer's deployments, plus this puts to work idle BAL in the Treasury as we do earn bridging fees on all of this activity. As BIP-19 begins to drive more adoption for us on Polygon & Arbitrum it is reasonable to expect an increased demand in bridging BAL between networks. 

### Specification
If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will send 40,000 BAL to the liquidity mining multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`.

Balancer currently has 50+ active gauges. The vast majority of these were grandfathered in when veBAL launched and many have never gotten votes. I propose to remove all gauges that meet both criteria below:

* Gets less than 0.1% of the vote
* 80/20 pool that is not the primary source of liquidity

Plus removing all gauges with exactly 0% of the vote unless recently approved in a gauge vote. These gauges are not likely to ever drive value to the protocol so there’s no reason to have them on the voting list. If desired, anyone can pursue a proposal to re-activate a gauge from this list in the future.

This proposal is to add a veBAL gauge for the new TEMPLE-DAI 80/20 weighted pool on Ethereum.

**## References/Useful links:**

*Website: templedao.link*

*Github Page: github.com/TempleDAO/TempleDAO*

*Communities: discord.gg/templedao*


**## Protocol Description:**

TempleDAO is a low-volatility yielding token with over $52M in TVL. TempleDAO was an early backer of Frax Finance by conducting its presale exclusively in FRAX, and became a top holder with one of the largest FRAX reserves ($137M). We are one of the largest non-AMO providers of FRAX liquidity on Curve. Since March, TempleDAO has spent over $800K at Pitch.money on veFXS holder bribes to evangelize the Frax ecosystem. We hope to continue to add value for the benefit of both Temple and Balancer as we diversify into Balancer technology and our liquidity. Our inaugural Balancer pool is a weighted LP pool TEMPLE/DAI 80/20 chosen for its high farming efficiency and low risk of impermanent loss.

**## Motivation:**

This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the TEMPLE/DAI 80/20 weighted pool. Platform BAL incentives would help deepen TEMPLE liquidity as weekly trading transaction volume on the Temple custom Uni v2 AMM has ranged between $4M to $5M for the past 30 days. The TEMPLE-FRAX gauge on Frax Finance currently has over $37M in total value locked (TVL) and we have provided close to $1mm USD value in FRAX and FXS in bribe incentives to drive liquidity into our FRAX gauge. If approved, we expect to do the same for our veBAL gauge and are in coordination with Hidden Hand to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative. 

A Balancer LP would bring sizable TEMPLE trading volume to the Balancer platform and we plan to add more liquidity over time to maintain our share of the Balancer gauge rewards. We also plan to be active participants in Balancer governance as not only are we big fans of the technology, but also share a common vision of reducing price volatility, deep liquidity, and customizable asset exposure.

**## Specifications:**

**Governance:**

TempleDAO current team has been almost completely sourced from the community contributors. We started with a top-down nomination system for promotion and are currently in the early stages of implementing a Discord-integrated election system for promoting and demoting team members which will eventually lead to more decentralization.

**Oracles:**

TempleDAO does not rely on any external oracles. The intrinsic value per token used for price floor defense is coded into the contract: 0x22c2fE05f55F81Bf32310acD9a7C51c4d7b4e443. Our custom Uni v2 AMM has handled close to $300M in transaction volume since launch without any issues.

**Audits:**

TempleDAO contracts have been fully audited by Peckshield. We also have a generous and on-going bug bounty system at hats.finance funded with over $300K USD in $TEMPLE rewards.

**Centralization vectors:**

* The token is not upgradeable nor pausable;
* The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract;
* The team behind the token have shown that they have never abused nor committed any actions that would affect the integrity of the builders behind TempleDAO.

**Market History:**

TEMPLE initiated its token presale in October of 2021 and public trading began on its own custom AMM on December 19, 2021. The $TEMPLE token price has exhibited extreme price stability for the past 5 months staying within a very narrow range above its intrinsic value price even with significant transaction volume. TempleDAO plans to use the veBAL/vlAURA voting system to boost BAL rewards for its TEMPLE LP along with TEMPLE subsidiary STAX Finance which will further drive more TVL into our LP through $STAX incentives. 

**## CONCLUSION**

The TempleDAO Team aims to be a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions utilizing Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand (“HH”) platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the 80/20 TEMPLE/DAI pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.

Laguna Games requests the whitelisting of the Laguna Games Gnosis Safe, enabling it to lock veBAL and participate in governance and gauge voting activities.

## Motivation
Laguna Games is a game development company responsible for building the [Crypto Unicorns](https://www.cryptounicorns.fun/) game. Crypto Unicorns’ RBW is the primary token value used both for in-game operations, in-game marketplace and governance. Laguna Games recognizes Balancer as a long-term partner, with our [official RBW/wETH liquidity pool](https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x8f9dd2064eb38e8e40f2ab67bde27c0e16ea9b080002000000000000000004ca) resting on Balancer. We hope that with this, we’d be able to further align with the Balancer ecosystem through active participation in governance and by incentivizing additional liquidity flow via Balancer.

## Specification
We are requesting to whitelist the Laguna Games Gnosis Safe multisig so it may interact with the veBAL contract.

## **Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Crypto Unicorns is an interactive entertainment DAO created by Laguna Games that explores the principles of progressive decentralization. Key decisions are voted upon by sRBW (staked RBW) holders via Snapshot. As a soft governance based on votes recorded on Snapshot, implementation of approved proposals falls under Laguna Games during its early stages. We are in the process of building a fully-independent DAO with its own bylaws operated at the direction of the sRBW holders with the mission of supporting the advancement of the Crypto Unicorns community.

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/lgcryptounicorns.eth)    

2. **Oracles:** We do not use any other external oracles that affect the price of RBW. Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is employed as a tamper-proof and auditable source of randomness needed to randomly choose rewards for players of Crypto Unicorns for the Dark Forest mini-game and to randomly determine the stats and parts of Unicorns when initiating in-game actions such as breeding and evolution. This, however, does not affect the price of RBW. 

3. **Audits:** We take security very seriously and engage in best practices across the board.

For a refresher on what the Batch Relayer is you can review the proposal to [approve the Batch Relayer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-authorize-the-batch-relayer/2378) and to [approve the Batch Relayer v2](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-polygon-authorize-batch-relayer-v2-for-usd-boosted-pool/2655). The functionality added in v3 is primarily to aid in the coming migration of stabal3 and bb-a-USD to the soon to be deployed new version of bb-a-USD. This new bb-a-USD addresses the vulnerabilities previously disclosed [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-disclosure/3179) and also includes new features like [recovery mode](https://medium.com/@0xSkly/inside-balancer-code-recoverymode-9af34ce5ab72) and the ability to apply Balancer’s protocol fee to the Aave yield.

Additionally, the new Batch Relayer will have the ability to stake & unstake in the gauges on behalf of the user. This will allow the above mentioned migration to be completed in a single transaction (after the user has approved the Batch Relayer). It can also claim incentives from gauges on behalf of the user, opening the possibility for single-transaction claim-invest-stake flows.

Balancer currently has 50+ active gauges. The vast majority of these were grandfathered in when veBAL launched and many have never gotten votes. I propose to remove all gauges that meet both criteria below:

* Gets less than 0.1% of the vote
* 80/20 pool that is not the primary source of liquidity

Plus removing all gauges with exactly 0% of the vote unless recently approved in a gauge vote. These gauges are not likely to ever drive value to the protocol so there’s no reason to have them on the voting list. If desired, anyone can pursue a proposal to re-activate a gauge from this list in the future.

The [GaugeAdder](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEd5ba579bB5D516263ff6E1C10fcAc1040075Fe2) is a piece of veBAL infrastructure that securely streamlines the process of adding new gauges to the system. It includes checks that ensure only gauges deployed from the official gauge factories can be added to the veBAL system and become eligible for BAL emissions. As we prepare to add gauges from new networks the `GaugeAdder` must be upgraded to support this expansion. To facilitate this upgrade a coordinator contract has been deployed by the smart contracts team at Balancer Labs. The coordinator does the following:

* Grant permission to the Balancer Labs Ops Multisig (the one that triggers the weekly BAL minting and bridging every Thursday) to control the parameters of the Arbitrum and Optimism bridge, which are required to operate them (e.g. their gas limit)
* It creates a new gauge type called ‘Optimism’ on the `GaugeController`
* It revokes permission to add gauges from the old `GaugeAdder`
* It grants permission to add gauges to the `GaugeAdder v2` and grants permission to the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` (controlled by Balancer Maxis) to add governance approved Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism gauges.
* It ports the old Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum gauge factories from the old `GaugeAdder` to the new one and adds the new Optimism gauge factory

The `GaugeAdder v2` also has support for zksync and gnosis gauges but those types are not yet created nor do gauge factories exist.

Since the [approval of the CREAM/WETH gauge](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xa8ef52b06d2e5742e9068582276e878441c29a924e8bb2a9c26686d5284a9106) back on May 24th Balancer has earned ~$12k in protocol fees while[ spending ~$1.55M worth of BAL emissions](https://dune.com/tianqi/Balancer-Gauge-Weight). The CREAM gauge is the largest recipient of BAL emissions while returning virtually zero fee revenue to the protocol. Long term mechanisms like the recently passed [“core pools” proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc) should help naturally correct this imbalance as market forces are given time to work though even in an optimistic scenario the CREAM gauge will remain very large for the foreseeable future.

Per [recent discussion](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/discussion-kill-cream-weth-gauge/3396) on the forum the community is split on this issue. Governance did approve the CREAM gauge in a legitimate vote and BAL was bought on the open market and locked in veBAL to vote for it. Governance also has the power to vote to kill any gauge for any reason and everyone participating in veBAL accepts these are the rules.

The Balancer ecosystem has significant funding requirements that currently far exceed our revenue generation based on the last 30 days. At this point in time the largest blocker to Balancer reaching sustainability is the existence of the CREAM gauge. There is enough support in the community for killing the gauge that it is appropriate to move this to a vote in my view - this proposal will be sent to the Governance Council for approval next Thursday, July 14th.

### Specification

**Summary:**

BadgerDAO Proposal to add a gauge for the [DIGG/wBTC/graviAURA Pool ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x8eb6c82c3081bbbd45dcac5afa631aac53478b7c000100000000000000000270)

• Github Page: [Github](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/)
• Twitter: https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO
• Discord: Discord

**Protocol Description:**

**BADGER Protocol**

BadgerDAO is a well established DAO which seeks to build the infrastructure for Bitcoin in DeFi. We make it easy to bridge your Bitcoin into other blockchains and start earning yield right away. Badger Vaults currently have over $80m in TVL as well as launched ibBTC which is the number 5 Bitcoin synthetic in defi. DIGG is a token integral in BadgerDAO's user yield boost mechanics which allows for users to optimize their vault yields through improved capital efficiency. DIGG is paired with wBTC which is the largest Bitcoin synthetic and has well established security.

**Price History $DIGG**

Price History for DIGG can be found on [coingecko ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digg)

**Motivation:**

The [DIGG/wBTC/graviAURA 40/40/20 Pool ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x8eb6c82c3081bbbd45dcac5afa631aac53478b7c000100000000000000000270) needs incentivization to migrate meaningful amounts of liquidity over to the Balancer ecosystem. Digg enthusiasts in the Badger DAO community are interested in making Balancer DIGGs primary exchange, source of liquidity and giving Badger supporters many opportunities to earn fees and yield on their tokens.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:**

BadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts that handle operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail in the repo linked below:
[Badger Multisigs ](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/)

The highest risk operations are controlled by a timelock address which needs to be triggered and has a 2 day time delay to perform any actions.

2. **Oracles:**

Badger does not rely on any external oracles

3. **Audits:**

Audits have been performed by multiple top tier audit agencies. Web2 has been fully audited and reviewed by Halborn and we have an ongoing relationship with Quantstamp and code4rena. Badger Audits can be found on [badger.com](http://badger.com/) here: [Security & Audits](https://badger.com/security-and-audits)

4. **Centralization vectors:**

Badger does utilize upgradeable contracts for many of the products we offer, though these are protected by a 2 day timelock for prevention of issues. Our API and frontend are hosted by centralized entities but the DAO is releasing an IPFS hosted access point for people to utilize that is fully permissionless.

5. **Market History:**

DIGG has been actively trading since January 2021. DIGG's year to date average daily trading volume is approximately $65.5k USD (almost $990k average daily since inception) primarily on sushi. The Balancer pool has only recently been launched and has not received volume to give any insights. The expectation is once Badger DAO and/or its Digg community users migrate existing liquidity the pool can bring consistent volume and fees to Balancer as DIGG's new primary source of liquidity.

**Summary:**
> Proposal to add gauge support for the newly created MAGIC/USDC 50/50 pool on L2 Arbitrum. Please note that this proposal is coming from a partner project of Treasure, LifeDAO.

**References/Useful links:**

    • Other useful links?: >>.life.treasure.lol

**Protocol Description:**

> Describe the proposed asset(s), the corresponding protocol(s), and historic prices of the token (price must come from the source of highest liquidity).
Magic is the underlying token of the Treasure web3 gaming ecosystem on L2 Arbitrum. Without spending too much time deep diving the game itself, there is a growing community with Treasure related projects driving the majority of L2 volumes. While they have always dominated NFT marketplace volumes, their recent launch of Trove marketplace has cemented this.

**Motivation:**

> MAGIC/ETH has historically been the primary (only) major source of liquidity in the ecosystem, and we would like to enable MAGIC/USDC liquidity as an alternative. The liquidity has so far also been dominated by Sushi, and this would open up liquidity and trading opportunities to expand on Balancer. This will likely not be our only pool proposal, and we hope to expand with more pools in the near future.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

LifeDAO Governance: >>.snapshot.org/#/0xlifedao.eth

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.
As this is a web3 gaming project, there are no specific audits for the liquidity pool aspect of what is being done. There are audits being completed for various aspects related to staking in the game, as well as for partner projects, but they are not specific to liquidity pools.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.
No centralized vectors, the team prioritizes security and risk of dependencies in their work and of their partners.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**
 
The pool was just created on balancer, but we expect to seed the pool with 5 figures and drive the LifeDAO community's use of this pool as a default for trading upon approval. As noted, I believe this will open up more opportunities to bring Treasure related trading into the Balancer ecosystem, and would like to use this as our first chance at that. >>.arbitrum.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xb3028ca124b80cfe6e9ca57b70ef2f0ccc41ebd40002000000000000000000ba

**Protocol Description:**

See here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708

Centered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.

**Motivation:**

The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the auraBAL/(8020 BAL/ETH BPT) pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for auraBAL in the years to come.

10% of Aura's total AURA supply is being directed to the Chef contract (0x1ab80F7Fb46B25b7e0B2cfAC23Fc88AC37aaf4e9) over 4-5 years. This flow can be diverted to provide additional rewards on top of the existing BAL & AURA that will be received as part of the natural Gauge deposits. It will also give Aura the opportunity to use this allocation to bribe voters and fuel the secondary market developing around veBAL voting.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

Previously, the [proposal for an 80/20 AURA/ETH gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-10-enable-aura-eth-80-20-gauge/3318) was rejected. This 50/50 pool is more in line with Balancers longer term ecosystem plans and will generate much deeper liquidity and trading fees for veBAL. I propose for this new pool to be whitelisted instead.

You may not have noticed but we are in the midst of a significant bear market for the price of BAL. This fact combined with the desire to expand the number of contributors in the Balancer ecosystem has led the Treasury subDAO to explore ways to bolster the DAO’s stablecoin reserves. One possibility is through the use of a Ribbon Finance treasury vault for BAL.

The DAO would deposit BAL into this vault and sell monthly calls - two quotes provided by Ribbon are as follows:

* Using a strike 25% out of the money, we can expect 3.17% yield per month -> 38% APY
* Using a strike 50% out of the money, we can expect 0.91% yield per month -> 10.92% APY

Ribbon vaults operate using [cash settled](https://optionalpha.com/lessons/physical-vs-cash-settlement-options#:~:text=Physically%20settled%20options%20are%20contracts,at%20the%20time%20of%20expiration.) options rather than physical settlement. This means in the event of the option expiring in the money the vault would transfer the cash value of the option (denominated in BAL) to the market maker. Effectively if the price of BAL goes up significantly during the month we will incur a loss then continue as normal and sell the next month’s call option. In comparison, physical settlement would mean we are obligated to sell all of our BAL at the strike price (minus slippage) if the option expires in the money.

Ribbon has signaled they are prepared to support cash or physical settlement - in both cases any BAL transferred to market makers in the event of a call option expiring in the money would be market sold. This is why slippage is taken into account when the market makers will quote us the price for the physical settlement option.

The exact amount of BAL to use for this is up for discussion. 500k BAL has been discussed but we could go as low as 250k BAL. The collected premium would be in USDC and would be available to withdraw from our vault every month.

Assuming we deposit 500k BAL, that represents around 12% of the BAL in the treasury valued at ~$4M ($8 BAL). A 38% APY would lead to a gain of ~$1.5M and 10.92% APY to a gain of ~$436k.

# Risks

* The Ribbon Vault is exploited and we lose our entire deposit
  * [Nexus Mutual offers insurance](https://app.nexusmutual.io/cover/buy/get-quote?address=0x25751853Eab4D0eB3652B5eB6ecB102A2789644B) on Ribbon Vaults which does cover their treasury products. This is an option the community can consider. For reference, the cost is 50.79 ETH for 1955 ETH worth of coverage for one year. 
* The price of BAL rises significantly during the month
  * We will incur a loss if we use cash settled options. Assuming we sell calls 25% out of the money: +50% at expiration -> ~9.7% loss. +100%, ~32% loss.

# Specification

If this vote passes, the DAO will allocate 200k BAL to sell monthly calls 25% out of the money with cash settlement. The DAO Multisig would transfer 200k BAL to the Ribbon Vault. The address of that vault would be independently confirmed via at least two sources.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[275880.8198299119, 191143.4952984348]",1

Here is the multisig ticket around seeding initial liquidity in these pools:<https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/issues/580>

 ### Governance Process Request:
As this is the first gauge vote that AURA voters can vote on.  BadgerDAO requests that the snapshot for these gauges be extended to last 5 to 7 days in length in order to give the parties involved time to educate their user-bases about how to engage in this governance.

Governance Snapshot:<https://snapshot.org/#/badgerdao.eth>

### Protocol Description:

[BadgerDAO](https://www.badger.com) is launching a new set of products focused on ve ecosystems under a new Product Division called [Gravity](https://www.badger.com/gravity). The first Gravity product is[graviAURA](https://www.badger.com/graviaura).

![](upload://6DVS6GLh2AaOhbGY2c9kjBxm7Yq.jpeg)

graviAURA is a wrapped vlAURA token with bribe harvesting features similar to[bveCVX](https://www.badger.com/products/bvecvx), Badger’s liquid vlCVX token, which has been live and managing upwards of 2m CVX/vlCVX for the past 9 months. bveCVX is a well established DeFi product, with a 9 month history of successfully managing locking, unlocking, liquidity and orderly withdrawals. The new graviAURA product is a fork of bveCVX, extended with new balancer specific features designed to allow DAOs and other token based projects and communities to create and sustain liquidity. This feature can be described in one sentence as follows:

__The vote weight from graviAURA tokens in a Balancer pool with a gauge is used to vote for the pool the tokens are in.__

This solves the free rider problem. By including graviAURA in a pool, all depositors in said pool are voting for it equally. You cannot siphon yield from the pool by depositing and not voting. graviAURA automates locking of tokens, locking on a weekly cadence. Deposited tokens, as well as any unlocked tokens from a given week, can be withdrawn until the next lock. Additionally, gauges will provide limited liquidity when there is no AURA available for withdrawal.


### Motivation:

graviAURA is designed to help DAO’s create liquidity. Part of the bootstrapping plan for graviAURA involves supporting an ecosystem pool for at least the first 3 months. We would like to launch the ecosystem pools, as well as a BADGER pool, as our first graviAURA gauges.

We expect each of these pools to maintain a base natural yield even without external voting, due to the fixed weight of graviAURA(and hence underlying vlAURA) in each of the pools that will consistently vote for them. Note that some external driver will be required to bootstrap pools with initial self-voting capital or incentivize an increase in the size of the pool.

  


As soon as these gauges are up, BADGER will make the following changes to our voting and farming strategies around balancer:

- All free votes controlled by the BadgerDAO Treasury will initially be split between these 3 pools.
- All POL farming BAL will be moved from the BADGER/WBTC pool to the BADGER/graviAURA pool. (assuming all 3 gauges pass)
- Any fucoolture bribes will be directed only to graviAURA pools, and if possible offered on an Aura focused bribe market.



### Specifications:

**Governance:**  
BadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts that handle operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail in the repo linked here:[Badger Multisigs.](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/)The highest risk operations are controlled by a timelock address which needs to be triggered and has a 2 day time delay to perform any actions.

The Badger Multisig maintains governance over the contract, and can redelegate the votes to a new EOA should the wallet be compromised. The potential risk of this centralized element of the system is therefore the misdirection of all graviAURA votes for 1 voting round.

**Oracles:**

Badger does not rely on any external oracles

**Audits and review:**

Vaults 1.5 Quantstap audit:<https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-vaults-1.5/blob/main/security/audits/Badger%20Vaults%201.5%20-%20Quantstamp%20-%20Jan%202022.pdf>

C4 contest for graviAURA strategy:<https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-06-badger-vested-aura-contest> \[public results pending cool off period]

C4 contest results for bveCVX strategy (upstream repo of graviAURA):<https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-09-bvecvx/>

Additional audit results can be found on badger.com under[Security & Audits](https://badger.com/security-and-audits).

**Centralization vectors:**

Badger utilizes upgradeable contracts for many of the products we offer. Badger upgradeable contracts are protected by a 2 day timelock.. Our API and frontend are hosted by centralized entities, but we are developing a fully permissionless IPFS hosted access point primarily intended for strategy development.



**Note:**Due to the snapshot voting element of AURA and the requirement to automatically calculate and regularly re-vote during rounds, voting is currently controlled by an EOA. This EOA sits in a secure keystore that is only accessible to 2 senior members of the Badger team and the bot which runs the voting script. Badger will work with Aura over time to decentralize snapshot voting as much as possible, and has an active workstream focused on removing centralization risks around automated snapshot based voting.



### Market History:

AURA, graviAURA and auraBAL are all new tokens focused on the balancer ecosystem and currently do not have significant liquidity or trading history. The purpose of these gauges is to help build that. Eth is a well known token with proven market history that is easy to find.

**Badger:** Is the governance token of BadgerDAO. It has currently been trading in an 80/20 BADGER/WBTC balancer pool that can be found here: [BADGER/wBTC 80/20 Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xb460daa847c45f1c4a41cb05bfb3b51c92e41b36000200000000000000000194). The treasury maintains additional Protocol owned liquidity on both Curve and Uniswap V3, and BADGER is well traded across a number of centralized exchanges, including FTX, Binance and Coinbase.

graviAURA is designed to help DAO’s create liquidity. Part of the bootstrapping plan for graviAURA involves supporting an ecosystem pool for at least the first 3 months. We would like to launch the ecosystem pools, as well as a BADGER pool, as our first graviAURA gauges.

We expect each of these pools to maintain a base natural yield even without external voting, due to the fixed weight of graviAURA(and hence underlying vlAURA) in each of the pools that will consistently vote for them. Note that some external driver will be required to bootstrap pools with initial self-voting capital or incentivize an increase in the size of the pool.

  


As soon as these gauges are up, BADGER will make the following changes to our voting and farming strategies around balancer:

- All free votes controlled by the BadgerDAO Treasury will initially be split between these 3 pools.
- All POL farming BAL will be moved from the BADGER/WBTC pool to the BADGER/graviAURA pool. (assuming all 3 gauges pass)
- Any fucoolture bribes will be directed only to graviAURA pools, and if possible offered on an Aura focused bribe market.



### Specifications:

**Governance:**  
BadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts that handle operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail in the repo linked here:[Badger Multisigs.](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/)The highest risk operations are controlled by a timelock address which needs to be triggered and has a 2 day time delay to perform any actions.

The Badger Multisig maintains governance over the contract, and can redelegate the votes to a new EOA should the wallet be compromised. The potential risk of this centralized element of the system is therefore the misdirection of all graviAURA votes for 1 voting round.

**Oracles:**

Badger does not rely on any external oracles

**Audits and review:**

Vaults 1.5 Quantstap audit:<https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-vaults-1.5/blob/main/security/audits/Badger%20Vaults%201.5%20-%20Quantstamp%20-%20Jan%202022.pdf>

C4 contest results for bveCVX strategy (upstream repo of graviAURA):<https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-09-bvecvx/>

Additional audit results can be found on badger.com under[Security & Audits](https://badger.com/security-and-audits).

**Centralization vectors:**

Badger utilizes upgradeable contracts for many of the products we offer. Badger upgradeable contracts are protected by a 2 day timelock.. Our API and frontend are hosted by centralized entities, but we are developing a fully permissionless IPFS hosted access point primarily intended for strategy development.



**Note:**Due to the snapshot voting element of AURA and the requirement to automatically calculate and regularly re-vote during rounds, voting is currently controlled by an EOA. This EOA sits in a secure keystore that is only accessible to 2 senior members of the Badger team and the bot which runs the voting script. Badger will work with Aura over time to decentralize snapshot voting as much as possible, and has an active workstream focused on removing centralization risks around automated snapshot based voting.



### Market History:

AURA, graviAURA and auraBAL are all new tokens focused on the balancer ecosystem and currently do not have significant liquidity or trading history. The purpose of these gauges is to help build that. Eth is a well known token with proven market history that is easy to find.

**Badger:** Is the governance token of BadgerDAO. It has currently been trading in an 80/20 BADGER/WBTC balancer pool that can be found here: [BADGER/wBTC 80/20 Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xb460daa847c45f1c4a41cb05bfb3b51c92e41b36000200000000000000000194). The treasury maintains additional Protocol owned liquidity on both Curve and Uniswap V3, and BADGER is well traded across a number of centralized exchanges, including FTX, Binance and Coinbase.

The release of veBAL nearly three months ago represented a huge step forward for the Balancer ecosystem. However, the recent activity where a large percentage of BAL emissions have been directed to first the Badger then later the Cream pool has exposed a critical incentive misalignment in my view. Balancer’s most important metric is protocol revenue and there is no direct incentive for voters to prioritize pools that generate significant revenue. If such an incentive existed and large voters ignored it in favor of their special interest pool, external players would be financially motivated to lock veBAL and take advantage of that incentive.

I propose the creation of a “core” designation that governance would assign as part of the gauge vote approval. **To be eligible, a pool must contain yield bearing tokens that Balancer earns a fee on.** On Ethereum, core pools would see any fees they generate used as bribes for them in the next cycle. On Polygon & Arbitrum, all fees earned would be used as bribes for the core pools on each network, proportionally by TVL. This is intended to accelerate adoption of L2’s in the Balancer Ecosystem. Optimism is excluded as we have offloaded this responsibility to BeethovenX as part of the deal with them. Longer term if this initiative proves successful this process would be automated and L2 pools would be bribed based on fees generated rather than TVL. I’ve chosen to use TVL temporarily as calculating fees from yield and swaps is non-trivial and adds a significant amount of overhead - TVL is a close enough approximation as it is expected that most fees will be from yield.

Currently metastable pools are the only kind where Balancer earns the protocol fee on any yield generated by the underlying assets. This functionality is expected to extend to all of Balancer’s pool types later this year and these future pools could be added to the gauge vote as core pools. Some key L2 pools have been included despite the fact they do not contain yield bearing tokens - this is to begin rebuilding our L2 TVL in anticipation of the Balancer team converting these pools to yield bearing in the near future. Thus, the starting list of core pools would be:

* wstETH/weth (Ethereum, metastable)
* rETH/weth (Ethereum, metastable)
* stMATIC/wMATIC (Polygon, metastable)
* MaticX/wMATIC (Polygon, metastable)
* USDC/wETH/wMATIC/BAL (Polygon)
* wETH/USDC/wBTC (Polygon)
* wETH/USDC/wBTC (Arbitrum)

*Note that fees earned being used as bribes is after the DAO takes their 25% cut. If we collect 40 wstETH in fees, the DAO would get 10 and 30 would be used to bribe for the wstETH pool for example.*

*All bribes would be paid in USDC*

A final component to this initiative is allocating the bribes across all major players in the veBAL ecosystem. Since Hidden Hand is the predominant marketplace they will be the sole platform we use to bribe. Competing platforms are encouraged to make a governance proposal to be included in this initiative. Due to time and gas cost considerations I propose that only systems controlling more than 20% of veBAL be eligible for core pool bribes. Currently only Aura falls into that category. Bribes would be allocated according to the percentage of veBAL controlled. 

*Example: veBAL's share of fees from the wstETH/WETH pool is 30 wstETH. Aura holds 20% of veBAL according to [Dune](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL). Thus, 6 wstETH (in USDC) is allocated as a bribe for the wstETH/WETH pool on the Aura marketplace and 24 wstETH (in USDC) is allocated as a bribe on the Balancer marketplace.* 

### Conclusion

It is no secret that over time swap fee revenue will continue to decline. Balancer has the opportunity to lean into a second revenue stream - taking a portion of the yield on yield bearing tokens - that I believe will eventually represent the bulk of Balancer’s earnings. As the capability to earn protocol revenue on yield bearing tokens is extended to other pool types we must ensure voters have a financial incentive to direct emissions to these new pools. Boosted pools are an amazing mechanism to allow nearly any token with an associated lending market to become yield bearing - this is how we turn every pool into a core pool.

Bribing by external projects will still be effective though they will now be competing against core pools which was not a factor previously. However, if projects choose to take advantage of boosted pools and join this core pool program they would earn bribes for “free” which can be a powerful reason to bring your liquidity to Balancer. Projects who lock veBAL to vote for their non-core pool will see less earnings from protocol fees. However, I would argue that over the long term core pools can drive a lot of value to the protocol which would offset the short term “losses”.

### Risks

* We create a dependency on Hidden Hand for this system to function. A substantial portion of Balancer’s protocol revenue could flow through them as a result of this initiative. They have agreed to give us a special exemption for bribes made using protocol fees - we’d only be charged a 1% fee rather than the standard 4%.
* This adds complexity to the manual collection of fees as we also now have to seed bribes.
* This introduces a barrier to entry for projects intending to bribe veBAL as they are now competing against the protocol itself.
* The use of non-native veBAL marketplaces (like Aura's) could further erode any incentive to lock veBAL directly compared to using Aura or a similar system.

### Specification

If approved, the following will be in effect:

* Whenever a gauge vote occurs there is the option for the proposer to request a “core” designation (must have at least 50% yield bearing tokens that Balancer earns the protocol fee on). This would cause fees earned by that pool to be used to bribe for veBAL votes on that pool.
* The pools listed above will become core pools
* All fees earned on Polygon & Arbitrum would be used as bribes for core pools on those networks, weighted proportionally by TVL of those core pools - after the DAO takes its 25%.
* All fees earned by Ethereum core pools would be used as bribes on those pools (each pool gets its own fees as a bribe), after the DAO takes its 25%.
* All fees earned by Ethereum non-core pools continue to be sent to veBAL and the DAO (75/25 split) as they are today.
* Protocol fee collection, distribution, and any subsequent bribing would now take place every two weeks on Monday instead of weekly on Wednesday. veBAL would still only be able to claim protocol fees on the UI at the end of each epoch every Thursday.
* Bribes would be allocated proportionally to any system that controls at least 20% of the total veBAL supply","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[2090154.0913714156, 954.9463761075216]",1

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36)]. As part of the proposal 21,250 BAL and $127,500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation. With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries (See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated [[2](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Compensation-cb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d)] ). The proposal is to:

* ops subDAO Multisig [[3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325#tokentxns)] swaps its remaining USDC (expected to be 76892 USDC) after USDC Balaries for June with the treasury for the additional BAL required to pay out June Balaries in BAL (expected to be 22805 BAL ). This amount of BAL was calculated based on a BAL price of $3,66 on June 18th. After June has commenced the remaining BAL in the ops subDAO multisig will be sent back to treasury.

## Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions. Therefore a swap of BAL (from the DAO treasury) <> USDC (from the ops subDAO Multisig ) with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAO’s balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted $veBAL.

## Risks (if applicable)

* While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary, the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly health-check.
* BAL price falls below 3,66 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional $BAL due to the decreased price of $BAL.

## Specification

* ops subDAO ( 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325 ) sends 76892 USDC to Balancer DAO treasury.
* Balancer DAO treasury ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) sends 22805 BAL to the ops subDAO multisig.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[315886.1341391704, 0]",1

Recently a[ proposal was passed](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xbd025f8f5a0b1d748a8ad034f5a2b6fd50cc8ff7257cbee6b8344b2a70e9e2ed) to add various candidates to our replacement signers list for the DAO Multisig. These replacements have been completed on Ethereum and remain ongoing on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Fantom. You can see the most up to date list of signers [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/multisig). In order to ensure the activities of the DAO Multisig can continue uninterrupted we should replenish our list of available replacements. Thus, I propose adding the following people to the approved list of replacements:

* Lewis, Stablecoin Labs / Gyroscope (0xbcf751dBfe314Ee96A660EFA2Fcb259CBc364c29)
* Mounir, Paraswap (0x0951ff0835302929d6c0162b3d2495a85e38ec3a)
* Anna, Cowswap (0x04ce1ccF81AE660e23ca0c0823911df709B0E7Fc)
* Kaito, Utopia Labs (0x01eacADF51FF60916157E32A58F640fe854e530F)
* Mr. Kind, BeethovenX (0xD876847533828bE6770D1dEdB6F8f5E91fed824e)
* Hubert, StakeDAO (0x28827186555d99d9eF9E1fdB97F65C93BA554F86)

As a reminder, the DAO Multisig can tap a replacement from the approved replacements list at their discretion whenever the need arises. Currently the only approved replacement candidate is:

* Evgeny Yurtaev, CEO at Zerion (0xcec0d1a31129af0b1088a3d8dfa6abb4bd1ecb45)

### Specification

If approved, the above listed candidates will be added to the approved replacement signer list and utilized if/when needed. Kain has signaled his desire to leave the DAO Multisig due to being too busy with his other activities and he will be replaced with Mounir from Paraswap immediately. Future changes will be announced via Balancer’s discord announcements channel and twitter.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[289820.0336175606, 0]",1

FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yet-to-be-deployed stableswap pools.

- **FIAT-USDC-DAI**
- **FIAT-FEI-FRAX**

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token $FDT’s liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month.

**References/Useful links:**

- **[Dune](https://dune.com/1ab/FIAT)**
- **[Github](https://github.com/fiatdao)**
- **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao)**

**Protocol Description:**
The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature. You can learn more about its primary use case via [this thread](https://twitter.com/wjvill/status/1527680960866705408) from Element founder Will Villanueva.

**The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity.** In its current iteration, it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset, drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing. Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time, lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter - this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs. Currently, only stablecoin-denominated collateral is supported by the protocol, so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields.

**Motivation:**
Over the course of its first month in existence, $FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget. Over the same time, liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer. We’ve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with $FIAT here in its early days.

A number of items excite us about the opportunity:

- The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEI-FRAX-DAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either, minting FIAT, and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure. **This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs.**

- With Hidden Hand, it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs. We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC-20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols. And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer, deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools.

- The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve → Rari Fuse flow.

**What we would like to discuss in this thread, however, is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves.** Given the nature of FIAT (i.e. CDP architecture, stablecoin backing, audited collateral issuers), we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential [A coefficients](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/stable-math). If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic, please share your opinion in the thread!

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the [Security](https://github.com/fiatdao/security) repo within our Github.

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each. A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges.

5. **Market History:** $FIAT has been transferable since April 2022. It previously reached a high watermark of $1.3M deposited on Curve.

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live.

### Introduction

Whitelist the DFX Finance Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the DFX Finance community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

### Motivation

DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. We are prepared to engage with the Balancer ecosystem in a meaningful way, and would like to participate in governance and incentivizing liquidity to flow through Balancer.

### Risks

DFX Finance’s multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

Whitelist the OlympusDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the OlympusDAO community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

**Motivation**

Olympus DAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the OHM token. Each OHM token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, FRAX, wETH) in the Olympus treasury, giving it an intrinsic value. Olympus also introduces novel economic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. Olympus sees Balancer as a viable partner with an ecosystem that offers a lot of potential integration opportunities, this is evident in the proposal for the [OHM-DAI-wETH veBAL gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/ohm-eth-dai-50-25-25-gauge/3023/9). The DAO is looking for a closer partnership to participate in governance and incentivizing more liquidity to flow through Balancer.

**Risks**

OlympusDAO multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

**Protocol Description:**

> DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. Using a hyper-efficient AMM, optimized for low volatility trading, DFX provides FX swaps with rates that will beat any bank, money changer, or FX platform. DFX Pools currently have over $40M in TVL. DFX is the governance token of DFX Finance which allows users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO, and also allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the DFX ecosystem.

**Price History DFX:**

>Price History for DFX can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfx-finance)

**Motivation:**

> The DFX/ETH 50/50, and DFX/TEL/USDC 40/40/20, needs incentivization to migrate meaningful amounts of liquidity over to the Balancer ecosystem, and to bring higher trading volumes to Balancer. As well, DFX Finance is committed to engage in the Hiddenhand Finance ecosystem in a meaningful way to further deepen DFX liquidity onchain.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** DFX tokens serve as the governance token for the DFX Finance protocol. DFX token holders can vote on governance proposals through DFX’s snapshot. DFX forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.DFX Finance also has plans to transition to a veDFX model to further improve on decentralizing governance of the protocol.   

2. **Oracles:** DFX token does not rely on any external oracles. The DFX stablecoin pools uses Chainlink for its real world forex price feeds to facilitate efficient stablecoin swaps close to the spot price. The feeds can be found here: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat)

3. **Audits:** DFX has engaged with multiple auditors including engagements with Trail of Bits, Haechi, and Zellic to audit the DFX smart contracts.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Treasury functions are controlled by a 2/4 multisig including treasury yield farming, and paying bribes.

5. **Market History:** DFX has been transferable since March 2021. The oldest DFX pool on Balancer is 230 days old, with the highest daily volume of $4M. There is currently $420,000 worth of DFX liquidity on Balancer.

**Protocol Description:**

> DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. Using a hyper-efficient AMM, optimized for low volatility trading, DFX provides FX swaps with rates that will beat any bank, money changer, or FX platform. DFX Pools currently have over $40M in TVL. DFX is the governance token of DFX Finance which allows users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO, and also allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the DFX ecosystem.

**Price History DFX:**

>Price History for DFX can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfx-finance)

**Motivation:**

> The DFX/ETH 50/50, and DFX/TEL/USDC 40/40/20, needs incentivization to migrate meaningful amounts of liquidity over to the Balancer ecosystem, and to bring higher trading volumes to Balancer. As well, DFX Finance is committed to engage in the Hiddenhand Finance ecosystem in a meaningful way to further deepen DFX liquidity onchain.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** DFX tokens serve as the governance token for the DFX Finance protocol. DFX token holders can vote on governance proposals through DFX’s snapshot. DFX forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.DFX Finance also has plans to transition to a veDFX model to further improve on decentralizing governance of the protocol.   

2. **Oracles:** DFX token does not rely on any external oracles. The DFX stablecoin pools uses Chainlink for its real world forex price feeds to facilitate efficient stablecoin swaps close to the spot price. The feeds can be found here: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat)

3. **Audits:** DFX has engaged with multiple auditors including engagements with Trail of Bits, Haechi, and Zellic to audit the DFX smart contracts.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Treasury functions are controlled by a 2/4 multisig including treasury yield farming, and paying bribes.

5. **Market History:** DFX has been transferable since March 2021. The oldest DFX pool on Balancer is 230 days old, with the highest daily volume of $4M. There is currently $420,000 worth of DFX liquidity on Balancer.

**Protocol Description:**

See here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708

Centered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.

**Motivation:**

The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the 80/20 AURA/ETH pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for AURA in the years to come.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

As we near the start of vlAURA voting the possibility of using a single snapshot space has been [discussed](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/snapshot-proposal-config-change-to-support-aggregated-voters/3049/7). This would simplify things significantly compared to Aura running their own snapshot then transferring the results into Balancer’s. The Aura team has graciously designed the [necessary strategy](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/pull/657) so all that is left is to add this strategy to Balancer’s snapshot. This will allow vlAURA holders to vote with weight proportional to the veBAL held by Aura.

In combination with this and the expected increase in veBAL supply coinciding with Aura’s launch I also propose raising the quorum from 100k veBAL to 200k veBAL. This number may need to be increased even further and should be reassessed after a new baseline is established over the next couple of months. Additionally, we have implemented a new policy of only passing transactions to the DAO Multisig for signatures once a week on Tuesday. This is intended to reduce the frequency of signing requests. Given the three day voting window, we will now aim to bundle proposals together for simultaneous vote once a week on Thursdays. Any successful proposals that require DAO Multisig execution would be initiated for signing that Tuesday.

Finally, control over the balancer.eth ENS will also be passed to the DAO Multisig. Before that is done, snapshot admin will be set to the [Emergency subDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x63fab7ab9ef5b9579dabb82058b8ea309e39c766d435438b55fff8db7c1f69fd) Multisig `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`. After this proposal any future updates to snapshot would be handled by the Emergency subDAO.

### Risks

* Time sensitive proposals like BIP-6 where user funds are involved could be needlessly delayed. Thus, there is an exception for any proposal considered time sensitive or emergency in nature - these proposals may go to a vote on any day of the week and be passed to the DAO Multisig immediately upon a successful vote.
* We may fail to hit the new quorum in the next few votes. This risk must be considered by the community against the value of a higher quorum. Aura causing a big increase in veBAL supply may not translate into vlAURA holders actively participating in governance.

### Specification

If approved, the following will be in effect:

* The Balancer team will add the strategy created by the Aura team to Balancer’s snapshot. Then snapshot admin will be set to the Emergency subDAO Multisig `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`
* Ownership of Balancer.eth ENS will be given to the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`
* The quorum on snapshot will be increased to 200,000 veBAL
* Most proposals will only be eligible to go to a vote on Thursdays
* Most proposals requiring execution by the DAO Multisig will only be initiated on Tuesdays","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[159319.1486893428, 1763.3421575935984]",1

The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the auraBAL/(8020 BAL/ETH BPT) pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for auraBAL in the years to come.

10% of Aura's total AURA supply is being directed to the Chef contract (0x1ab80F7Fb46B25b7e0B2cfAC23Fc88AC37aaf4e9) over 4-5 years. This flow can be diverted to provide additional rewards on top of the existing BAL & AURA that will be received as part of the natural Gauge deposits. It will also give Aura the opportunity to use this allocation to bribe voters and fuel the secondary market developing around veBAL voting.

As you may have seen, Synthetix [recently addressed](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161/9) the 'Medium Severity Bug' identified last month. The team at Balancer Labs has put a contract together that will move the affected funds from the 'ProtocolFeeCollector' back to the Vault which will restore normal operation. I propose executing this contract as soon as possible.

### Specification

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `grantRoles` with the arguments:

Roles can be verified [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/action-id-task/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L457). The first role allows the contract to allowlist tokens in `ProtocolFeeWithdrawer`, which will enable it to remove SNX, sBTC, and sUSD from the denylist. The second role allows the contract to call `withdrawCollectedFees` on the `ProtocolFeeWithdrawer`, which will enable it to send the affected funds back to the vault.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[153826.24741539184, 0]",1

As most of you are aware, the Tribe DAO has [applied for a veBAL allowlisting last month](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888), that was granted by the Balancer DAO, and 112,041 B-80BAL-20WETH tokens were successfully locked into veBAL last month.

The Tribe DAO also owns 252,865 B-70WETH-30FEI BPTs, a pool token that has a gauge, and we staked the BPTs in the gauge, earning BAL for around 3 weeks.

Contract used for vote-locking and gauge staking :

https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2

During our periodic reward harvesting 2 weeks ago, we noticed that our contract could not claim the BAL rewards associated with gauge staking, only the BAL and bb-a-USD associated with veBAL holding.

After discussion with the Balancer team, the issue was identified : BAL is not distributed through the gauge system, but through a BalancerMinter contract that is connected to the gauge system. The Tribe devs did a mistake, as we wanted to re-use the voting escrow and gauge management contracts we used for Angle Protocol, but it turns out that Angle Protocol distributes their ANGLE differently, directly through the gauges and not through a minter (like Curve and Balancer), so we did not have any capability to interact with the BalancerMinter. We tested and successfully claimed empty rewards on the gauge without revert, but just assumed no BAL were distributed because the gauge weight of the FEI pool was zero.

The Tribe DAO’s vote-locker has been deployed as an immutable contract, and it is now impossible to add the capability to interact with the BalancerMinter and claim the BAL rewards associated with gauge-staked BPTs.

As a result, the Tribe DAO farmed 34,344 BAL that will be forever unclaimable on the BalancerMinter.

We would like to ask the Balancer DAO to OTC these BAL tokens back to us (on [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5bb8F0253776beC6FF450c2B40f092f7e7f5b57)). We do realize that there is absolutely no obligation to do so on your part, and that the mistake was ours, but Balancer is a very strategic move for the Tribe DAO (even more so with the [FEI<>FRAX partnership](https://tribe.fei.money/t/frax-x-fei-stablecoin-alliance/4292) potentially coming), and these BAL will never enter circulation and will forever be unclaimable otherwise. The Tribe DAO will continue to renew its veBAL locking from the current contract, but we are going to deploy a new gauge staking contract [shortly](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/pull/799) (edit - deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf53e251352683155898295569d77b8506ba00d80) behind [eip-1967](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2) proxy).

As some have noticed, the [CREAM/WETH gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/cream-weth-80-20-gauge/3165) we recently approved has been allocated over 40% of BAL emissions. In concert with that, the swap fee on the pool has been set to 10%. This has exposed a hole in our gauge requirements that should be remedied for all past and future gauges. By setting the swap fee to 10% they are attempting to prevent trading in the pool in order to passively farm BAL rewards. 

* For each gauge, the underlying pool's owner must be set to Balancer Governance. If this is not the case, a very good reason must be presented in the gauge proposal

* If Balancer Governance is not the owner, any proposed change to the swap fee must be communicated to Balancer's community in the #swap-fee-and-amplification channel in Balancer's discord. This must be done at least 24h in advance of the change being made and the change can only be made if the Ballers (Balancer community contributors) are in favor.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines for existing gauges where the owner is not Balancer Governance will open the possibility for the [Emergency subDAO](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197) to kill the gauge at their discretion if they believe the swap fee change to be malicious (causing liquidity to be unusable). 

# Risk

* The actor(s) performing these malicious actions together likely have enough voting power to vote down this proposal on snapshot. If they do that, I would petition the Emergency subDAO to kill the gauge and classify this as a governance attack. Up to the other six members if they agree with that assessment or not. 

# Specification

If approved, the above guidelines will immediately and retroactively go into effect. Due to the time sensitive nature, the vote will likely begin later today but discussion can and should continue while the vote is ongoing.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[260257.82976641724, 0]",1

Balancer recently [launched](https://op.beets.fi/#/pools) on Optimism in collaboration with BeethovenX. This deployment will soon utilize veBAL gauges for BAL emissions so it is important that BAL maintains adequate liquidity and price equivalence with Ethereum. To get around the 7 day withdrawal period on the official Optimism bridge which breaks the necessary arbitrage loop with Ethereum I have enlisted the help of [Multichain](https://multichain.xyz/). They have added support for BAL between Ethereum and Optimism, however [it requires liquidity to be functional](https://docs.multichain.org/for-partners/for-partners/faq).

Thus, I propose allocating BAL from the treasury for this purpose. Please see the poll at the bottom which will serve as a temp check on the amount. Note that we would earn [bridge fees](https://medium.com/multichainorg/anyswap-fees-explained-bceddf535b83) on any funds deposited for bridge liquidity.

The treasury [currently holds ~4M BAL](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f/balances) so you can calculate the impact to the treasury from there depending on your poll choice.

# Risk

* Multichain is exploited and our BAL is lost. You can find information about [their security model here](https://docs.multichain.org/getting-started/security/security-model).

* Users only bridge in one direction, i.e. Optimism-> Ethereum and instead use the official bridge for Ethereum-> Optimism. This would see bridge liquidity on one side drained and we would be unable to withdraw our BAL until this was resolved somehow.

## I. Introduction

This proposal aims to outline how the funding and accountability process will work for any entity wishing to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. To recap the journey so far, in early 2022 [subDAO’s were formed](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66) to give community contributors a formalized structure with clearly defined domains. More recently, the DAO has chosen to [incorporate a foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x357877d9d3d121e929f66cad2349987fc658be449585f8d021319b69a3a0e620) in order to engage with service providers who require formal contracts.

This framework aims to deliver the following benefits:

* Streamlined process for funding service providers
* Clear and decentralized accountability mechanisms
* Creation of a delegate system to enable a transparent dialogue between proposers and large token holders

## II. Process for Funding Service Providers

A service provider (“SP”) is an entity with a budget attached to it, managed by one or more Leaders, that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve one or more long term goals in the Balancer Ecosystem. When choosing to pursue funding as a SP or through the Grants program, a rough guideline is short term or one off engagements requiring $100k or less should go through Grants. A longer term engagement or one with a cost beyond $100k should be pursued as a SP.

To keep things simple, the terms “service provider”, “working group”, and “subDAO” are considered synonyms and interchangeable. A SP can be an incorporated legal entity or simply a loosely organized group of anonymous Balancer contributors. In order to interface with the Foundation a legal agreement is required so any SP taking advantage of the Foundation must be a legal entity or a natural person.

SP's have an option to make their funding proposal through the Foundation. If it is made through the Foundation, the Foundation will create the funding proposal on the forum on behalf of the SP. The SP is expected to answer any community questions or concerns raised on the forum. Funding will be distributed to the Foundation’s wallet on a quarterly basis and from there distributed to the SP on a defined monthly basis. If the SP does not go through the Foundation then funding will be distributed directly to the SP on a quarterly basis.

*All funding proposals must include “Domains of Operation” and “Key Objectives”.*

### II.1 Domains of Operation

Examples of Domains might be core protocol development, partner integrations, marketing, business development, front end, community, etc. While some overlap is acceptable (multiple SP’s operating in the same Domains) it is generally not an effective use of DAO funds to have multiple marketing teams or multiple teams managing the community for example. Clearly indicating Domains of Operation and the expertise an SP brings to that Domain will reduce inefficient overlap and help to increase coordination in the event of necessary or useful overlap. Having multiple SP’s building front ends might represent a useful overlap, for example.

Each SP should make clear how they will handle record keeping and the handover of those records in the event they are offboarded. If an SP proposes to enter a domain of operation already occupied by another approved SP, the proposal should outline how they plan to coordinate efforts to avoid the DAO paying double for the same work. It is expected that the work product of each SP is made available to the community on a regular basis.

### II.2 Key Objectives

Key Objectives should be high level goals the SP plans to work towards and accomplish during the funding period. If appropriate, these might be broken down into a list of specific tasks. It is important that the DAO have a clear idea of what the SP is doing while also leaving enough flexibility for innovation and efficiency. Providing success metrics will also ensure the community can easily evaluate performance.

Finally, a brief overview of how the funds would be spent is the last requirement. In the event of an SP requiring additional funds before the end of the funding period a supplemental budget request can be made in the same format as a regular funding request. An estimate of the SP’s monthly spend should be included which will be used to calculate the quarterly distribution of funds.

*All SP’s going through the Foundation must upload a copy of their “Service Level Agreement” or SLA to ipfs and include the link in their funding proposal.*

## III. Accountability Mechanisms

We must ensure any funds disbursed from the DAO treasury are used transparently and in service of the Balancer Ecosystem. Ultimately veBAL holders are responsible for ensuring SP’s are delivering enough value to justify the cost of funding them. We propose the following rules for holding SP’s accountable:

* All SP’s must hold monthly community calls in any online venue of their choosing as long as it is open to the public. Failure to hold a monthly call will prevent the Foundation or the DAO from disbursing future funds. The recordings of these community calls must stay available for at least 3 months after the community call has wrapped up.
* In combination with the monthly community call, a monthly summary must also be created which details progress towards each “Key Objective” outlined by the SP in their funding proposal. This should be posted to Balancer’s forum in advance of the monthly community call.
* Anyone can make a forum proposal to the DAO to stop the Foundation/DAO from disbursing future funds to the SP. Such a proposal should include: SP in question, reason to halt funding, supporting evidence, and any other comments.
* If the vote passes, all future funding to that SP will be halted until a new funding proposal is successfully approved. If it fails, funding continues as normal.
* There will be an internal monthly meeting with mandatory attendance by at least one representative of every actively funded SP. The goal of this meeting is to ensure all SP’s are strategically aligned across the ecosystem. Ideally each SP should keep their representative the same month to month.

Every member of Balancer’s community shares responsibility for ensuring SP’s that receive funding from the treasury are acting in the best interest of the Balancer ecosystem. The rules outlined above empower every community member to act if they feel an SP is no longer acting in that best interest. The Foundation is an agent of the DAO and must honor the outcome of any legitimate snapshot vote, subject to any applicable Laws/Acts and Regulations.

## IV. Contribution Funding Pathways
 
![486b132175a0785b857c6da537b78f149eafd618_2_624x339.png](ipfs://QmQWtsoMzcvCBcu4WxMQLo2Bb9V48k2gn72pnkNgUik1ee)
    
## V. Delegate System

While anyone can initiate a proposal to stop funding a SP it is large veBAL holders who have the strongest incentive to ensure SP’s are delivering value. The creation of a delegate system will lead to a more transparent and productive dialogue between proposers and those with large voting power. We encourage anyone interested in being a delegate to present their platform to the community in the new “[Delegate Citadel](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)” section of the forum.

## VI. Voting

Delegates and token holders should not vote in favor to fund or against to defund a SP that they are working for or affiliated with. Additionally, SP’s should not compensate token holders monetarily in exchange for their votes (do not bribe on funding or defunding proposals).

There will be a third voting option added to snapshot to cover the case of a SP being affiliated with many large veBAL holders and thus failing to pass a proposal to fund them because so much voting power cannot vote in good faith. For each SP funding proposal, there will be “Yes”, “No”, and “Abstain”. It is expected that delegates and any token holders with a potential conflict of interest regarding a particular SP will only vote for “Abstain” if they choose to vote at all and provide the reason for doing so.

## VII. Risk Assessment

There are various risks to the ecosystem that could arise from the adoption of this proposal.

* A veBAL token holder might work for a SP (or the SP might have holdings of veBAL itself) and vote in favor of funding the SP despite this conflict of interest.
* A SP might get funded and not follow through on their key objectives. With funds sent on a quarterly basis, this could result in a sizable loss of funds.
* Balancer sees multiple SP funding requests and if all were funded this would represent an unsustainable burn rate.

The way to mitigate these risks is to foster an active and engaged community. Conflicts of interest should be declared up front to prevent any appearance of impropriety. Unknown or new SP’s might want to request a lower funding amount and/or utilize milestone based payments as a trial period. If milestone based payments are utilized they should be overseen by the Grants Service Provider. Delegates and those community members who handle management of treasury funds should speak up about the impact funding SP’s will have on the treasury - and it is a good idea for each SP to include their assessment of that impact in their proposal if they can.

The responsibility for stewarding the Balancer ecosystem towards a bright future lies with veBAL holders and delegates. We could try to create many rules to address many possible scenarios but we see value in creating a simple and flexible framework for funding all kinds of Balancer contributors.

## VIII. Specification

If this proposal passes, the following will be in effect:

* Any future funding proposals must adhere to the guidelines as described above. **Please find an [example template here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/how-to-create-a-funding-proposal/3233)**.
* The Ops subDAO will dissolve at the end of the second quarter. After salaries are paid for June, any remaining funds will be returned to the DAO Multisig. All powers held by Ops will return to veBAL governance.
* This proposal will mark the start of a new tracking system, BIP or Balancer Improvement Proposal. When a proposal is added to snapshot it will be given a BIP number - consider this proposal to be BIP-1.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[109437.36427041332, 492.7879910554319]",1

You may not have noticed but we are in the midst of a significant bear market for the price of BAL. This fact combined with the desire to expand the number of contributors in the Balancer ecosystem has led the Treasury subDAO to explore ways to bolster the DAO’s stablecoin reserves. One possibility is through the use of a Ribbon Finance treasury vault for BAL.

The DAO would deposit BAL into this vault and sell monthly calls - two quotes provided by Ribbon are as follows:

* Using a strike 25% out of the money, we can expect 3.17% yield per month -> 38% APY
* Using a strike 50% out of the money, we can expect 0.91% yield per month -> 10.92% APY

Ribbon vaults operate using [cash settled](https://optionalpha.com/lessons/physical-vs-cash-settlement-options#:~:text=Physically%20settled%20options%20are%20contracts,at%20the%20time%20of%20expiration.) options rather than physical settlement. This means in the event of the option expiring in the money the vault would transfer the cash value of the option (denominated in BAL) to the market maker. Effectively if the price of BAL goes up significantly during the month we will incur a loss then continue as normal and sell the next month’s call option. In comparison, physical settlement would mean we are obligated to sell all of our BAL at the strike price (minus slippage) if the option expires in the money.

Ribbon has signaled they are prepared to support cash or physical settlement - in both cases any BAL transferred to market makers in the event of a call option expiring in the money would be market sold. This is why slippage is taken into account when the market makers will quote us the price for the physical settlement option.

The exact amount of BAL to use for this is up for discussion. 500k BAL has been discussed but we could go as low as 250k BAL. The collected premium would be in USDC and would be available to withdraw from our vault every month.

Assuming we deposit 500k BAL, that represents around 12% of the BAL in the treasury valued at ~$4M ($8 BAL). A 38% APY would lead to a gain of ~$1.5M and 10.92% APY to a gain of ~$436k.

# Risks

* The Ribbon Vault is exploited and we lose our entire deposit
  * [Nexus Mutual offers insurance](https://app.nexusmutual.io/cover/buy/get-quote?address=0x25751853Eab4D0eB3652B5eB6ecB102A2789644B) on Ribbon Vaults which does cover their treasury products. This is an option the community can consider. For reference, the cost is 50.79 ETH for 1955 ETH worth of coverage for one year. 
* The price of BAL rises significantly during the month
  * We will incur a loss if we use cash settled options. Assuming we sell calls 25% out of the money: +50% at expiration -> ~9.7% loss. +100%, ~32% loss.

# Specification

If this vote passes, the DAO will allocate 500k BAL to sell monthly calls 25% out of the money with cash settlement. The DAO Multisig would transfer 500k BAL to the Ribbon Vault. The address of that vault would be independently confirmed via at least two sources.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[24831.862224835342, 146268.9964414148]",0

**Introduction:**

Stake DAO is a non-custodial platform built on top of decentralized protocols that enables anyone to easily grow their crypto portfolio.

Among the various services that Stake DAO offers, Stake DAO allowed users to stake their CRV tokens, which were locked in to veCRV on Curve, in exchange for sdveCRVs.

**Motivation**:

Stake DAO users used this service and the sdveCRVs received in return for the users' CRV lock were subsequently placed in the Balancer Pool to provide liquidity on sdveCRV/CRV. As a result,

StakeDAO had 83,053.205742818150358418 3CRV stuck in sdveCRV contract and only the Balancer vault address was eligible to claim them

However, because of the specificities of the Balancer Pool and sdveCRV contract, claiming these 3CRV was impossible for Stake DAO. Therefore, to recover and redistribute the 3CRV rewards to the users who had initially entrusted CRV to Stake DAO, it was agreed with the Balancer and Stake DAO to move these 3CRV stucked to the Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector (0xce88686553686da562ce7cea497ce749da109f9f) and then send them back to the Stake DAO multisig address, via this proposal, to allow Stake DAO to redistribute them to the eligible users.

**Risks**: There is no specific risk associated with this proposal

**Specification**:

Balancer & Stake DAO have agreed that the exchange will take place as follows

Liquidity gauge depositors can receive not only BAL, but also extra tokens (called 'reward tokens'). On Ethereum L1, this is relatively straightforward, and there's already a subDAO managing this. On child chains however (i.e. non-Ethereum L1 chains, such as Polygon or Arbitrum), this task is a bit more nuanced, as the gauge system allows for irrecoverable user error.

[`ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/liquidity-mining/contracts/admin/ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder.sol) is a module that makes adding reward tokens to child chain gauges much safer, and should  be the only means by which this is done.

# Specification

The `ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder` contract (deployment addresses found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220527-child-chain-gauge-token-adder)) must be granted permission to call `IChildChainStreamer.add_reward` and `IRewardsOnlyGauge.set_rewards` via the AuthorizerAdaptor. Then, the LM multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` must be granted permission to call `ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder.addTokenToGauge`.

## Execution details

This will be done in multiple networks: the named arguments below should be replaced with the actual constants specified later.

Call `grantRolesToMany` on the Authorizer, with:
 - `roles`: 
   - `add_reward_role`
   - `set_rewards_role`
   - `addTokenToGauge_role`
 - `accounts`:

# Risks

The LM multisig could misuse its permission and add incorrect or faulty tokens to the gauges. Since these have a limit of 8 tokens and they cannot be removed, such a situation would require a gauge migration.

Alternatively, the LM multisig could designate a distributor that sets overly long distribution durations (e.g. 5000 years), which would effectively make the distributions unusable.

No funds are at risk. The only funds potentially affected are those being distributed, which could be re-distributed over an over by a malicious distributor, dilluting the effective distributon rate.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[126638.19455664276, 0]",1

As explained in [this other post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/tribe-dao-unclaimable-bal-rewards/3196), the Tribe DAO now has a 2-contract setup to interact with the veBAL system:

* [VeBalDelegatorPCVDeposit](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2) vote-locks the 112,041 B-80BAL-20WETH tokens held by the DAO into veBAL
* [BalancerGaugeStaker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf53e251352683155898295569d77b8506ba00d80) (behind [eip-1967 proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2)) to stake the protocol-owned liquidity BPTs in various gauges (e.g. the 252,865 B-70WETH-30FEI currently held)

This approach does not allow our gauge staking to benefit from veBAL boosting (that can boost BAL earned from the LM program by up to 2.5x if the staking is spread across enough gauges).

After discussions with the Balancer Labs team (and particularly Nicolas Venturo), a solution to this problem could be for the Balancer devs to deploy a new version VotingEscrowDelegation contract that include methods that allow the Tribe DAO to delegate its boost from the [VeBalDelegatorPCVDeposit](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2) to the [BalancerGaugeStaker eip-1967 proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2) (and hardcode the existing 6 boost delegations in the constructor of the new contract, to keep the same delegations during migration).

Would the Balancer DAO consider doing this small migration soon, before Convex-like platforms launch (at which point, a lot more boost delegations will happen, and migration will be harder) ?

Thanks,

Erwan

 - a preseeding with [all of the boosts created until now](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220530-preseeded-voting-escrow-delegation/input.ts#L31) (these can be found by looking at interactions with the [current delegation contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e96068b3d5b5bae3d7515da4a1d2e52d08a2647)
- a preseeding with [a call to set the address designated above as the operator of the TribeDAO contract](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220530-preseeded-voting-escrow-delegation/input.ts#L73). This will let the operator call `create_boost`, `extend_boost`, etc., using TribeDAO's veBAL balance.

The preseeding was executed in [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1e59b4c0b88757ed73a820b6586bfd25c0fa02d84baac5f04fad40085d553ea1), which can be inspected to look at the boosts created and approvals granted.

The address of the new delegator can be found [on the Balancer Labs repository](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220530-preseeded-voting-escrow-delegation/output/mainnet.json#L2). For a migration to happen, the delegation proxy's `setDelegation` function must be called from an authorized account (one with the permission `0xac0fcdc4520d7bde1c58bbefd7c8dd39aaf382a20c27991134c14fe63d2c96f3`).

It should be noted that any boosts created starting now will not be migrated as they're not included in the preseeding, and would require manual re-creation.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[124893.00089974616, 0]",1

Paladin already has a tight history with Balancer. The PAL token was made transferable via an [LBP on Balancer via Prime Launch](https://launch.prime.xyz/lbp/0x531BCa3d4c1a53f856d90B0D4461E1f6Bd648f6D). The Balancer pool has been there since the beginning but has failed to grow larger. 
We want to use BAL incentives via the gauge to attract more users to provide liquidity alongside our DAO and make this pool become the main stablecoin <> PAL bridge.


**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Paladin DAO is governed by holders of PAL, through snapshot votes and forum proposals.

https://gov.paladin.vote/

https://signal.paladin.vote/#/    

2. **Oracles:** None, we use Coingecko.

3. **Audits:** 
All daps have been audited.
https://doc.paladin.vote/security/audits

4. **Centralization vectors:** Treasury functions and smart contract proxy updates are controlled through a 5/9 multisig.



5. **Market History:** PAL was made transferable on Balancer via a dutch auction and now has liquidity on 3 DEXs on Ethereum (Balancer, Curve & Uniswap). PAL averages 20,000$ of daily volume and has a total depth of ~2M$.

**Summary**:

Whitelist Stake DAO to allow the protocol to lock B-80BAL-20WETH, and create a liquid locker and the associated strategies.

**Rationale**

Stake DAO is a non-custodial platform built on top of decentralized protocols that enables anyone to easily grow their crypto portfolio, which recently released a new feature called the Liquid Lockers that will help accelerate the lock of tokens with a ve model.

It’s a new feature built for tokens with ve model allowing users to keep a liquid position while enjoying some yield and the associated voting power (which can both be boosted with veSDT)

The liquid locker will allow users to lock B-80BAL-20WETH and receive sdBAL, which can either be staked in the reward contract, or used to add liquidity in the strategy. sdBAL holders will be able to earn a native yield, vote or sell proposals & gauges boosted positions voting power, while keeping a liquid position.

The strategy will require a gauge for the sdBAL/B-80BAL-20WETH pool on Balancer, to ensure the liquidity of the token.

Furthermore, as other protocols have done it, Balancer could help seed the liquidity pool to ensure liquidity for sdBAL while generating revenues for Balancer.

**Technical implementation:**

Include sdBAL locker in the Smart Wallet Whitelist `0xea79d1A83Da6DB43a85942767C389fE0ACf336A5`

# Motivation

The launch of Balancer on Optimism by BeethovenX is fast approaching. Initially the plan was to plug into veBAL gauges and voting but we are re-assessing this in light of the recent stable pool bug report and unexpected behavior of the boosted UST pool on Fantom after the depeg. Rather than add non-boosted Optimism pools to veBAL voting then later add boosted pools it is preferable to wait on veBAL integration until the new boosted pools are ready. This allows Balancer Labs to focus their efforts on the most important priorities and BeethovenX can move quickly on Optimism using traditional liquidity mining for now. 

I propose Balancer allocates 31,250 BAL ($250k at $8 BAL) towards Optimism incentives from the treasury for a period of two months. If veBAL integration is completed before two months elapses any remaining BAL would be returned to the treasury. BeethovenX has a proposal to also supply $250k of BEETS under the same terms - if one proposal fails to pass then both are considered to fail and no money would be spent. As a reminder, protocol fees will be set at 50% and are split 50/50 so this is a fair arrangement. While liquidity mining in this manner is certainly not ideal it allows us to quickly proceed with the launch which has strategic value over the long run in my view. 

The following five Ballers will manage allocation of Balancer’s incentives: Mike B, Andrea, Zekraken, Xeonus, and Solarcurve. They will coordinate with their counterparts at BeethovenX. We hope to find some good opportunities to onboard early partners and offer an incentives match.

# Specification

If this vote passes and the simultaneous vote at BeethovenX passes, then 31,250 BAL would be transferred from the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` to the liquidity mining multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[185107.78324877832, 0]",1

# Motivation

For reference, [here is the passed vote](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x413ed9e7b742f4f843c55c1120c5660563449787be22afba7341bfe77a2bfb02) for funding 1inch's integration of boosted pools.

However, the conversation on the forum and other discussions led 1inch to expect payment in stables, specifically 300k bbaUSD. 

As you can see from the [analytics](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/Balancer-Pool-Analysis?1.%20Pool%20ID=0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe), 1inch represents a significant source of trading volume for bbaUSD. Given the large decline in BAL price since the original agreement I believe it is important we honor the original understanding and send the 300k bbaUSD as we discussed. I should have followed up with Kia to amend the proposal text - I will take extra care in the future to ensure the text of a proposal reflects any changes agreed upon in the discussion phase. 

Let's ensure our collaboration with 1inch gets off on the right foot and that we can both move forward in good faith as boosted pools take over DeFi.

*The treasury currently holds ~4.2M of stables (assuming Rari hack is repaid in full). This would represent ~7% of our stable reserves.*

## Vision

[Pickle Finance][2] aims to become the home for Balancer LPs to enjoy the best possible returns and to become a major collaborator in the governance of the Balancer Protocol. 

## Abstract

Pickle is building a module on top of Balancer's Gauge system that seeks to aid Balancer LPs and prospective `veBAL` participants in maximising the utility of their deposits with Balancer, while also enhancing the overall utility of the Balancer's Gauge system by creating a liquid `veBAL` derivative.

Similar to other ""boosting protocols"", Pickle aims to create these synergies by providing an easy mechanism for the aggregation of `veBAL` boosts and for prospective Balancer LPs to benefit from this boost.

The Pickle and Balancer teams are no strangers to each other, with Pickle being invited and expressing its willingness to join the Balancer Wars as early as the Gauge system was announced. Pickle has borrowed from its unique experience running a Gauge system for itself and building on top of other boosting modules like Convex to come up with a unique system we call the Brinery. 

As a gesture of goodwill and to encourage the creation and adoption of the Balancer Brinery, Pickle will be providing incentives (in `$PICKLE` tokens) to both those who vote to whitelist us and those who join the Brinery early on. These incentives will be detailed pending their approval by Pickle governance. The Balancer community can expect the Pickle Core team to propose between 2-3% of the `PICKLE` supply to be awarded to Balancer Brinery incentives, with rougly 80% of these reserved for joiners and 20% for voters.

This proposal makes no request to the Balancer community for financial assistance to Pickle. We are a solvent, revenue-generating protocol with a healthy balance sheet. Our interest is in providing a superior service to Balancer users and to create a symbiotic relationship between our communities.

## Brinery Specification: Architecture & Design

The Brinery will provide a seamless experience for users to join `veBAL`. Our proposed system works in the following manner: 
1. Users deposit 80/20 BAL/ETH `BPT` with Pickle
2. Users receive **brinBAL** in return
3. Under the hood, Pickle will:
  a) Lock up a portion of `BAL/ETH` for `veBAL` in perpetuity - a receipt token is issued for the locked amount as **pveBAL**. A portion of `BAL/ETH` liquidity is retained
  b) Supply `pveBAL` and retained `BAL/ETH` into a new Balancer pool
4. Users can redeem `brinBAL` for their proportionate share of `pveBAL` and `BAL/ETH` (or in a single asset if they wish)

This design has the advantage of guaranteeing liquidity for Pickle's `veBAL` derivative. The Brinery contracts will have flexibility in managing liquidity to achieve the proper balance between liquidity and maximal rewards. Users who hold `brinBAL` will receive Balancer governance rewards (all fee-sharing rewards, emissions, and bribe proceeds will be consolidated into BAL tokens), the Brinery's ""flywheel"" rewards (`BAL` ""taxed"" from Brinery boosted PickleJars), and of course `PICKLE` tokens. 

For users familiar with our standard PickleJar, a series of Brinery Boosted Jars, or ""brinJars"", will be on offer to compound users' BPT positions, taking advantage of boosted rewards from the Brinery's `veBAL` lock, alongside `PICKLE` incentives. These novel Balancer Jars will rely on state-of-the-art infrastructure and comply with the EIP-4626 standard for maximal efficiency, security, and composability. 

## Pickle

### History

Pickle is one of the original yield aggregators in DeFi, bringing innovations such as incentivised auto-farming with its PickleJars. We have been building as an Ethereum-based DAO since September 2020. Our builders are well-known and have collaborated over their time in DeFi with many top-notch protocols and teams to build, conduct security reviews, or brainstorm and validate ideas. To name a few: Yearn, Sushi, Curve, Polygon, Frax, Alchemix, and of course, Balancer.

Pickle has crossed paths with Balancer on several occasions. Pickle was the first yield aggregator to build on top of Balancer on its launch in Polygon. Moreover, our `PICKLE-ETH` was only the second pool after `BAL-ETH` to launch with Balancer on Arbitrum. A cursory look at the [BAL mining scripts on GitHub][1] shows we are 1 of 11 Balancer partners. On Arbitrum, we are 1 of 3. We are brethren in DeFi and hope to remain so for many years to come.

Finally, Pickle was the first-ever protocol to adapt Curve's Gauge system to align its users and token holders into a better governance system we call `DILL`. More than 51% of all `PICKLE` is currently locked for an average of 3.23 years, with almost 1,000 `DILL` holders forming the DAO that backs our protocol.

### Team

Pickle is led by myself, joined by the rest of the core team which currently consists of another 12 individuals with a wide range of skills in product, product marketing, UX design, smart contracts engineering, and frontend and Web3 infrastructure development. 

### Governance

Pickle is run according to the principle of ""progressive decentralisation"" by the DILL DAO. DILL governance is currently upgrading so DILL holders receive 100% of protocol revenues generated by Pickle, in ETH, plus PICKLE anti-dilutive rewards. At present, using Pickle's Gauge system, DILL holders can vote on-chain for where PICKLE emissions should go. With support for delegation currently in development, Pickle aims to launch its own ""Pickle voting module"" so users can participate in governance, including PICKLE emission allocations across sidechains, via secure offchain voting.

The Pickle voting module to provide DILL holders an interface for directing `veBAL` voting power held by Pickle's Balancer Brinery, as well as select the allocation of PICKLE emissions amongst our various Brinery products. 

## Specification

If this vote passes, the Balancer DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction with `0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C` calling the function `allowlistAddress` with the argument `0x93318d4b44558f57B688C6943fA9E2c3e52540B0`

# Motivation

The [Emergency DAO](https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers) is an idea pioneered by Curve that empowers a small group to “kill” pools and gauges in the event of malicious activity and/or potential loss of funds. So far the power has only been used once to [kill the Mochi pool](https://gov.curve.fi/t/the-curve-emergency-dao-has-killed-the-usdm-gauge/2307).

This proposal is being presented as a response to the situation Balancer is facing regarding the three element pools ([1](https://app.element.fi/pools/0xEdf085f65b4F6c155e13155502Ef925c9a756003?action=redeem))([2](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x4bd6D86dEBdB9F5413e631Ad386c4427DC9D01B2?action=redeem))([3](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x7Edde0CB05ED19e03A9a47CD5E53fC57FDe1c80c?action=redeem)) which were grandfathered into the gauge voting system when veBAL launched. A single LP has staked in the gauges and has bribed on hidden hand to entice voters while this single actor collects all the emissions.

Given that these element pools have expired they should no longer be eligible for BAL emissions.

The Emergency subDAO will be a 4-of-7 multisig with the following members:

* Solarcurve (0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3)
* Mike B (0xF01Cc7154e255D20489E091a5aEA10Bc136696a8)

Gnosis safe address: `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`

A governance proposal will be required to change signers of this multisig. To be clear, Balancer’s Emergency subDAO will only have the power to kill gauges. Balancer pools cannot be “killed” by governance after the pool factory has been deployed for three months.

An additional power of the Emergency subDAO will be to add a token to the deny list on the newly created “[ProtocolFeesWithdrawer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introduce-protocolfeeswithdrawer/3188)” contract. In order for a token to be added back to the allow list a veBAL governance vote would be required. A token would only be added to the deny list in the event of an issue along the lines of the recent [Synthetix bug disclosure](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161).

**Protocol Description:**

What is C.R.E.A.M. Finance?
CREAM Finance is a decentralized lending protocol for individuals and protocols to access financial services. The protocol is permissionless, transparent, and non-custodial.
Currently, CREAM is live on Polygon, Arbitrum and Binance Smart Chain .
CREAM Finance’s smart contract money markets are focused on longtail assets -- with the goal of increasing capital efficiency for all assets in crypto markets.
Users are able to lend any supported assets on our markets, and use the provided capital as collateral to borrow another supported asset.
CREAM offers a wide range of tokens on our money markets, including: stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD); interest-bearing stablecoins  defi tokens  LP-tokens  and other cryptocurrencies. This list is not exhaustive.

**Motivation:**

This proposal aims to add veBAL gauge for the CREAM/WETH 80/20 pool. BAL incentives would help deepen CREAM liquidity as 24-hour trading volume on exchange averages $2 million, it would bring sizable CREAM trading volume on Balancer.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:**
CREAM tokens serve as the governance token for the C.R.E.A.M. Finance network. CREAM token holders can vote on governance proposals through CREAM’s snapshot. CREAM forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.

2. **Oracles:** 
We have Chainlink as our main price oracle.

3. **Audits:** 
Audit Report: https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/CREAMSummary.pdf

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
      The token is not upgradeable or pausable.
      The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract.
      The team behind the token is known and can be held responsible for abuse.

5. **Market History:**
   Although CREAM protocol suffered a flash loan attack on its ETH platform, all other platforms are 
    currently functioning optimally.
    According to [defillama](https://defillama.com/protocol/cream-finance) Total Value Locked is $318.06

# Introduction

The recent [issue involving double-entrypoint tokens](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161), which includes SNX and sBTC, saw those tokens being transferred out of the Vault into the ProtocolFeeCollector. The multisig in charge of managing protocol fees [renounced the permission](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x62faf47ff5401dc7658b37344efd0800aa88ba34cf5c38c061e4487e4aaddaac) to withdraw them, meaning these user funds are now solely controlled by the Balancer Governance multisig. Until the situation is resolved however, regular protocol fee withdrawal and distribution (including revenue for veBAL holders) is halted.

This proposal provides a mechanism to continue with protocol fee distribution while keeping SNX and sBTC from LPs safe.

# Specification

We've developed a contract called [ProtocolFeesWithdrawer](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef4c5352882b10893b70DbcaA0C000965bd23c5), which forwards requests to withdraw tokens to the ProtocolFeesCollector, as long as the tokens are not included in a 'denylist' of tokens that cannot be withdrawn. This list can be updated by Balancer Governance.

By granting permission to the ProtocolFeesWithdrawer to withdraw from Collector, and to the [original Safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c68c42de679ffb0f16216154c996c354cf1161b) to initiate withdrawals on the Withdrawer, the multisig will regain the ability to manage protocol fees, but will be unable to withdraw any SNX or sBTC.

I propose we make the Withdrawer part of our permanent infrastructure, since it adds very little overhead and allows for measures like this one to be taken. This is not the first instance we've seen of tokens incorrectly landing in the ProtocolFeeCollector, and we might want to make use of these capabilities again in the future.

### Execution details
Call `grantRolesToMany` on the [Authorizer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa331d84ec860bf466b4cdccfb4ac09a1b43f3ae6), with:
* roles: `[0xb2b6e48fa160a7c887d9d7a68b6a9bb9d47d4953d33e07f3a39e175d75e97796, 0x826ac7ce861f2a54e071e6c724653757fdd1259804eb1ca7f040aa1cd09923fe]`
* accounts: `[0x5ef4c5352882b10893b70DbcaA0C000965bd23c5, 0x7c68c42de679ffb0f16216154c996c354cf1161b]`

This will grant role 0xb2b6...3ae6, which allows withdrawing from the FeeCollector (the same role renounced by the multisig) to the FeeWithdrawer. The address of the Withdrawer can be obtained from the [Balancer Labs deployments repository](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220517-protocol-fee-withdrawer/output/mainnet.json).

The second role granted is 0x826a...23fe, which allows withdrawing from the Withdrawer to the original multisig at 0x7c68...161b. The role can be obtained by [calling `getActionId` on the Withdrawer](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef4c5352882b10893b70DbcaA0C000965bd23c5#readContract) with 0x6daefab6, the selector of the `withdrawCollectedFees(address[],uint256[],address)` (i.e. the [first eight bytes of that hash](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html).

# Risks

The ProtocolFeesWithdrawer is intentionally extremely simple to minimize smart contract risk.

**Protocol Description**

The worlds first & only decentralized Web3 content marketing agency DAO. Massively scalable. Fueled by DeFi. 

We at CRE8R are a DAO of content creators that produce educational marketing content for our clients

**Motivation**
We have had some success with our pools on Beethoven-x
[CRE8R In F-Major] 
[CRE8R in BbMINOR]
(limited to 2 URL Links by posting restrictions)

We would like to expand our liquidity to L2s and plan to build one on OP if and when that goes live too. 


**Specification**

**Governance:** CRE8R DAO is governed by F100 (the founding 100 NFT holders) through snapshot votes and forum proposals.

**Oracles:** No use of oracles within the CRE8R DAO.

**Audits:** Nothing to Audit at this time

**Centralization vectors:** Specific treasury functions are controlled through a multisig such as treasury yield farming, paying bribes, and content creator salaries. 

**Market History:** CRE8R doesn't run a DeFi protocol with smart contracts, so there is not much need for this history. AFAIK. However we can say that we took on our first client on 7/7/2021 and have taking in over $950K in payments for services.

**Summary:**
> Proposal to add a gauge for the [WNCG/WETH Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xe8cc7e765647625b95f59c15848379d10b9ab4af0002000000000000000001de) on Ethereum mainnet.

    • Twitter: https://twitter.com/NineChronicles

**Protocol Description:**

> Nine Chronicles is a fully decentralized free-to-play RPG, based on Scandinavian mythology, and the first title to be developed with Libplanet (https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet). Nine Chronicles runs on a P2P network of players without requiring any central server to host. The entire game, from crafting an item to complex battles, takes place fully on-chain.
>
> The first alpha test of Nine Chronicles started in 2019 Q2, and the mainnet was launched in 2020 Q4. Currently Nine Chronicles community is comprised of players from more than 100 countries. As Nine Chronicles is fully open source, there are a number of modded game clients developed by community members.
>
>Nine Chronicles Gold (NCG) is the in-game currency on its own blockchain network and it can be bridged to Ethereum mainnet. WNCG is the wrapped version of NCG. Nine Chronicles players can acquire NCG in various way including getting in the high ranks in Arena, selling an item, and running a node. Here is [the 2022 roadmap of Nine Chronicles](https://ninechronicles.medium.com/2022-nine-chronicles-roadmap-is-here-df3d2b8e6e0d) and WNCG price history can be viewed on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-ncg).

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s weighted pool would help attract more liquidity with less impermanent loss comparing to 50/50 pool. Furthermore, adding the veBAL gauge will give bigger incentives to Nine Chronicles community members to deposit their tokens into Balancer pool, and will give deeper liquidity that would attract more users to trade on Balancer.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** The game protocol and Ethereum bridge is currently managed by multisig. The codes are fully open-source ([Nine Chronicles](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles), [NineChronicles.EthBridge](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles.EthBridge)) and the operations are fully shared and discussed in Discord.

2. **Oracles:** As the game and bridge are not using external information, the systems don’t rely on oracles. 

3. **Audits:** Here are the security [audit reports](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles.EthBridge/tree/main/docs) by Theori (won DEFCON CTF 5 times) and Certik for the Ethereum bridge.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Governance systems are yet to be fully decentralized and treasury functions are managed by multisig. The bridge is operated by using own Ethereum node adding to Infura.

5. **Market History:** As there is no DeFi protocol using WNCG, relevant events such as smart contract attacks or liquidations haven’t happened. There has been the Sushiswap pool for WNCG/ETH since MISO IDO in August 2021.

title: [Proposal] Whitelist Index Coop's Investment Account Gnosis Safe for Balancer's VotingEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Index Coop)
created: 10-05-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Index Coop DAO’s Investment Account address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Index Coop Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Index Coop has been in discussions with Balancer DAO about building indices products on Balancer v2 and just recently, created its first liquidity pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. This delta neutral pool of leverage trading products is the first basket of Index Coop products and symbolisies Index Coop’s strong desire to work with the Balancer community. Index Coop would like to continue investing in the Balancer community relationship by being able to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and to again, be an active participant within the Balancer DAO governance process.

At the time of writing, Index Coop has approximately $4.4M of capital deposited into the Balancer Boosted Pool on mainnet and to date has earned around 2,500 BAL, [6,7,8]. Index Coop intends to deposit BAL with ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool.

# Motivation

Index Coop intends to build financial products on Balancer v2. To date we have explored creating managed pools that resembled a basket of tokens much like DPI and more recently began exploring how to integrate several products into a single liquidity pool. We had hoped the LAYER1 product would be the first collaboration project and there was strong support within the Index Coop community to build this product on Balancer v2, [9]. It now appears, LAYER1 may not be the initial collaboration product and other opportunities are being explored.

In preparation, Index Coop deployed a portion of the DAOs stablecoins to earn BAL rewards with the intention of locking those BAL rewards and using the veBAL position to support growing future products developed on Balancer v2. With the introduction of ve tokenomics, there is a need for Index Coop to lock the BAL, attain the boosted rewards APY and maximise the veBAL holding potential in order to best support future product launches.

Index Coop has recently created a delta neutral Flexible Leverage Indice pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. These pools are the first pool where Index Coop is creating a basket of products in one pool. Longer term, the vision is to integrate various strategies like icETH into Balancer Boosted Pools via Index Coop’s exchange issuance. This is expected to offer users varying combinations of yield and risk profile investment options whilst also providing liquidity to the underlying assets.

Prior to the introduction of ve Tokenomics, Index Coop was a keen participant in Balancer DAO’s governance process. Index Coop participated as a DAO on 27 BAL votes, [10]. Although Index Coop’s holding is small, it can still be used to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process.

# Specification

**Introduction**
Whitelist the VitaDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock the B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the VitaDAO community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO, and vote on increased rewards for the Vita<>ETH pools.

**Motivation**
VitaDAO is a community DAO funding longevity research, and is a big fan and longer-term collaborator with Balancer, having its main liquidity pools listed with Balancer, and incentivising them with $vita rewards.

If the community would support it, we'd love to engage in Balancer DAO governance through veBAL.

**Risks**
VitaDAO multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

title: [Proposal] Whitelist the Aave Mainnet Reserve Factor for Balancer’s VoteEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Llama)
created: 23-04-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Aave DAO’s Reserve Factor address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Aave Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Llama has published proposals on the Aave DAO and Balancer DAO governance forum for both communities to perform a 200,000 BAL for AAVE tokenswap, [2,3,4]. Upon completing this tokenswap, Aave intends to deposit BAL and ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool. This proposal is to enable Aave to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and become an active contributor within the Balancer governance process.

# Motivation

Aave and Balancer communities have a long working relationship. Aave has incorporated the 80/20 AAVE/ETH Balancer V1 BPT into the Safety Module and intends to upgrade to using a Balancer V2 pool in time. Meanwhile, Balancer’s USDC/DAI/USDT Boosted Pool uses Aave V2 in the background as a source of yield for liquidity providers. Both communities have demonstrated the ability to work together and create value for each other’s community. The tokenswap is the next logical step in creating an ever stronger relationship.

At the time of writing the Aave mainnet Reserve Factor holds 1,924 aBAL and this will become around 201,924 BAL post tokenswap, [2,5]. If the Aave community elects to proceed with an on-market purchase of 100,000 BAL, the total BAL holding will become 301,924 and Aave will become one of the Top 30 holders [6,7]. Aave intends to use the veBAL holding to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process and to support the pools that lead to funds being deposited into Aave markets and/or Safety Module.

# Risks

No significant risks have been identified in connection with the proposed transaction.

# Specification

Whitelist `0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c` to interact with the veBAL contract, [5].

**Summary**

Stader proposes adding a gauge for the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer. MaticX is a liquid token for Matic staking built by StaderLabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~770 mn $ in TVL. The incentivization of the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help:

1. Build deep liquidity would be a prerequisite to make staked Matic truly liquid in the Polygon Defi ecosystem and incentives would be an important mechanism to aid this
2. Establish Balancer as the prime DEX for Matic <> MaticX pool. Two reasons why this is important:
  1. $3 bn in assets locked in polygon staking currently that is set to be unlocked by liquid staking solutions like MaticX
  2. With its metastable pool technology, Balancer is best placed to serve Matic <> MaticX

**# References/Useful links**

* Website: https://staderlabs.com/

**Protocol description**

*Background on Staderlabs:*

StaderLabs is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider. We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera.

Within a few months of launch, Stader has more than 770 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform.

1. ~ $700 M+ Luna staked
2. ~$60 M+ HBAR staked
3. Over 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts

Stader Protocol’s native token is the SD Token, and we have incentivized liquidity pools on other DEXes by giving out rewards in SD tokens (listed on coin gecko). 

*About MaticX:*

MaticX is a liquid token that users get when they stake their Matic with Stader. The MaticX tokens are a representation of users’ staked Matic. They allow users to swap them at a later date for their staked Matic and accrued rewards with Stader. Meanwhile, they will be able to use it on multiple protocols on Polygon to participate in DeFi. MaticX is an ERC20 token.

Safety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard user’s funds. MaticX contracts have been audited successfully by two reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. 

**Motivation**

Adding incentivization to the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help unlock the large liquidity currently locked in staked Matic for the Polygon and Balancer community and in the process, bring significant liquidity and trading volumes to the Balancer ecosystem

* Liquid staking is large and MaticX aims to be the primary liquid staking token for Polygon:
  * Staking on polygon currently has ~3bn $ of assets staked. Liquid staking can help unlock a large part of this for use in the Defi ecosystem making this an asset class of interest to the Polygon and Balancer communities
  * Stader’s experience in building strong liquid staking solutions on multiple chains, especially Terra and Hedera, with ~770 mn$ in TVL makes it one of the leading candidates to help unlock this liquidity through MaticX
  * MaticX is off to a strong start within a few weeks of launch with staking TVL for Matic already at 2.5+ Million Matic. We also recently launched staking on the Polygon Mainnet directly (Polygon's staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supported staking Matic on Ethereum) and this will help increase staking penetration and in turn, MaticX
  * We will build deep liquidity for MaticX to truly enable users to unlock their staked assets and participate in Defi on Polygon. The MaticX <> Matic LP is already live on Quickswap and has a liquidity of around 5 million USD with average daily trading volume of $246,333 in the last 7 days (Apr 27-May 3)
  * We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon)
* Balancer is best suited to provide deep liquidity for Matic<>MaticX given its unique metastable pool technology, a great fit for liquid staking assets

### Summary

This proposal is to whitelist [Aura Finance](0) in Balancer’s [VotingEscrow](1) contract allowing Aura Finance to lock `BAL` (in the form of [80/20 BAL/WETH BPT](3)), participate in Balancer governance, and provide additional rewards to Balancer ecosystem participants without immediate disposal of `BAL` rewards.

### Abstract

Aura Finance is a protocol built on top of the Balancer system to provide maximum incentives to Balancer LPs and `BAL` stakers through social aggregation of `$BAL` deposits and Aura’s native token `$AURA` .

For BAL stakers, Aura provides a seamless onboarding process to `veBAL` , by creating a tokenised wrapper token called `auraBAL` that represents the 80/20 BPT locked up for the maximum time in VotingEscrow. This can be staked to receive existing rewards ( `$BAL` and `bbaUSD` revenue) from Balancer, in addition to Aura system revenue in the form of `$BAL` , and additional `$AURA` . Users can trade their `auraBAL` back to `BAL` at any time through a deep StablePool BPT.

For Liquidity providers, Aura abstracts away complexity of the Balancer gauge boosting system, providing a smooth onboarding process to all Balancer gauge deposits. Aura allows depositors to achieve a high boost through the protocol owned `veBAL` while also accumulating additional `$AURA` rewards.

`BAL` locked in Aura will be taken out of circulation “Ad vitam æternam”. Being aligned with the DAO is our goal, with this implementation seeking to be fully symbiotic.

### $AURA & Governance

Aura Finance also proposes the `$AURA` token to act as a governance and incentivisation tool within the ecosystem. Locked `AURA` tokens will have governance rights in the system and will be able to vote using the protocol owned `veBAL` voting power. The goal of `$AURA` is to create a flourishing ecosystem on top of Balancer.

***With great power comes great responsibility***... The protocol is expected to control a large stake of the veBAL voting power. This has a huge economic power as it effectively controls the flow of Balancer incentives over the next 20 years. It is therefore important that this control is fully decentralized. Aura has added vote delegation to the system to allow this to take place fully on chain. Once the voter base has sufficiently matured, control will be passed from the starting 4 of 7 multisig, to a suite of on chain contracts.

The Aura Voting contract has support for [EIP1271](4) meaning that the results of on chain votes can be forwarded to [Snapshot](5) to participate in Balancer governance. This transition should take place as soon as the Aura voting contracts are battle tested and the voter base has matured (~3-4 months post launch).

***Amuse Bouche*** - Without giving too much details, here is a quick overview of high level `AURA` distribution:

- 50% Balancer LP rewards Rewarded pro-rata for BAL received on Aura
- 10% for StableSwap auraBAL/BPT over 4 years
- 5% for Aura/ETH incentives

### Team

The Aura team comprises DeFi builders and pioneers with a track record of delivering.

Aura Finance is currently undergoing an audit with Peckshield, and is planning to conduct two further audits with top tier firms.

### Proposal specification

It is proposed that the Balancer multisig add a smart wallet checker on the `veBAL` contract, and subsequently whitelist the depositor contract provided by Aura Finance following a successful proposal. The Balancer team would manually review this contract before whitelisting.

In the interests of keeping Aura 100% fair launch and with no VCs, it is also proposed that the Balancer treasury DAO provide the Aura treasury with a $300k grant in order to reimburse for audit costs and to be spent on further security (e.g. codearena).

**SPEC**

Allowlist the following contract on the veBAL smart_wallet_checker once available: [`0xaf52695e1bb01a16d33d7194c28c42b10e0dbec2`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf52695e1bb01a16d33d7194c28c42b10e0dbec2)

# Proposal:

Approve a “dry powder” allocation of up to $2MM BAL for Tokemak bribe acquisition in connection with BLABS biz dev efforts to grow integrations with Tokemak

## What is Tokemak?

Tokemak can be thought of as a generalized liquidity layer that sits above DEXEs. Users can both LP and direct where the liquidity will go via TOKE voting.

Tokemak has two types of reactors - reactors can just be thought of as a place users can single side stake their assets to earn yield, then the assets are directed via TOKE voters to determine its pair(s). There are pair reactors, those can be thought of as the assets that are generally paired with protocol tokens - being ETH/USDC/DAI/FEI/etc. Then there's the token reactors, which are voted on and added during a ""CoRE'' vote - namely SUSHI/FOX/FXS/etc.

Up to this point TOKE has been distributed via LM incentives for their toke/eth pairs on Uni and Sushi. As well as from staking TOKE to reactors to incentivize Liquidity Direction (and some token swaps).

The ideal future state for Tokemak is most if not all TOKE is being vied for by AMMs/other protocols to direct liquidity towards their token or platform while Tokemak controls a large bag of protocol owned assets that are earning fees and being utilized to stand up other protocols liquidity.

## Summary

Tokemak currently provides options for four different DEXes users can direct their liquidity - Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve and Balancer. Of the four, Balancer is by far the lowest performing. For reference:

* FXS Reactor
  * $514k/$175.2MM directed towards Balancer (0.29%)
* ALCX Reactor
  * $709.80/$32.1MM directed towards Balancer (0.002%)
* FOX Reactor
  * $0/$22.2MM directed towards Balancer (0%)

As of writing this proposal Tokemak controls $905MM worth of assets that TOKE holders are directing to the above mentioned DEXEs. Balancer is currently commanding less than $1MM of that.

Every 5-6 months a new CoRE vote goes live to determine the next round of projects that will launch their own reactors. As of writing this piece this is by far the lowest cost barrier to entry for a CoRE vote to date. The last CoRE vote reached a peak of ~$0.75/vote, [while the highest bribe on Hidden Hand is commanding just ~$0.07/vote](https://hiddenhand.finance/tokemak).

Reactors provide several benefits, namely those being

* Ability to stake a protocol’s assets to farm TOKE, which can then be staked to direct liquidity to Balancer.
* Opens the doors for a token swap with Tokemak to allow Balancer to kickstart Liquidity Directing, currently the best deal on this is FXS where one TOKE can direct up to $114 of FXS
* Makes all future partnerships and integrations infinitely easier due to the Balancer community showing some support for Tokemak
* Pending the launch of the reactor, the reactor could potentially be prewired to deploy to gauges to veBAL and further incentivize a TOKE/ETH 80/20 pool (Liquidity is deployed in cycles). Attracting further liquidity for TOKE/ETH providers away from Sushi/Uni.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

The below Cost-Benefit Analysis assumes 10% TVL utilization at 30 bps and a $4MM token swap is performed with Tokemak. This does not include if any BAL was staked in the Balancer Reactor. The top row shows different scenarios based on a WACC varying from 10%-20% for BAL. As can be seen from the Net Cost Benefit section, this would result in a positive $1.46MM-$1.66M benefit to Balancer, as well as $35.26MM in TVL captured.

||10%|15%|20%|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Bribe Cost|$2.2MM|$2.3MM|$2.4MM|
|Swap Amount|$4MM|$4MM|$4MM|
|TVL Captured|$35.26MM|$35.26MM|$35.26MM|
|Annualized Fee Revenue|$3.86MM|$3.86MM|$3.86MM|
|Net Cost Benefit|$1.66MM|$1.56MM|$1.46MM|

**TVL captured is found by utilizing the info in the FXS reactor, where 1 TOKE = $114 of liquidity available to be directed. 1 Toke = ~$13*

It is also worth noting that TOKE has shown only a 0.14 correlation with ETH while BAL has shown a 0.50 correlation with ETH.[*](https://cryptowat.ch/correlations) This effectively acts as a way for the Balancer Treasury to diversify out of assets directly correlated with ETH while simultaneously providing the benefits listed above.

# Plan of Action

## Tiered Bribe Deployment

The average cost for one TOKE via bribing last CoRE vote was ~$0.75, each TOKE equals six votes. To qualify for a Reactor last CoRE vote, 12 million votes were required. As of writing this proposal only one protocol has deployed any bribes and that is LUNA, who have deployed ~$257K worth of bribes and accrued ~4.4MM votes. This is far less than $0.75/TOKE.

What we propose is instead to send out tiered bribe amounts, starting at $0.35/TOKE and scaling to $1/TOKE utilizing $2MM of BAL to bribe with.

## Reactor Farming + Potential Token Swap + Biz Dev Efforts

As illustrated in the above Cost-Benefit analysis, securing the BAL reactor + token swap would lead to a net gain in all scenarios plus the additional benefit of TVL captured.

We propose that after the bribing period Balancer engages in a Token Swap with Tokemak to seed the initial reactor and allow for Balancer to start directing TVL to it’s platform. Currently the best deal is FXS, however we can deliberate on that post CoRE vote.

This is also part of a holistic discussion that the biz dev team is working on with Tokemak, which includes:

1. Developing default 80/20 pools for deployment on each reactor, which will help differentiate Balancer from other DEXs + raise awareness on their benefits for LPs
2. Working with Tokemak to explore veBAL program as an alt to veCRV on Toke/WETH
3. Discussing boosted pools and stable pools as an option for their exchange assets to increase capital efficiency when retained in the PCV account
4. Balancer reactor as a means to acquire TOKE for Balancer as an LD

BLABS Biz Dev believes that Balancer is in a unique position to compete with LDs globally on Tokemak to acquire TVL for our long term growth. The CBA proves that under conservative assumptions. Tokemak is heavily interested in this as well (for their growth), but finds it even more interesting if it helps bootstrap the flywheel for their involvement in veBAL. There are a number of synergies to be had here with both assets serving as productive for Tokeamk and Balancer.

## Targeted veBAL Education

As a way to dissuade Hidden Hand users from instantly dumping the BAL, run an educational campaign on the value of veBAL. This could come in the form of an AMA with the Tokemak/Redacted communities and/or targeted Twitter Threads.

# Risks

* Bribe is insufficient and BAL used is lost, this is highly unlikely considering the current bribe market and protocols involved. For additional context all Tokemak voters are highly aware of Hidden Hand and utilize it to auto deploy their votes. Most voters have not delegated as they are waiting to see how much will be deployed to Hidden Hand.
* Smart contract risk - Hidden Hand exploited during the bribe period, Tokemak exploited. However this is also highly unlikely and is a necessary risk when deploying funds anywhere in DeFi.
* Risk can also be mitigated by purchasing Insurance cover via InsurAce (https://app.insurace.io/Insurance/BuyCovers)
* Both projects have been audited multiple times ([Tokemak Audits](https://docs.tokemak.xyz/protocol-information/network-security), [Hidden Hand Audits](https://redacted-cartel.gitbook.io/redacted/additional-materials/security-measures))

# Specification

If approved, $2M BAL at the prevailing market price when the vote ends (~155k BAL at time of writing) will be sent from the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` to the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[12782.404336434403, 244593.05545216857]",0

## Abstract

This proposal calls for funding the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/boosted-pools) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol in accordance with the [proposal](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-07-integrate-balancer-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol/3096) put on the 1inch DAO forum.

## Motivation

Balancer Boosted Pools are a tremendous innovation in the AMM space. Many teams and protocols are eager to adapt the Boosted Pools and take advantage of their efficiency for their own unique use cases and needs. The bbaUSD pool currently sits at $350mm.

Boosted Pools have yet to be integrated by the aggregators and as such the liquidity in these pools is not being efficiently utilized by the market. This proposal aims to fund the integration of Boosted Pools in the 1inch aggregator.

Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, BalancerDAO, through this proposal, would fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL (or equivalent in stablecoins) to 1inch Labs.

### Specification

As outlined in the proposal on the [1inch Forum](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-07-integrate-balancer-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol/3096):

1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API.
2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote.
3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs.

The integration of Boosted Pools requires support for linear pools math, order routing and support for BatchSwaps. 1inch’s support for BatchSwaps would generally benefit the Balancer protocol by decreasing the cost of multihop swaps even outside of Boosted Pools.

This grant is contingent on the same proposal passing through the 1inch DAO.

Upon satisfactory integration, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address: 0x2DF104682A61241C79eBB3ce3b2C293578bF6A9D

As outlined on the adjacent proposal, satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user.

## Rationale

The vast majority of trade volume on the Balancer protocol is driven by DEX aggregators. Among the aggregators, 1inch drives a very significant portion of the volume. As such, adoption and integration of Boosted Pools by aggregators is imperative for the success of the Boosted Pools.

I encourage the DAO to ratify this grant and fund the integration of Boosted Pools in the 1inch aggregator.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[191095.01852522697, 1616.0260742381722]",1

### Summary
This is a proposal to hear from the Balancer community about the whitelisting of Tetu contracts for the new product being developed, which is called tetuBAL.

### What is tetuBAL?
tetuBAL is the liquid version of veBAL being developed by Tetu. Each tetuBAL represents veBAL locked forever in a 1:1 ratio.

With tetuBAL users will be able to:

* Deposit 80/20 BAL and ETH on veBAL forever in exchange for tetuBAL.
* Sell tetuBAL for BAL in the liquidity pool.
* Participate in governance votes using dxTETU to target Balancer emissions.
* Exposure to veBAL that is on the Ethereum network with a low cost of gas due to the aggregation of assets.
* veBAL rewards earnings from the maximum 1 year locking period, swap fees, and protocol fees while receiving the boost that is only available on Ethereum.

### Governance
All governance discussions take place through Discord, if there is an implicit community consensus the proposal is carried out and dxTETU holders can vote. Eventually, when the will of the community is unclear, draft proposals are submitted for review and amendment prior to publication of the original proposal.

### Audits and Security
All audits can be found here https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/security/audits

Tetu's security features are 48 hours Time lock and MultiSig Wallet, more information can be seen in the docs. Tetu uses security best practices such as rigorous testing before implementing new code.

# Introduction

Most here likely recognize BeethovenX as the first approved friendly fork of Balancer which began back in October. Over the last six months they’ve proven themselves to be valuable contributors to the Balancer ecosystem - not only by contributing several pull requests to Balancer’s codebase but by exposing thousands of users to the power of Balancer’s technology. They have created and nurtured a vibrant community while building a world class team of operators behind it, from development to marketing to biz dev. 

With the prospect of Optimism launching a token and kicking off what could be an explosive summer of growth the timing is right to establish Balancer as the leading DEX before the gold rush begins. While Balancer Labs could take this on themselves this would mean putting key projects on hold, not to mention that it is far from guaranteed voters would choose to direct BAL emissions to Optimism pools without a financial incentive to do so. 

# Motivation

I propose that BeethovenX takes charge of an official Balancer deployment to Optimism including contract deployment, front end, infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance as required.  This removes any burden on Balancer’s human resources while also creating a strong financial incentive for BeethovenX to attract BAL emissions to Optimism pools. This is accomplished through the 50% protocol fee being split 50/50 between Balancer and BeethovenX. In order to bootstrap adoption and secure Balancer’s position as the leading Optimism DEX, **BeethovenX is allocating up to 3M BEETS for bribing veBAL voters in the first six months.** 

*Any farming by either protocol’s treasury on Optimism is acceptable with the condition that earned BAL rewards are either locked in veBAL or held on the balance sheet. No farming and dumping.* 

This presents a unique opportunity to deepen Balancer’s relationship with BeethovenX, a team which has proven strongly capable of leveraging Balancer technology successfully. As this would be “Balancer on Optimism, by BeethovenX” **veBAL would hold governance power** because we’re plugging into the gauge system. **The governance multisig would have five members, myself plus two Balancer community members and two from BeethovenX**. It’s worth pointing out that BeethovenX has no intention of leaving Fantom - this deal is specifically structured to keep all of their usual emissions on Fantom. They do however recognize the opportunity that exists on Optimism and by acting early we can secure a large share, hopefully the majority share, of the DEX market there. This would be a huge win for both protocols and I would point out that while Balancer has a large treasury to throw at opportunities like this you cannot buy the kind of quality team that BeethovenX brings to the table. 

# Specification

If this vote successfully passes, BeethovenX will begin work on Optimism as soon as possible. They will coordinate with Balancer Labs as required to plug in to the veBAL system. **To be clear, this vote passing would enable veBAL voters to direct BAL emissions to Optimism.** Individual pools would still need to go through the usual gauge approval process. Transaction specifications will be shared with the DAO Multisig as they become available with confirmation of authenticity from at least two independent sources.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[189203.30300957515, 524.8178540450918]",1

## Summary

This proposal aims to whitelist Tracer DAO’s ‘[Treasury Management Fund](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0xec0350ef1040fd328b78fb8dfbda879ed00f1795e78a01089401539f5f77f352)’ (**TMF**) in Balancer’s VotingEscrow contract to allow for the TMF to lock `BAL` (80/20 BAL/ETH) to participate in Balancer’s governance and direction of BAL emissions toward the Balancer ecosystem participants.

## Abstract

[Tracer DAO](https://tracer.finance/) is a decentralised derivatives infrastructure platform that aims to provide a product suite of capital efficient, risk management tools for communities. On behalf of Tracer DAO, we are appreciative of the relationship that has been cultivated with the Balancer community to date, particularly for facilitating the [secondary market liquidity](https://tracer.finance/radar/balancer/) of our ‘Perpetual Pools’ v1 product. To date, this has facilitated a total volume of ~$122.5m in trades.

Tracer DAO is currently working on a ‘v2’ of the Perpetual Pools financial contract which will be approximately launched within the next month. Tracer will continue to utilise Balancer as an ecosystem partner to provide secondary market liquidity.

Tracer DAO’s TMF ([multisig address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95E8C5a56ACc8064311d79946c7Be87a1e90d17f#tokentxns)) currently owns ~$158k staked in the BAL/ETH 80/20 pool on Balancer V2. If this proposal is successful, the TMF will be locking its holdings of BAL to gain access to veBAL to direct rewards toward Perpetual Pools secondary markets on Balancer, as well as towards the [TCR/DAI](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x96ba9025311e2f47b840a1f68ed57a3df1ea8747000200000000000000000160) pool on Balancer.

## Team

The Tracer DAO team team comprises of a globally distributed team ranging from experiences within DeFi, Tradfi and the blockchain data infrastructure layer. Additionally, we are joined by a strong array of [Strategic Partners](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-11-strategic-treasury-diversification/286) and Advisors.

Tracer DAO has partaken in audits from Sigma Prime, Runtime Verification, Spearbit/Secureum, Certik and is planning on conducting further audits with other top tier firms.

## Proposal specification

If this proposal is successful, the Balancer multisig will whitelist the Tracer Treasury Management Fund address (0x95E8C5a56ACc8064311d79946c7Be87a1e90d17f) to be able to lock `BAL` (80/20 BAL/ETH) to participate in Balancers veBAL model. The Balancer team would manually review this contract before whitelisting.

**Introduction**
Whitelist the Aave Companies’ Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock the B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the Aave Companies’ treasury into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

**Motivation**
The Aave Companies are software developers who build open source, blockchain based software, including the Aave Protocol – an open source, decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets.

The Aave Companies have been a long-term user of the Balancer AMM, and currently hold the equivalent of ~252k BAL. This BAL was acquired through early investments and as rewards in exchange for participation in BAL boosted LPs. 

Given this support, the Aave Companies would like to engage in Balancer DAO governance through veBAL. 

**Risks**
The Aave Companies recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

**Specification**

title: [Proposal] Strategic Partnership with Aave DAO
status: Proposed
author: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham
created: 20-04-2022

# Simple Summary

Aave DAO would like to present the Balancer community the opportunity to swap 200,000 BAL for AAVE. The price is to be determined by the 90-day moving average when an AIP is presented for voting via Aave’s governance process, [1].

# Abstract

With a successful Balancer Snapshot vote, an AIP will be presented for the Aave community to vote on. If passed, the contracts will be deployed enabling 200,000 BAL tokens to be deposited and the AAVE held within withdrawn. After the tokens are withdrawn, each community is able to use the newly acquired tokens without restriction.

Aave intends to deposit BAL, with matching ETH, into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool and then deposit the receipt token into the vested escrow contract, locking them for 1 year. The veBAL voting influence is to be used for directing BAL incentives to liquidity pools that create TVL or provide a backstop for Aave markets, [2].

A separate forum post will emerge requesting the Aave Reserve Factor address be added to the Voting Escrow contract whitelist.

# Motivation

Aave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE/ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drives TVL to Aave V2 market, [3]. In time, Aave intends to upgrade the Safety Module from 80/20 AAVE/ETH pool on Balancer V2. There are many more opportunities for both communities to work together and a tokenswap only further strengthens this relationship.

Aave’s veBAL voting influence can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [4]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Bootstrapping these pools benefits both communities and only strengthens the already strong relationship.

By exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. Using data from Etherscan, the tokenswap is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder and for Balancer to become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5,6]. Both communities will have influence in the other’s governance process and be aligned through ownership to collaborate in growing the adoption of both protocols.

The initial sizing of 200,000 BAL was reached by attaining input from some members of the Balancer community. The tokenswap is also the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer DAO token swap, [7]. In addition to the tokenswap outlined here, the Aave community is also considering purchasing an additional 100,000 BAL via a bonding curve on market, [8]. This is a separate proposal and is still in the discussion phase on Aave’s governance forum.

# Implementation

The tokenswap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [9].

Upon withdrawing AAVE from the contract, the Balancer community can deploy the holding without restriction from this proposal.

Both organisations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.

## Introduction

The launch of veBAL has introduced the gauge voting system where veBAL lockers determine BAL emissions by voting for specific pool gauges. A flow has been created on the forum to facilitate approval of new gauges with several votes already passing in just the first three weeks. This proposal aims to streamline this process by delegating the power to add approved gauges to the voting list to the Balancer DAO.

*It is important to make clear that no gauge will be added by BalancerDAO without going through the forum process for approving a new gauge and successfully completing a snapshot vote in favor.*

## Motivation

To alleviate the workload from the DAO Multisig, I am proposing to delegate the power to add approved gauges to this gnosis safe: `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`. This safe already has the power to add new gauges for token rewards other than BAL so it makes sense to keep all gauge activities in the same place. Signers include myself, Mike B, Andrea, Xeonus, Zekraken, Luuk, and Markus who are some of the longest serving and most reliable members of Balancer DAO.

This group of signers will be responsible for ensuring that only approved gauges and gauges which have been correctly set up are added to the voting list. In practice this means the following:

* Ensuring that each forum proposal for a gauge gets adequate attention and that only pools with legitimate tokens are allowed to go for a vote (we don’t want to give BAL emissions to a pool with Uniswap LP tokens or an obvious scam token)
* For L2 gauges, checking that the root gauge has been correctly set up
  * Checking that the root gauge’s recipient getRecipient() is the address of the streamer contract on L2
  * Checking that the L2 gauge contract comes from the L2 factory (factory.isGaugeFromFactory(streamer))
  * Checking that the L2 gauge’s reward_contract is the streamer
  * Checking that the recipient reward_reciever() is a gauge with the LP token matching the pool from the approved vote

## Specification

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling the function `grantRoles` with the following arguments:

**Summary:**
The FIAT DAO community is proposing the following pools be given a veBAL gauge:

* [FDT/ETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x2d344a84bac123660b021eebe4eb6f12ba25fe8600020000000000000000018a)
* *FDT/OHM-ETH-DAI*
* *FIAT/staBAL3*

Note that while the FDT/ETH pool has been set up already by the FIAT DAO community, the other pools, as they are nested pools, require deployment support from the Balancer team which is underway at the time of posting this proposal. 

All pools should be deployed at the time, or shortly thereafter, when voting for this proposal starts ($FIAT launch is imminent). If need be, the two nested pools can be a separate proposal.

**References/Useful links:**

* See [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao) due to forum link restrictions for new members

**Protocol Description:**

The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature.

$FDT is the governance token associated with FIAT DAO. In its current iteration, $FDT confers voting power for users to participate in decision-making around protocol parameters. We are currently underway with an implementation of a v2 specification in which $FDT allows users to gauge behind supported collateral types in order to allocate a protocol backstop and inform algorithmic interest rates. We anticipate that the 80/20 FDT/ETH BPT will be the primary governance power-conferring asset in the updated DAO architecture.


**Motivation:**

FIAT DAO has expressed its desire to become a material player in veBAL governance going forward, as can be seen by a forum discussion accessible via the Linktree above. To achieve this, we are willing to commit DAO funds for the acquisition of voting power and the bribing of existing veBAL participants. For such strategies to have the greatest impact, we are keen to deepen $FDT secondary liquidity. Acquiring a veBAL gauge for the FDT/ETH pool, as well as for the FDT/OHM-ETH-DAI pool, will allow the DAO to move over existing protocol owned liquidity and engage in the Hidden Hand marketplace. As FIAT DAO proves itself a reliable partner to the Balancer ecosystem and the FIAT protocol gets more time in the wild, we hope to be in a position to conduct a DAO token swap at some point in the future as well.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the Security repo within our Github (again, see Linktree).

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each.

5. **Market History:** $FDT has been transferable since November 2021. It has struggled with liquidity due to a removal of liquidity incentives in February 2022 and routing issues on Uni v3 due to an unsupported OHM pairing.

This proposal only covers approval of FDT/WETH 80/20. Gauge: 0xbD0DAe90cb4a0e08f1101929C2A01eB165045660","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[116210.84401245243, 143.8012964041391]",1

Whitelist for veBAL voting:

[OHM-ETH-DAI pool gauge ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xc45d42f801105e861e86658648e3678ad7aa70f900010000000000000000011e)

**References**

[Website] [https://www.olympusdao.finance/ ](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)

**Protocol Description**

Olympus DAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the OHM token. Each OHM token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. UST, DAI, FRAX, wETH) in the Olympus treasury, giving it an intrinsic value. Olympus also introduces novel economic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.

**Motivation**

Recently Olympus DAO seeded a tri-pool with OHM-DAI-wETH with the intention of utilizing the pool for the Olympus Incubator program. The original intention was that protocols can use Copper or PrimeDAO to raise in OHM, bringing volume through Balancer. However, Olympus is now interested in growing the pool further to facilitate a deeper meta pool for prospective partners and to deepen its relationship with Balancer. To this end, Olympus is proposing a BAL gauge for the pool, which will draw additional third party capital and allow Olympus to begin participating in governing the burgeoning Balancer ecosystem.

**Specification**

**Governance:** OlympusDAO is governed by OHM and gOHM token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals.

**Oracles:** No use of oracles within the OlympusDAO protocol.

**Audits:** Same link as above within docs.

**Centralization vectors:** Specific treasury functions are controlled through a multisig, however Olympus has made it a focal point of its mission to work toward full decentralization including the treasury and full on-chain governance. Olympus is currently in discussions with Balancer to be a key component of the shift to on-chain governance.

**Market History:** OHM launched and was made transferable on March 23rd with incentives for users to provide liquidity in exchange for the OHM token. OlympusDAO using the veBAL voting system to boost BAL rewards for its OHM pools along with Olympus ecosystem partners.

This proposal has been developed by the Balancer Foundation Working Group (LuukDAO#5294, Mog#1336, Mkflow#7938, Xeonus#4620, Solarcurve#5075)

**SUMMARY**

Over the last few months, a group of active community members has been evaluating the potential of establishing a Balancer Foundation. After studying ENS, dYdX, PrimeDAO and others we propose the incorporation of the Balancer Foundation. The Balancer Foundation will provide the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

**MOTIVATION**

We believe the formation of the Balancer Foundation is key to furthering the vision of decentralization and creating a robust environment where many groups of people can participate.

Establishing a real world entity that is directed by the DAO provides two primary benefits:

1. It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts – for example, it could establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

2. It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage marketing providers or website creators.

**SPECIFICATION**

This proposal is created to recognize the need for a foundation and acknowledge there will be future proposals for funding this Foundation. The Balancer Foundation will act as an ‘Agent of the DAO’. The Balancer Foundation will be a Cayman Island entity.

**Benefits**

Establishing a Balancer Foundation will directly benefit the DAO by acting as a mechanism for the DAO to:

* direct service providers for major undertakings needed by the DAO
* build resiliency within the DAO and across the broader Balancer Ecosystem
* interact with meatspace engagements as necessary (eg paying subscriptions)

**Foundation Composition**

The Balancer Foundation will be composed of a Board and a CEO for day-to-day operations. The board will be headed by a Supervisor of the Board and board members will be established representatives of the Balancer Ecosystem. The CEO and the Supervisor of the Board are to be located in Cayman.

The following people are proposed to hold these roles:

* [Tristan Relly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-relly-ca-sa-b7a2941/?trk=people-guest_people_search-card): CEO & only staff member
* [Sean Inggs](https://www.ims.ky/our-team): Supervisor of the Board
* Mkflow#7938: Representative of the Balancer DAO, current baller
* Xeonus#4620: Representative of the Balancer DAO, current baller

**ECOSYSTEM FOUNDATION EXAMPLES**

Foundation examples already exist across multiple projects and protocols within the crypto landscape.

Some examples include:

* *dYdX Foundation* - “purpose is to support and grow every aspect, technical or otherwise, of the current implementation and all future implementations of the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol”. Further explanation of the Foundation’s mission can be found [here](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/resources/dydx-foundation).
* *ENS Foundation** - is used as a tool by the DAO to have real-world representation. Description of why ENS thinks this is useful, how the foundation is structured, and what powers the DAO has over the Foundation can be read [here.](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/the-ens-foundation)

***IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE***

* January 2022 - The Balancer Foundation Working Group, composed of LuukDAO#5294, Mog#1336, Mkflow#7938, Xeonus#4620, Solarcurve#5075 has been established to develop this proposal, to review the Articles of Incorporation, and to ensure that the Balancer Foundation is considered and leveraged where appropriate as a mechanism for the DAO. Some examples include reviewing service provider agreements, establishing bookkeeping processes, and completing token diversification agreements when needed.

* April 2022 - Legal incorporation of Balancer Foundation
  * Final approval of the Foundation’s Articles of Incorporation is expected in 1-2 days & will be provided as an attachment on this forum post.

* Q2 2022 - Funding request proposal which defines the budget and operation of the Foundation.

**VOTING**

This proposal will be posted on the forum for a minimum of 5 days prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single-choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting “Yes, let's do it” or “No, this is not the way”.

Voting “Yes, let's do it” on this proposal means:

* You recognize a foundation is needed & acknowledge there will be future proposals for funding.
  * Note that this proposal is not requesting funding.
  * This proposal is acknowledging the need for a Foundation and acknowledges that future proposals will be made for funding.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[103943.09552056434, 2342.7274057843115]",1

# Abstract

As part of the [veBAL tokenomics upgrade](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512) 75% of protocol revenues are to be paid out to veBAL holders in bb-a-USD. An undesirable side effect of this is the protocol liquidating a significant amount of BAL tokens collected as fees. This proposal suggests that these BAL tokens should be paid out to veBAL holders directly on top of the 10% of BAL emissions they receive.

# Motivation

It was noted in the veBAL proposal that there would need to be some consolidation of the tokens collected before paying those fees out to veBAL holders:

""Given Balancer protocol is permissionless and meant to have thousands of pools, fees are going to be collected in potentially thousands of different tokens. Some type of consolidation will be necessary for the fees to be claimable by veBAL holders in a meaningful, gas-efficient way. The fee consolidation prior to distribution will initially be handled by the treasury subDAO, but should be replaced in the near future by a fully decentralized smart contract implementation, akin to Curve’s burner contracts[[12]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html)"" - Fernando


It was decided that protocol fees should be paid out in the bb-a-USD token, however we can see that a significant portion of the protocol fees collected recently were in the form of BAL tokens.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wI4YLCUvIdupofwgSwKDeP-6vYCUdd02WRvkTjgEJgY/edit#gid=0

As we want to incentivise veBAL holders to reinvest into their veBAL position, it's counterproductive to preemptively sell these tokens into stablecoins and it would instead be preferable to pay out BAL directly.

The addition of BAL as a token for which to pay out protocol fees is unique in that 10% of BAL emissions are reserved for veBAL holders and these funds are distributed through the same mechanism as the protocol fees. **It then causes no extra complexity or gas costs for veBAL holders to pay out a portion of the protocol fees in BAL tokens.**

# Specification

- The Treasury subDAO shall exclude any BAL collected from being liquidated to bb-a-USD and use it to supplement the existing BAL emissions paid to veBAL holders.
- Any future tokens collected which are primarily paired against BAL (e.g. auraBAL by way of the 80/20 BPT, etc.) would be liquidated to BAL rather than bb-a-USD.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[132736.1247534562, 0]",1

# Introduction

There are many accomplishments that all contributors to BalancerDAO can be proud of as we look back on the first quarter. These will be detailed throughout this post as we hear the following from each subDAO/working group:

* Budget Accounting
* Successes
* Learnings
* KPI(s) for the second quarter

Key resources:

[Q1 Budget](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/6ac72778504b4d6cad0541b3006e5b45?v=7d4a0ca953b54e5d889ce9fe15ae0a33)

[Q2 Budget](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/73f7fbebc13b4a519d9d1594a2dee96b?v=5f6bffa50bba4ac0b2b944ca1dbe5f5e)

[February Compensation](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/5f9e713ac0c740b5bf57e778afad1599?v=150f8cdf222e4c9cb35a6200d0466159)

[March Compensation](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/6fbcb710d23d4a94bf3f1b8df7311ce2?v=90468971e408439cae22b0dbb6c0baf8)

# Compensation

As we enter the second quarter we will be operating under the [new framework](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xd0d95dadb0537914ad724e95082ebb456cf6ad1aa4eff3915fefc5377caf530c) recently approved through a governance vote. This makes estimating compensation quite difficult as there is a large amount of flexibility built in. As of March, we have 17 contributors on a fixed salary. If we estimate half of them will take the maximum compensation per month in stables ($5,000) and half will take the maximum in max locked veBAL ($10,000 in BAL), we arrive at an estimate of **$127,500 in stables and 21,250 BAL** (at $12 BAL).

It is possible we will have to request supplementary funding from the treasury if this estimate proves to be too conservative but for now we feel it is a reasonably educated guess.

# Ops

## Budget

Ops had two line items on the Q1 Budget - “People Design House (TPDH)” for 300 BAL and “Backup Allocation” for 1000 BAL. TPDH was paid the full 300 BAL in exchange for consulting on onboarding, offboarding, and performance review methods. The “Backup Allocation” was fully exhausted aside from 22 BAL as follows:

50 BAL towards paying for Gitbook (Community Dev working group)
330 BAL to Play Branding Agency (DAO’s share of the rebrand cost, led by Balancer Labs)
598 BAL for sponsoring the DAOist event in Amsterdam in mid April (request of the Marketing subDAO)

Looking ahead to Q2, we estimate the following line items:

**5,000 BAL** - Governance Multisig Stipends (per [this vote](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xadd41023d90e4e66bc1af834f7a3951b7c6171388d24f3779afed4ca9ad75a9e))
**1,200 BAL** - People Design House (300 BAL per month to continue Operation consulting across recruiting, conflict resolution, onboarding strategy and DAO Alumni strategy
**300 BAL** - People Design House payment for March
**12,000 BAL** - Coordinape (4,000 BAL per month)
**1,000 BAL and $20,000 in stables** - Backup Allocation (Conference attendance, ad-hoc DAO expenditures, compensation, other unforeseen costs)

## Successes

* First quarter of Coordinape saw 4,000 BAL over February and March distributed across 19 DAO contributors
* The People Design House (TPDH) executed on contributor accountability and offboarding process design
* Created a Code of Conduct, overhauled compensation, started covering Conference Attendance for contributors (and ensuring funding is included in budget)
* Onboarding process created and v1 implemented
* Executed the first budgeting period (Feb - March), including budget development/spend/reporting

## Learnings

* Ops to increase amount of ‘Backup Allocation’ to account for a wider range of spending occurrences
* More focus on ways to promote a positive work environment and reduce interpersonal conflict
* We now have a clear onboarding process but there is still more work to do to smooth the way for new contributors easily joining the DAO. The insights:
  * New contributors expect the onboarding workflow to be part of their Discord experience.
  * New contributors expect a person to guide them through the DAO. An explainer on how to contribute does not seem sufficient.
  * New contributors do not read all the material on the onboarding section. This means the DAO could find new formats to distribute the information
  * New contributors expect work to be assigned to them at first as they do not have all the context available to make them confident that their idea is what the DAO needs.

## Q2 KPI(s)

* at least 75% positive responses to the monthly health check
* at least 90% active participation on Coordinape (90% of eligible contributors allocate some amount of GIVE)
* Onboarding at least two new contributors who receive some form of compensation
* Developing a clear conflict resolution workflow and upskilling of DAO members

# Grants

## Budget

Grants is requesting an additional allocation of **46,425 BAL** to ensure operations can smoothly continue into Q2.

## Successes

* Approved $421,000 in grants to around 20 grantees
* To continue building out the Balancer ecosystem in a constructive way we wanted to look towards new ways of sourcing quality applications. Wave 3 was only 2 months long (to get in line with the rest of the subDAO cycles), but quite some work has been done on this front.

Inhouse comparative research has brought up potential leads for promising grantees.

A grant is live in which research is being done into how the program could manifest itself more effectively in the right circles. Finding more use cases and projects who would benefit from building on top of Balancer V2.

Balancer grants is about to work together with a well known DAO to collaborate on grants! This will bring in a lot more applications for our program. Details will be announced soon.

Talks with an accelerator are happening as well. If successful, this would help our grantees in growing and bringing bigger and better value to the Balancer ecosystem. Plus it would be yet another funnel bringing in more qualified and relevant leads for the Balancer grants program.

## Learnings

* We have (sadly) had to implement some structure around stale grantees. Going into the 4th Wave it is clear that some grants do not complete. This was always expected to happen and to be honest, we feel quite relieved it only happened after 8 months. And only with two smaller grantees out of 25 grantees in total!

If a grantee has ignored committee messages for 6 weeks, we consider the grant stale. To make sure we do not have endless clutter within our pipeline, this would be the moment to take it out of our projected budget and weekly/monthly updates.

## Q2 KPI(s)

Hard to do with Grants, however, we pledge to deliver a Final Report with data and learnings, both internal and from feedback of the grantees plus share our success rate of grantees.

# Partnerships

## Budget

Partnerships had two line items for Q1 - 415 BAL for two potential Junior Biz Dev hires and 250 BAL for Misc expenses. Only 100 BAL was paid to Cosme Fulanito for some analysis work on Liquidity Mining. For Q2, Partnerships is not requesting any additional budget beyond compensation.

## Successes

* Yearly Partnership with BanklessDAO through LM program, which is meant to leverage the high user base for marketing and general visibility (State of the DAO newsletter) (Q2 will focus around veBAL)
* Curated Overnight’s USD+ on Polygon boosted pool (still on the final development phase)
* Won over the strong QuickSwap & Sushi competition for Matic liquid staking on Polygon; projected liquidity over 200M$
* Curated, brought to the Community and finally approved the Hexagon Dex on Avalanche.
* Built the “partnership Flowchart” accessible [here](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Partnership-Flow-Chart-b876940a22824a3aacf656088146f812).
* Developed the Balancer Friendly Fork Framework

### Liquidity Mining Committee

* Increased general efficiency for LM distribution;
* Strategic Partners are now connected through Partnership;
* Introduced the “90 days incentive program”
* Introduced the “Rising Star” program
* Introduced a new Standard Operating Procedure for double incentives programs (Multisig wallet seeding)
* “Cosme Fulanito” produced a weekly report for LM efficiency;

## Learnings

We initially requested two interns dedicated to the subDAO, ideally these roles were supposed to alleviate some workload on the Team. Existing Ballers partially covered these roles well at the start but lack of structure/process reduced the ability of tasks to be easily delegated to these new members of the subDAO. Their time was therefore absorbed by existing roles within the DAO. Dedicated partnership members are therefore the preferred path forward.

## Q2 KPI(s)

* Create a full budget for new team
* Hire 2 x Junior Biz Devs

## Plan for Q2

* Taking care and maintaining existing DAO partnerships, LM engagements and launched FF, through the hiring of 2 x Junior Biz Dev
* Defining, curating and hiring a DAO integrations/ technical BD
* Sync up and collaborate with Balancer ecosystem team ( Blabs, GEC,Foundation)
* Idea of continuing to focus on “Ecosystem”
* Deepen some existing relationships
* Hoping for Core Dev Team to deliver “Managed Pools” so to explore good partnership with leading Index teams in the DeFi ecosystem and consider an inhouse product called “Balancer Indexes”
* Focus on the creation of the “Balancer DAO dApp”: this, in principle, would see the collaboration of Partnership subDAO and Dev subDAO.

# Treasury

## Budget

There was no budget requested for Q1 and no budget requested for Q2, outside of compensation.

## Successes

* Passed the Fei Trubo proposal, collaborated with Fei on a BPT Fuse pool (borrowing against BPT’s)
* Coordinating with Messari for the quarterly report
* Created revenue projections and balance sheet in a google spreadsheet (zekraken)
* Passed the proposal to invest protocol fees for the DAO

## Learnings:

* Planning was underway for work on the quarterly financial report, then the Messari proposal went to a vote and passed. This forced a change of plans and caused some work to be wasted.
* Didn’t focus enough on process creation - most decisions today are made ad-hoc

## Q2 KPI(s)

* Flesh out an investment framework for the DAO’s assets (how to measure risk appetite)
  * Return benchmarks
  * Use Balancer and/or external protocols
  * Build out processes around how these decisions are made

# Marketing

## Budget

For Q1 500 BAL was allocated towards a “Community Video Competition”. Of this, 364 BAL has been paid out.

For Q2 a total budget of $24,000 in stablecoins is being requested for the following:

* $5,000 for Spaghetti.eth in Milan
* $10,000 for another round of bounties/competitions
* $3,000 for sponsored articles in Chinese crypto media
* $6,000 for miscellaneous campaigns

## Successes

* started our first campaign with video bounties
* more structured workflow and plans within the marketing subDAO

## Learnings

We have learned that in general we always achieve better results when our comms is clear and tidy - in particular:

* We need to push more campaigns and diversify, and be more ordered in what we publish (e.g. coordinating with Blabs)
* We need to find a one-place for communicating with the public as BalancerDAO (could be Twitter or one Discord chat)

## Q2 KPI(s)

* Sponsor at least 2 relevant physical crypto events in Q2.
* Hold at least 5 AMAs per month during Q2.
* Grow the Balancer DAO account to 5k followers by the end of Q2.
* Aim for 3 submissions per Balancer Bounties

## Plan for Q2

The goal is to improve the BalancerDAO brand awareness and our voice in general.

In the next quarter we will focus on:

* putting more order in everything we do and plan and be more transparent with the ballers and community
* make new campaigns (maybe on Twitter too),
* Look at reward based NFTs/POAPs for on chain metrics and social media involvement.
* Continue Pools of the Week posts, and new pool live.
* Continue progressing with veBAL campaign with more informative tweets and highlighting projects utilizing.
* Establish #BALbattles
* Look at incorporating Youtube video into Notion, Medium articles and other posts where possible.
* be more active and involved in IRL events (not just sponsoring but also having ballers there)

# Community Dev

## Budget

There was a budget of $300 per month to pay for a community gitbooks account. This will be extended through Q2 for a total ask of $900 for Q2.

## Successes

* Onboarding of new Baller Zen Dragon
* Launch of community docs https://balancer-dao.gitbook.io/learn-about-balancer/
* Great progress on balancer.tools v2: https://balancer-tools.web.app/
* Multi-chain support for Balancer Analytics: https://balancer-v2-info.web.app/#/
* Deployment of community subgraphs!

## Learnings

* Dev time always takes longer than expected
* Writing good and comprehensive documentation is time-consuming

## Q2 KPI(s)

* Launch info.balancer.fi (analytics) - with support for mainnet, Arbitrum and Polygon
* Launch balancer.tools v2
* Write first community developer documentation on our DAO gitbooks
* Maintain, expand, and support further development of documentation as new technologies are implemented. - Couple these with the marketing subDAO’s focuses
  * Examples: veBAL, boosted pools, managed pools, fuse / turbo etc.

# Conclusion

In total, BalancerDAO is requesting:

* $127,500 in stables and 21,250 BAL for Compensation
* $44,900 in stables and 65,925 BAL for budgets outside of Compensation
  * 46,425 BAL out of 65,925 BAL is for Grants

There is ~500 BAL remaining from the unspent Q1 budget.

Thus, the following transactions will be initiated from the DAO Multisig if this vote is approved:

* A transfer of **46,425 BAL** to the Grants Multisig at 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597
* A transfer of ($127,500 + $44,900) = **$172,400 of bbaUSD** to the Ops Multisig at 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325
* A transfer of (21,250 + 65,925 - 46425 - 500) = **40,250 BAL** to the Ops Multisig at 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[109127.2150951567, 0]",1

• Twitter: https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO
• Discord: [Discord](discord.gg/badgerdao)

**Protocol Description:**

**BADGER Protocol**

BadgerDAO is a well established DAO which seeks to build the infrastructure for Bitcoin in DeFi. We make it easy to bridge your Bitcoin into other blockchains and start earning yield right away. Badger Vaults currently have over $700m in TVL as well as launched ibBTC which is the number 5 Bitcoin synthetic in defi. BADGER is the governance token of BadgerDAO which allows for users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO as well as be held to receive boosted emissions on your deposits within the Badger Vaults ecosystem. We have paired BADGER with wBTC which is the largest Bitcoin synthetic and has well established security.

**Price History $BADGER**

Price History for BADGER can be found on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/badger-dao)

**Motivation:**

The [BADGER/wBTC 80/20 Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xb460daa847c45f1c4a41cb05bfb3b51c92e41b36000200000000000000000194) needs incentivization to migrate meaningful amounts of liquidity over to the Balancer ecosystem. We’re interested in having a diverse set of exchanges which support the BADGER token liquidity and giving Badger supporters many opportunities to earn fees and yield on their tokens.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:**

BadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts that handle operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail in the repo linked below:
[Badger Multisigs](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/)

The highest risk operations are controlled by a timelock address which needs to be triggered and has a 2 day time delay to perform any actions.

2. **Oracles:**

Badger does not rely on any external oracles

3. **Audits:**

Audits have been performed by multiple top tier audit agencies. Web2 has been fully audited and reviewed by Halborn and we have an ongoing relationship with Quantstamp and code4rena. Badger Audits can be found on badger.com here: https://badger.com/security-and-audits

4. **Centralization vectors:**

Badger does utilize upgradeable contracts for many of the products we offer, though these are protected by a 2 day timelock for prevention of issues. Our API and frontend are hosted by centralized entities but we are releasing an IPFS hosted access point titled “Chadger” for people to utilize that is fully permissionless.

5. **Market History:**

Badger has been actively trading since December 2020. There have been typical ebbs and flows in terms of valuation but no severe price issues. The Balancer pool has only recently been launched and has not received volume to give any insights. Comparable pairs have had >$1m daily average volume during this time across univ2/3+sushi which can bring consistent volume and fees to Balancer.

# Introduction

Allow the Tribe DAO to vote-lock the BAL owned by their protocol into veBAL, and participate in governance on the Balancer DAO.

# Motivation

The Tribe DAO currently holds the equivalent of ~270k BAL, which could be used in Balancer’s governance (see [FIP-92](https://snapshot.org/#/fei.eth/proposal/0x1a3c863f58b7ecf2d46e12e28c8a93e9d4535295bc1a1b10a61b96d8ce7927c7) vote). This BAL comes partly from the [treasury swap](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x7972e1700ac30495ad936038b66055b1e6420c3de5ed1fec963abe5faa2d16a3) performed with the Balancer DAO in November 2021, and partly from BAL rewards earned in the liquidity mining program since then.

The Tribe DAO has a privileged relationship with the Balancer DAO ([Turbo](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xa3548202efb91c59c40586d0cd3e71655529edef196d814bff145cf1cc0fcbf1), Buybacks, Fuse Pool, and more to come), and vote-locking the protocol’s BAL seems like a logical next step.

# Risks

The smart-contract used to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH into veBAL is immutable, and does not tokenize the deposits. It doesn’t do anything that an externally-owned account couldn’t do. Therefore, the risks are minimal.

The contract is deployed on mainnet and its source code can be consulted here : https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2

# Introduction

On Monday afternoon, during a knowledge-sharing session between Balancer Labs's engineers, we realized that the veCRV smart contracts that form the basis of the veBAL system operate differently from our initial expectations.

No user funds are at stake, nor is any immediate action from Liquidity Providers required. The veBAL contract also remains safe and will continue to allow current and future holders to vote on the allocation of weekly BAL emissions for Balancer pools.

Our initial understanding was that the gauge type weights (`_get_type_weight`) in the Gauge Controller contract would allow us to implement classes of gauges, such that the share of emissions directed to each class (a ""gauge type"") would be controlled by Balancer governance (see the Gauge types section of the veBAL Tokenomics proposal[[1]](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a)).

The intended outcome was for BAL emissions to be allocated as follows:

* 10% to veBAL holders
* 56% to Ethereum Pools
* 7% to Arbitrum Pools
* 17% to Polygon Pools
* 10% to the Liquidity Mining Committee, for partnerships

veBAL holders would then vote on-chain on how to distribute the 56/17/7% allocations among Liquidity Pools in those networks.

In reality, such implementation is not possible in the original veCRV system. Implementing this would require substantially changing the system, reducing compatibility with apps built on top of Curve's ecosystem - one of the key expected benefits outlined in the veBAL proposal.

What this means for the veBAL system as currently deployed is that:

1. mainnet gauges have been minting ~100% of weekly emissions instead of 56%; and
2. contrary to our original intent/expectations, no other gauges will be able to mint any significant amounts of BAL on April 14th.

We'll be conducting a thorough post-mortem to identify what we could have done differently, and make changes to our internal processes so as to prevent this from happening again. In the meantime, the Balancer community must now make a decision.

# Specification

This proposal provides two options below for how governance can proceed. In both options the LM committee is proposed to be eliminated as everyone showed support for this (even the LM committee itself). 

## Option 1: keep the system as it is

This means that through the on-chain gauge voting mechanism, veBAL holders have full control over the allocation of weekly BAL emissions. Gauges would be created so that veBAL holders would be able to direct incentives to themselves (that is, to all veBAL holders) or to pools on Polygon and Arbitrum, in addition to the existing gauges on Ethereum mainnet.

A 10% cap would be imposed on weekly emissions to veBAL holders, with any excess being sent to the Balancer DAO treasury.

### Pros:

* No redeployment or migration necessary: LPs wouldn't have to take any action.
* The system would become more similar to Curve's, which has no weekly allocation to veCRV holders. Balancer would still have this options available, but the amount would be defined directly by veBAL voting (up to the 10% cap) instead of being fixed at 10% as initially proposed.

### Cons / Risks:

* The original fixed weight distribution to veBAL holders won't be possible. It will still be possible to achieve this through veBAL votes, but the outcome would no longer be predictable. The veBAL gauge may get less than 10% of the votes, leading to fewer tokens being allocated to veBAL holders, or more than 10%, reducing the size of liquidity incentives for Pools (funding the DAO treasury in the process).

## Option 2: deploy a new version of the gauge system

This is the closest we can get to a system that behaves as described in the veBAL proposal without significant changes to the veCRV system.

1. The current BAL Minter contract would have its minting permission revoked.
2. Three new BAL Minter contracts would be deployed, enforcing that 10% of emissions are allocated to veBAL holders, and 90% are controlled by veBAL holders through the on-chain gauge voting mechanism.
3. A new GaugeController and a new GaugeFactory for mainnet pools would be deployed.
4. The existing veBAL contract would have voting power over this new GaugeController: no migration is needed on the part of veBAL holders.

It would still not be possible to implement the 56/17/7% split between mainnet/Polygon/Arbitrum as outlined in the veBAL proposal. The distribution across the 3 networks (and any additional network Balancer may be deployed to in the future) will be fully defined by veBAL voting power (this is also true in option 1).

### Pros:

* The original fixed allocation to veBAL holders in the veBAL proposal would be achieved: veBAL holders would get 10% of weekly emissions.

### Cons / Risks:

* This will require a migration of staking positions. New gauges would be deployed on mainnet to replace the existing ones. Liquidity providers would be required to unstake from the current gauges and stake into the new ones in order to continue to receive incentives (as part of this proposal, the Balancer treasury would reimburse the gas costs of these operations).
Liquidity providers that don’t migrate before a transition period finishes would not get BAL until they do so.
* Current votes would be lost and veBAL holders would have to recast their votes to mainnet gauges (the impact of this could be low, assuming most would recast anyway when L2 gauges were to be released).
* The gauge for the wstETH/WETH pool is also receiving LDO on top of BAL from the veBAL program. As LPs unstake from this gauge to stake in the new one, they would lose any potential LDO for the remainder of the week.

An airdrop of BAL through a Merkle Orchard (the legacy LM distribution system) would happen for those who did not claim their BAL from LM in the current system before the migration, along with a reimbursement for migration gas costs. LPs that migrate to the new gauges will be accounted for as if they had not unstaked from the current gauges.

## Implementation

The governance multisig needs to call the authorizer[[2]](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa331d84ec860bf466b4cdccfb4ac09a1b43f3ae6#code) with the following inputs: `authorizer.grantRole(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, coordinator)` , which means it will grant full admin powers to the coordinator smart contract.

Since the coordinator hasn’t been deployed yet, its address is not known. However, the Balancer community will be able to verify the coordinator address by that date on Balancer’s github in the deployment output folder[[3]](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220418-veBAL-gauge-fix-coordinator/output/mainnet.json). This link will point to a json file with entry `veBALGaugeFixCoordinator` followed by the coordinator’s address on mainnet:
`{   veBALGaugeFixCoordinator: 0xabced...., }`

After applying the necessary changes voted, the coordinator will renounce all given permissions and will not be usable anymore.

## Coordinator Actions

The actions to be performed by the coordinator depend on the option chosen by the community.

### Option 1

The coordinator will mint the missing 98.6k BAL meant for veBAL holders, as well as Polygon and Arbitrum LPs. These tokens will be sent to the recipient contracts of the gauges, resulting in the same outcome as if the gauges had minted the tokens.

Then, the gauge type weights for all types will be set to the same value, making votes for all gauge types have the same relative weight. veBAL holders will need to vote for the veBAL gauge in order for it to receive tokens.

The coordinator will also set the gauge type weight for the Liquidity Mining Commmittee type to 0 and kill the gauge.

### Option 2

The coordinator will mint the missing 98.6k BAL meant for veBAL holders, as well as Polygon and Arbitrum LPs. These tokens will be sent to the recipient contracts of the gauges, resulting in the same outcome as if the gauges had minted the tokens. 

Additionally, it will mint all unminted BAL tokens that correspond to L1 LPs in order to airdrop them as part of the migration. Then, it will revoke minting permission from the current Balancer Minter contract, effectively disabling the Liquidity Mining program in its current configuration and preventing any further minting from the existing gauges.

With the old minter contract disabled, it will grant minting permissions to three new contracts: one that will always mint 10% of weekly emissions for veBAL holders, one that will always mint 10% of weekly emissions for the Liquidity Mining Committee (unless the community decides to not continue with this initiative), and one that will distribute the remaining percentage to liquidity gauges. A new GaugeController will be connected to this minter, meaning veBAL holders will need to recast their votes, and new liquidity gauges will in turn be connected to the GaugeController, meaning LPs will need to unstake from the old gauges and stake in the new one (this gas cost would be later reimbursed).

The coordinator will also set the gauge type weight for the Liquidity Mining Commmittee type to 0 and kill the gauge.

## Keeping promises

Liquidity providers on Polygon and Arbitrum have been expecting to receive 24650 BAL and 10150 BAL per week for liquidity provided between April 4 and April 17. Similarly, veBAL holders have been expecting 14500 BAL per week starting on April 7.

Until this proposal has been discussed and voted on, those amounts would be honored. Governance would mint 98.6k BAL to be retroactively distributed to veBAL holders and liquidity providers on Polygon and Arbitrum, covering the period between April 4th and April 21st.

No minting would be required to cover the Liquidity Mining Committee's share of emissions for the week between April 7 and April 13, as no commitments were made regarding distributions for that week. If needed, 14.5k BAL could be minted if there's a need to allocate BAL through the committee for the week between April 14 and April 20, but given that a gauge migration is one of the possible outcomes of this proposal it would be best to avoid allocating additional reward tokens to the existing gauges.

# Summary

Notional proposes to add a veBAL gauge for the [NOTE/WETH 80/20 pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x5122e01d819e58bb2e22528c0d68d310f0aa6fd7000200000000000000000163), Notional’s staked NOTE Balancer pool.

The incentivization of the 80/20 pool would:

* Help deepen NOTE liquidity on Balancer;
* Reinforce Balancer’s position as the prime DEX to trade NOTE tokens;
* Encourage NOTE token holders to stake their NOTE in the 80/20 sNOTE pool.

Notional v2 launched in November 2021 and has since then facilitated more than $450M in fCash trading volume to become the leading player in fixed rates lending and borrowing on Ethereum.

The Notional protocol is governed by NOTE token holders. The NOTE price history can be viewed on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/notional-finance)

# Motivation

This proposal seeks to add a veBAL gauge for the NOTE/WETH 80/20 pool. BAL incentives would help deepen NOTE liquidity, attract more capital to Notional’s staking module, and increase NOTE trading volume on Balancer.

# Specification

## Governance

The Notional protocol is governed by NOTE token holders. NOTE token holders can vote on governance proposals (governance parameter changes, adding new modules etc.) through Notional’s [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/notional.eth).

The [Notional forum ](https://commonwealth.im/notional)is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.

It is worth noting that an [admin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x22341fB5D92D3d801144aA5A925F401A91418A05#readProxyContract
) controls certain portions of the protocol. 
## Oracles

Notional relies on chainlink oracles to assess if an account is sufficiently capitalized. More specifically Notional relies on the following oracles:

* [ETH/DAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6085b0a8f4c7ffa2e8ca578037792d6535d1e29b)
* [ETH/USDC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x68225f47813af66f186b3714ffe6a91850bc76b4)
* [ETH/WBTC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10aae34011c256a9e63ab5ac50154c2539c0f51d)

## Audits:

Notional’s smart contracts have undergone multiple audits and are subject to a bug bounty program:

* [ABDK audit](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/master/audits/ABDK%20-%20Notional%20V2%2C%20Sept%201%202021.pdf);
* [Certora formal verification](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/master/audits/Certora%20-%20Formal%20Verfication%20Report%2C%20Nov%201%202021.pdf);
* [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-08-notional);
* [Immunefi $1M bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/notional/)
* Consensys audit

## Centralization vectors

Notional’s governance mechanisms are still in the early stages of decentralizing. At the moment, key portions of the protocol are governed by a 3 of 5 multisig where all signatories are fully doxxed. The multisig’s admin powers are intended to be phased out and it is something the team is actively working towards.

As a side note, Notional liquidations can be performed by anyone as the flash liquidation contract is open-source.

## Market history

### NOTE

The NOTE token has been trading on Balancer via the NOTE/WETH 50/50 pool since mid-November 2021. Over that time period, the Balancer NOTE/WETH 50/50 pool facilitated over $75M in trading volume. Following its listing, the NOTE token price was highly volatile reaching an all-time high of $22. Over time and as liquidity improved, the NOTE token price has proven to be less volatile, although it would still highly benefit from deeper liquidity.

### sNOTE

On April 4th, Notional launched staked NOTE (sNOTE). When a user stakes his NOTE tokens they are converted to 80/20 NOTE/ETH Balancer LP tokens. The 80/20 balancer pool allows users to stake with 100% of NOTE tokens, proportional shares of NOTE and ETH, or 100% ETH to buy NOTE and stake all at once. As sNOTE holders earn rewards from buybacks, sNOTE tokens become redeemable for an ever-increasing number of Balancer LP tokens.

As of April 8th, the NOTE/WETH 80/20 pool already attracted **$4M in TVL and $800K in trading volume**. Let’s note that most of the liquidity previously sitting in the NOTE/WETH 50/50 pool has already migrated to the new sNOTE 80/20 pool making the 80/20 pool a prime candidate for a Balancer veBAL Gauge.

## Protocol Description
CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.

## Motivation
Strengthen the COW and BAL communities ties by giving a reward in COW tokens for veBAL voters, while increasing BAL rewards to COW liquidity providers. More in CowDAO proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783)

### Summary

DAOhaus proposes to add a veBAL guage for the [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool] `https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159)`

### Protocol Description

[$HAUS]`https://daohaus.club/token` is the governance token for DAOhaus.

DAOhaus is a home for purpose-driven community DAOs. The DAOhaus platform is a human-friendly interface for communities to collectively deploy and manage [Moloch DAOs] `https:// medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455` Over 2,000 DAOs have been summoned on the DAOhaus platform to date, with over 10,000 individual DAO members and millions of dollars worth of crypto assets secured in DAO treasuries.

#### Governance: UberHaus and Warcamp

DAOhaus is governed by [UberHaus]`https://uberhaus.club/`, a DAO whose members are themselves DAOs that use the DAOhaus platform. UberHaus’ powers include governing the non-circulating $HAUS supply.

Uberhaus delegates (appointed by each DAO according to their own processes) meet weekly to discuss Uberhaus business. Proposals are made with a 4 day voting period and a 14 day ""grace period"" during which member DAOs can exercise their right to  ""ragequit"", i.e., exit the DAO with their full share of the treasury. This credible threat of exit creates a robust balance of power within the DAO and incentivizes seeking consensus whenever possible.

UberHaus funds one of its member DAOs – Warcamp – to build, maintain, and promote the DAOhaus platform. All core contributors to DAOhaus are members of, and receive compensation from, the Warcamp DAO. Warcamp members are admins of the DAOhaus Github repos.

##### Relevant links:

* The [UberHaus DAO]`https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x4bec8e49aa44bb520bd5e29d6358e22464b5eb68` (on Gnosis Chain), which includes the main treasury and non-circulating $HAUS supply
* The [Warcamp DAO]`https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1` (on Gnosis Chain)
* The [UberHaus delegate multisig]`https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x648DfEBbaf3638cDa047141dbF4AF3006e880f49` (on Ethereum; 6 of 11), via which a set of delegates from UberHaus and Warcamp manage UberHaus’ assets on Ethereum. Those assets include a portion of the HAUS/WETH Balancer pool liquidity.

#### $HAUS Price History

The majority of the $HAUS price history is viewable [on Coingecko]`https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/daohaus`.

March 29, 2021, was the first time there was publicly available $HAUS liquidity. The initial price at that point was $8.88. There was an immediate runup just prior to Coingecko beginning to track the price.
___
### Motivation

The [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool]`https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159` needs incentivization to help maintain and deepen its liquidity, which would have a number of important benefits, including the following.

* Enabling easier access to $HAUS for DAOs and individuals wishing to participate in DAOhaus governance activities
* Facilitating DAOhaus ecosystem grants denominated in $HAUS (by increasing the relative stability of the $HAUS price)
* Facilitating upcoming utilization of $HAUS as a coordination mechanism (beyond voting) within the DAOhaus ecosystem (also related to price stability)
* Supporting the utility and value of DAOhaus contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS
____
### Specifications

#### Governance:

See Governance section under Protocol Description above.

#### Oracles:

The DAOhaus platform does not rely on any external oracles.

#### Audits:

The most used smart contracts in the DAOhaus platform are instances of the [MolochV2.1 contract framework]`https://github.com/HausDAO/Molochv2.1`. V2.1 makes only a small adjustment to the [V2 contract]`https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch`, which was audited by Consenys Diligence.

None of the contracts used within the DAOhaus platform are upgradable.

DAOhaus also makes use of Minion contracts, which allow a DAO to interact with external contracts and control external vaults. The predominant version is the [Safe Minion contract]`https://github.com/HausDAO/MinionSummonerV2`, which acts as middleware between the DAO contract and a Gnosis Safe, where all the funds are stored and external contract interactions are executed.

There have been no hacks of DAOhaus smart contracts to date.

* [MolochV2 audit report]`https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/01/the-lao/` by Consensys Diligence

#### Centralization vectors:

DAOhaus takes decentralization seriously and has made several organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. As a result, the current state of DAOhaus is reasonably decentralized:

* None of the DAOhaus contracts are upgradable.
* Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed across multiple entities, each of which is a DAO of its own. For example, DAOhaus core contributors (Warcamp) is a 30-person DAO with distributed governance powers.
* Non-circulating $HAUS is controlled by UberHaus, the DAO of DAOs. No DAO in UberHaus controls more than 10.5% of voting shares, and there is no path by which a DAO could gain additional voting shares without permission from a majority of peer DAOs.

The largest centralization vector is our front end hosting, over which a handful of developers have admin control. However, while an attack on the front end could manipulate what users see, the on-chain contracts (readable and writable via block explorers) remain the source of truth for all key user assets.

Our goal is to migrate our entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

#### Market History:

The pool has been active since March 8, 2022.

* Current TVL: $2.1M
* Historical volume: $248k

This proposal aims to authorize an updated version of the Batch Relayer which adds (un)wrapping capabilities for [ERC-4626 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) and [UnbuttonTokens](https://github.com/buttonwood-protocol/button-wrappers/blob/main/contracts/UnbuttonToken.sol#L18). For reference, the [original Batch Relayer](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xedff802a4ffb1ba0e131c7d4126fa669648a9333860a74de57c9e5971b9ec541) enabled atomic sequences of `swaps`, `joins`, and `exits`, as well as (un)wrapping of stETH and Aave aTokens. Batch Relayer V2 retains all of those features from V1.

This proposal seeks authorization for Batch Relayer V2 **only on Polygon**, as it is anticipated that a Batch Relayer V3 will soon be available on all networks. This intermediate release is targeted specifically at a new USD+ Boosted Pool on Polygon.

The relayer would be granted authority to perform the following tasks on behalf of users **who have opted into using it**:

* Leverage the user’s existing Vault allowances and internal balances to avoid duplicate approvals.
* Swap on the user’s behalf.
* Add and remove liquidity on the user’s behalf.

## Motivation

The team at [Overnight](https://overnight.fi/), who created the USD+ yield-bearing stable coin, played a significant role in the development of the new [`ERC4626LinearPool`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-linear/contracts/erc4626/ERC4626LinearPool.sol). This pool supports tokens implementing the recently finalized [EIP-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626), and the Balancer Integrations Team believes it has the potential to open up Boosted Pools to a plethora of yield-bearing tokens. We thank Overnight for their patience throughout the integrations process and would like to add relayer support for their new pool as soon as possible.

The relayer will enable trades involving the rebasing USD+ which is incompatible with the Balancer Vault. It does this by (un)wrapping from/to the StaticUsdPlus token, which is an ERC-4626 token wrapper that removes the rebasing component. This will effectively create direct markets for USD+ on Balancer, not only via DAI, USDC, and USDT, but also via multihop to any other connected token within the Vault. For example, the relayer would enable the following atomic DAI->USD+ trade:

1. perform a multihop batch swap from DAI to StaticUsdPlus through the USD+ Boosted Pool;
2. unwrap the StaticUsdPlus tokens from step 1, receiving plain USD+ tokens;

## Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the `BalancerRelayer` contract. Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message.

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions, and it has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the Balancer Labs team.

The addresses of the `BalancerRelayer` and `BatchRelayerLibrary` mentioned in this proposal can be found in the [official repo](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/pull/1182/commits/cc113a4aaa9f3869a5accfdf236eafd6528a74d2).

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig **on Polygon** would submit a transaction to the `Authorizer` in order to grant the following roles to the `BalancerRelayer`:

1. `manageUserBalance` : Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to re-approve the new relayer for each token.
2. `joinPool` : Add liquidity to a pool on the user’s behalf.
3. `exitPool` : Remove liquidity from a pool on the user’s behalf.
4. `swap` : Trade within a single pool on the user’s behalf.
5. `batchSwap` : Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools.
6. `setRelayerApproval` : Approve the relayer on the user’s behalf (user must still provide a signed message).

The Gnosis Safe at `0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80` would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following data to authorize the BalancerRelayer at `0xF537dDd7f4cc72C6C08866b62EAe9378f1F62da8`:

# Motivation

For the last year, swap fees on the Balancer protocol have been controlled by Gauntlet [[1]](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-partners-with-gauntlet-to-make-dynamic-fee-pools-a-reality-97b3fb1760df). Gauntlet aims to quantitatively and algorithmically find the best swap fee configuration for a given pool and market conditions [[2]](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/balancer-v2-pools-trading-fee-methodology-7a65df671b8c). As the partnership is due for renewal February 17th the DAO is proposing to take over ownership, ultimately terminating the contract with Gauntlet.The DAO has analysed the situation and found several issues in favour of stopping Gauntlet swap fee control. Gauntlet has signalled that they will “sunset the Fee Optimization Product” and want to hand over the swap fee controller, therefore agreeing with our intention of transitioning control to the DAO.

To summarise the situation from the Balancer DAOs perspective, following issues led to the termination of the partnership:

* Gauntlet uses closed-source code - this is against the open-source spirit of Balancer
* We would expect a high cost of about 10-15k BAL per year to use their product
* The protocol swap fees have never really been algorithmically controlled but rather changes have been made with some sort of “unknown” methodology
* Manual intervention was needed
* Adjusting intervals were weeks, not days or hours - inacceptable for a system that has to react fast to market conditions

Based on these factors we propose to take over ownership of swap fee control to the treasury subDAO. We propose a multi-phase transition (see specifications) to achieve a fully automated system that anybody can contribute to.

# Risk assessment/mitigation

We anticipate minimal to no risk in handing over the swap fee control to the DAO. The multi-phase plan will guarantee that a reasonable swap fee control mechanism will be in place at some point. For the first iteration, the treasury subDAO will take ownership of a multisig setting swap fees. Even “harmful” configurations could be easily undone and assets would always stay safe.

Gas costs will be covered by the treasury funds. We do not expect high costs as these are non-complex operations on the swap fee controller.*emphasized text*

# Specification

## Phase 1: handing over fee control to DAO

In the first phase the subDAO takes over control of swap fee settings for all pools. The first iteration will manage pools manually. For simplicity, the fees will be tier-structured as follows:

### Tier system

|Tier|Pool type|Fee range|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|Stable pools|<=0.01%|
|2|Standard and index pairs|<=0.1%|
|3|Ecosystem pairs (e.g. BAL/WETH 80/20)|>1% and <= 5%|
|4|Experimental pairs (e.g. hot coins)|>5%|

Explanation on the pairs and why those fees were chosen:

**Tier 1**: Stable pools need to have the lowest possible but still attractive fees for LPs to leverage trading routes with major integrators. Therefore fees for this tier are set as low as possible. Gauntlet claimed that they increased our Stab3l pool performance with their analytical mechanisms. However, this modification was done manually after consultation with a DAO member [[3]](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/balancer-optimizes-capital-efficiency-and-doubles-lp-revenue-using-gauntlet-865584bcca2a).

**Tier 2**: Standard pools and index pairs will have a max. standard swap fee of <0.1% but will usually range around 0.0.025% and 0.05%. This is in line with competing protocols that charge around 0.05% for pools like WBTC/WETH and WETH/STABLE pools

**Tier 3**: Pairs containing BAL tokens should have fees >1% as this would greatly improve rewards for liquidity providers as well as the treasury. We argue that setting ecosystem fees to such a high number should not have any immediate effect as other incentives, such as the upcoming veBAL [[4]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a) system guarantee that BAL liquidity stays within the protocol

**Tier 4**: Swap fees for experimental or other ecosystem pairs can go up as high as 5-10%. An example are the element.fi pools that are currently set at 10%

## Phase 2: dynamic control by the treasury subDAO

The specifications for phase 2 are not fully set. A possibility is to assign a group of multisig signers that can adjust swap fee percentages “on the fly” as they see fit. This implementation would have the advantage that we could quickly adjust fee structures based on market conditions and / or other factors like partnerships.

## Phase 3: fully automated control with strategically fixed values

The ultimate goal is to replace the closed-source gauntlet algorithm with our own implementation. We want an open-source and well documented system where anybody can contribute and improve upon. The new system should adjust swap fees based on clearly defined parameters and should be able to react quickly - so that we do not end up with a weekly fee update as it is currently done by Gauntlet. Other protocols have successfully introduced dynamic fee control based on market conditions [[5]](https://blog.synthetix.io/dynamic-exchange-fees-explained/).

## Additional delegation power: setting amplification factors

Governance has delegated to Gauntlet the power to set not only swap fees but also the amplification factor of stable and metastable pools. All of these permissions need to be handed over to some other party or revoked. We propose to also hand over the control of the amplification factor to the Balancer DAO, as Gauntled was so kind to hand over ownership of their Gnosis safe.

# Implementation
## Implementation for Swap Fee Control

Fee controllers for each chain will be set as follows:

|Chain|Controller|Change|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mainnet | [Gauntled controller contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4a8ed6c1d8d048bd29a00946bfcf2db10e7923b/advanced#writeContract) | Yes - hand over control, add new signers|
|Polygon|[Polygon Gnosis Safe](https://bafybeih5ygj2c5iwcusasd7lr3oqv5kxbblhtivkd7vk3h4wps45kxdofy.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io/#/wallet/0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80)|no change|
|Arbitrum|[Arbitrum Gnosis Safe](https://bafybeih5ygj2c5iwcusasd7lr3oqv5kxbblhtivkd7vk3h4wps45kxdofy.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io/#/wallet/0x6207ed574152496c9B072C24FD87cE9cd9E17320)|no change|

As seen in the table above, only for mainnet a change has to be initiated as follows:
Gauntled offered to hand over the ownership of their fee setter contract at https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4a8ed6c1d8d048bd29a00946bfcf2db10e7923b/advanced#writeContract
for mainnet. The signers of the Liquidity mining distribution safe at https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860/settings/owners will be added to the above mentioned contract. These are:

* 0x1b004189e64d5b2F71d5Be554470E6c49e10123B
* 0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3

* 0xc4591c41e01a7a654B5427f39Bbd1dEe5bD45D1D

## Implementation for Amplification Factor Control

* No action is required by the governance multisig in any network.
* The set of owners of Gauntlet’s Gnosis Safe (0xf4a80929163c5179ca042e1b292f5efbbe3d89e6) will be modified to the following list of addresses:
  * 0x1b004189e64d5b2F71d5Be554470E6c49e10123B
  * 0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3
  * 0x58Ff691f7849b0666085CFb693568160Cfb9d22D

  * 0xc4591c41e01a7a654B5427f39Bbd1dEe5bD45D1D

These are the same signers currently in charge of the Liquidity mining distribution safe at [0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860/settings/owners).

Hello friends, Ballers, and Balancer community!

We are [SymmetricDAO](https://symmetric.finance/), a Balancer fork currently of v1 (launching v2 in the next few weeks) deployed on Gnosis Chain and Celo. We are big fans of what Balancer has brought to innovate the world of decentralized finance and want to see the protocol expand.

Quick Summary
- We believe in the friendly fork model and aim to share economics, knowledge, and network with the BalancerDAO.

- We are experienced with the Balancer protocol, having successfully run a Balancer V1 fork on two chains for over 9 months.

- Being an early builder in the xDAI (now Gnosis) ecosystem and having completed a Celo-native Incubator, we are considered a “ Chain native project” on both xDAI and Gnosis. We have strong relationships with builders and the wider community on both chains.

- We propose Symmetric becomes the first official friendly fork on Celo and Gnosis Chain.

- SymmetricDAO is willing to offer 20000 SYMM (6.9% of circulating supply | 4% of max supply) instantly and offers BalancerDAO the ability to earn approximately 7.5% of the max supply if it actively LPs in Symmetric V2.0.

- We request 10,000 BAL to seed liquidity for 50% SYMM <> 50% BAL pools on Symmetric V2.0 and Balancer on Mainnet. In addition, we request a strategic grant of $100K USDC to fuel the further development and marketing of Symmetric V2.0.

- Once stable and mature on Celo and GnosisChain, SymmetricDAO is willing to lead/support complementary Friendly Fork deployments on alternative chains that the Balancer ecosystem aims to venture into.

Project Team

SymmetricDAO is a diverse and committed community that launched Symmetric Finance, a fork of Balancer V1.0, in June of 2021 on Gnosis Chain (then xDAI) and Celo in October 2021. The core team consists of the 3 project founders (2 Engineers and a Business Development Lead), two additional engineers, an ecosystem coordinator, and a marketer. Developers and other SymmetricDAO contributors support the core team. Our primary governance mechanism is Moloch V2.0 on Gnosis Chain, through which the Symm stakeholders align on initiatives by the DAO.

Background on the Friendly Fork
We’re just weeks away from launching Symmetric V2.0 (fork of Balancer V2.0) and have recently [partnered with PrimeDAO](https://twitter.com/PrimeDAO_/status/1504487724794867715) to collective bring their LBP, Rating & Deals technology to Celo & Gnosis; we think this is the perfect time to formalize the relationship between Symmetric and BalancerDAO.

Besides partnering with PrimeDAO, we are also (with success) re-engaging both Celo and Gnosis Chain to increase the ecosystem support and native token rewards allocated to Symmetric. We have already secured ~1M in ecosystem resources and liquidity rewards for Symmetric V2.0 and aim to request more once if and when this Balancer Friendly Fork proposal passes.

Our vision is to become the number one liquidity protocol on Celo and Gnosis chain by pro-actively building an ecosystem of DAOs and services around our Balancer Friendly Fork deployment.

We propose Symmetric becomes the first official friendly fork on Celo and Gnosis Chain.

Commitment of the Organizations
Both parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following:

SymmetricDAO

* To issue 20000 SYMM (7.1% of circulating supply | 4% of max supply) instantly and offers BalancerDAO the ability to earn approximately 7.5% of the max supply if it actively LPs in Symmetric V2.0.
* To create, maintain and incentivize SYMM <> BAL liquidity pools on Symmetric V2.0 (both Celo and Gnosis Network) and Balancer Protocol on mainnet.
* To support the development of the Balancer Protocol and subsequent Balancer Friendly forks.

BalancerDAO

* To acknowledge Symmetric as the first Balancer Friendly Fork on Celo and Gnosis Chain.
* To send 10,000 BAL to SymmetricDAO to be used to bootstrap SYMM <> BAL liquidity on Celo, Gnosis Chain, and Mainnet.
* To issue a 100,000 USDC Grant to Symmetric for further development and expansion.

To get the most out of the Friendly fork, both DAOs also agree to:
Co-marketing
- To ensure both entities will profit from each other's reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.

Knowledge and research sharing
- To share the latest technical insights about the Balancer protocol and collaborate on a joint ecosystemic technical roadmap. The DAOs will also support each other when collectively engaging third parties for mutual benefits.

Friendly Fork Agreement
If accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title and rides with a one-month notice period.

Symmetric's ETH Address for their $100,000 and 10,000 BAL is 0x3d70E1b46FFC3B1b4ed72Ec1F56a747D33902210","[""Yes, let's do it."", 'No, this is not the way.']","[27309.77276875284, 388467.78757002816]",0

## Summary

A series of actions need to happen for the new veBAL tokenomics system to be deployed. This proposal asks for the governance multisig to grant permissions for the coordinator smart contract in order to enable it to perform the actions necessary to successfully deploy the ve system.

## **Core proposal**

As approved by governance[[1]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html), the ve system pioneered by Curve has been chosen to be used as the new tokenomics for BAL.

Since the community approved that proposal, some Balancer Labs engineers and community members have been hard at work to make this viable. I'm excited to share that we have defined dates for the deployment of the system:

* **28th March: launch of veBAL.** On this date all smart contracts necessary for the system to work as described in the new tokenomics proposal will be active, with the exception of the bridges for Arbitrum and Polygon which will take a couple extra weeks. In the meantime, LM for Arbitrum and Polygon will continue as is today.
* **7th April: beginning of Liquidity Mining using onchain ve contracts for Ethereum mainnet gauges.** Since Balancer LPs need to have some time to stake their BPTs into the new gauge system, I propose we consider all BPTs as still eligible for liquidity mining until April 7th 0:00 UTC. From this day on, only staked BPTs will be able to claim BAL from LM.

## Implementation

The governance multisig needs to call the authorizer[[2]](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa331d84ec860bf466b4cdccfb4ac09a1b43f3ae6#code) with the following inputs: `authorizer.grantRole(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, coordinator)` , which means it will grant full admin powers to the coordinator smart contract.

Only by end of next week (March 25th) will the coordinator be deployed, as it's currently undergoing final adjustments. Since it hasn't been deployed yet, its address is not known. However, the Balancer community will be able to verify the coordinator address by that date on Balancer's github in the deployment output folder[[3]](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220325-veBAL-deployment-coordinator/output/mainnet.json). This link will point to a json file with entry `veBALCoordinator` followed by the coordinator's address on mainnet:

`{   veBALCoordinator: 0xabced...., }`

After deploying the whole system and activating the Liquidity Mining on the new ve system on April 7th, the coordinator will renounce all given permissions and will not be usable anymore.

## **Voting**

Since this governance permission has to be granted before the 28th March for the above deployment plan to work, this proposal should be posted to snapshot ideally by no later than March 22nd. It has no unexpected requests and simply aims at executing the already well discussed and approved veBAL tokenomics, so I hope it will be unanimously welcomed by the Balancer community.

Happy to answer any questions as always =)

*This is a proposal by the Ops subDAO, specifically Solarcurve, Mog, and mkflow.*

# Introduction

As part of the [Balancer subDAO formation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66) proposal, the Ops subDAO was delegated the power of compensation. It is our responsibility to set clear and uniform guidelines for fair compensation across the DAO. Inspired by the recent [Yearn compensation overhaul](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-66-streamlining-contributor-compensation/12247), Ops has been considering what an effective compensation system might look like for Balancer DAO. The following section will outline our proposed plan and we intend to open the discussion up to the wider community to gather feedback before committing to the new structure in the next quarter.

The primary benefits that this proposal delivers are the following:

* Reduces sell pressure on BAL from DAO compensation
* Helps the DAO’s most active contributors build voting power at an accelerated rate
* Allows each contributor to tailor their compensation to fit their needs

*Note: This only addresses fixed monthly salaries or “balleries”. Coordinape and one time grants from the grants subDAO are outside the scope of this plan and will continue as is.*

# Specification

There will be no more half or full balleries or 60/40 liquid/vesting split. Instead, base compensation will be in fully liquid stablecoins paid monthly. These funds would come from the DAO’s 25% cut of revenues under the veBAL system. **The base compensation for a full time contributor will be fixed to $5,000 per month.** Each contributor has the option to convert some or all of their stablecoins to locked veBAL at a sliding discount according to the following:

*bal_discount = weeks_locked * 0.010416*

|Lock Duration|Discount|
| --- | --- |
|3 months|12.5%|
|6 months|25%|
|9 months|37.5%|
|12 months (max)|50%|

The max amount of BAL a contributor can purchase can be calculated by the following:

**max_bal**: maximum amount of BAL that can be purchased by this contributor this month
**comp**: contributor compensation in stables this month
**bal_price**: current BAL price in USD

*max_bal = comp / (1 - bal_discount) * bal_price*

**Example**: You are a full time contributor and your base compensation is $5,000. BAL price is $20. You plan to lock in veBAL for 6 months (30 weeks). Your bal_discount is 25%. If you convert your entire compensation to veBAL, you’d get a max_bal of 333.33 BAL. You decide to only convert half of your compensation to veBAL and take the other half in stables.

You receive 2,500 in stables and 166.67 BAL to be locked in veBAL for 6 months.

*Note that for now locking BAL into veBAL will be a manual process that each contributor is responsible for doing. You’ll need to single asset deposit to BAL/WETH then lock into veBAL. Gas for these transactions will not be reimbursed, so factor this into your decision. Proof of these transactions must be provided to a signer of Ops before the next compensation disbursement.*

Only one address per contributor is allowed. It will not be possible to choose to lock for 6 months then the next month choose to lock for two months as each address can only have one lock. If you want to fully cash out you would simply let your lock expire and if you choose to use your discount it would get progressively smaller as the months go by, until you fully unlock.

## Old Vesting Contracts

Any existing vesting contracts will remain in effect and unchanged. They are immutable by design so there is unfortunately no way to retire them. Ops does not plan to use them again in the future.

## Peer Reviews & Self Assessment

As we continue to iterate on effective methods of accountability, Ops would like to introduce a trial run of peer reviews across all DAO contributors. For those attached to one or multiple subDAO’s/working groups, you will be asked to evaluate the contributions and behavior of your fellow members. For everyone else, you would submit peer reviews on whoever you’ve interacted with in the course of your contributions.

You will also be asked to assess your own contributions and engagement over the past month. For example, if you have not spent much time contributing during the month you might select a “Low” level of engagement, which would translate into a lower fixed salary. Next month if things change and you contribute a lot, you might select a “High” level of engagement and you would receive a higher fixed salary, up to a maximum of $5,000.

These will **not** be anonymous but the results will only be shared with the signers of Ops and held in the strictest of confidence. In the final week of each month, a google form will be provided to all contributors earning a fixed salary or who have been awarded GIVE on Coordinape. This form is expected to take **no longer than 30 minutes** to complete and **must be submitted before your compensation for that month will be distributed.**

## SubDAO/Working Group Leaders

We recognize that some subDAO’s have coalesced around a single leader and we have considered formally recognizing these positions in the form of clear expectations and increased compensation. In the spirit of decentralization, it is important that we do not become too reliant on single individuals. There should always be the opportunity for leaders to emerge organically without needing the blessing of Ops. Anyone at any time can be a leader and in some situations no clear leader is even necessary.

Rewarding leaders for stepping up is important because we want to encourage good leadership in the DAO. We think Coordinape represents an elegant solution here - fellow contributors will recognize good leadership and are empowered to reward it on their own. With this in mind and the wide support Coordinape has received over the past two month trial period, Ops plans to increase the budget for this initiative going forward.

## Mandatory KPI’s

Transitioning compensation to stables protects against BAL volatility and offers more security for core contributors. As part of this initiative, Ops will be asking each subDAO/working group to provide 1-3 KPI’s (key performance indicators) that can be used to measure their performance over each quarter. This not only provides another input for Ops to judge fair and adequate compensation but also shows token holders how all of us are adding value to the Balancer Protocol.

**Examples**:

*Partnerships subDAO sets a KPI of 5 projects bribing at least $500k/week in the BAL Wars by the end of the quarter*

*Marketing subDAO sets a KPI of growing @Balancer twitter to 10k followers by the end of the quarter*

*Ops subDAO sets a KPI of onboarding three new contributors (paid at least one month) by the end of the quarter*

*Treasury subDAO sets a KPI of adding at least $3M of Protocol Owned Liquidity by the end of the quarter*

# Conclusion

This proposal introduces several changes and should be carefully considered by all contributors. Ops is keen to hear input and iterate as needed. Overall this puts the DAO on a more sustainable compensation trajectory, adds more structure, and increases accountability. Ops believes these are all positive steps towards a better DAO for everyone.

**A yes vote would put this new system in place starting in Q2. A no vote keeps us on the existing system for another quarter.**

### *Appendix - Projection of Salary Change Impact*

If we take [March base compensation](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/6fbcb710d23d4a94bf3f1b8df7311ce2?v=90468971e408439cae22b0dbb6c0baf8) and assume an average of 75% engagement with no veBAL discount participation, you get (5000 * 0.75) * 17 contributors on fixed salary = **$63,750 per month** in compensation. This compares to **$74,800 per month** under the existing system, assuming $11 BAL.

If we assume half of total contributors choose to max lock discounted veBAL, you get (5000 * 0.75) * 8.5 + (5000 * 0.75) * 8.5 * 2 = **$95,625 per month** in compensation, with $31,875 paid in stables and $63,750 paid in BAL at a 50% discount, locked for one year.

Based on the most recent [revenue projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSFTtEYg1kqRVvvPfFpqLT93PtZWBjEQfPf8-lH93_0/edit#gid=0) from Treasury subDAO, if we assume $95,625 per month in compensation expense that comes to $1,147,500 per year. That is an increase of $267,516 from the current projected compensation expense, which would reduce the DAO’s expected yearly profit from ~$1.3M to ~$1.1M.","[""Yes, let's do it."", 'No, this is not the way.']","[276813.2701147521, 1156.3005420662166]",1

*This is a proposal by the Treasury subDAO, specifically Solarcurve, Xeonus, Zekraken, and Luuk.*

# Motivation

With the recent approval by governance of veBAL, the Treasury subDAO has been tasked with sweeping collected protocol fees, converting them to bbaUSD, and sending them to veBAL lockers. The protocol fees will be split with 75% going to veBAL and 25% going to Balancer DAO. Treasury subDAO is best positioned to manage the investment of the DAO’s share of revenue.

All collected protocol fees up to the time of veBAL activation will go to Balancer DAO. Treasury subDAO will initiate a sweep of all collected protocol fees just before the launch of veBAL and invest them on behalf of the DAO. Going forward, protocol fees will be distributed to veBAL on a weekly basis. This process will be completely transparent - anyone interested in observing should reach out in #treasury in discord.

The needs of Balancer DAO will change over time so the methodology we will use to invest the DAO’s share of revenue will also change. The main pillars of the initial framework around how protocol fees are invested are:

* Reduce selling pressure on BAL as a result of DAO operations
  * Use protocol fees to accumulate stables to use for compensation/budget requirements, rather than using BAL that guaranteed gets sold.
* Ensure operational runway for the DAO in any market conditions
  * Building a base of stables helps to ensure the DAO can continue to operate in an extended downturn for BAL price
* Maximize the risk-adjusted yield for all DAO assets
  * USDC is less risky than FEI but earns a lower yield for example. Generally, we plan to be more risk-averse than yield-seeking.
* Build Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL)
  * bbaUSD is an example of a low risk stable product that earns a guaranteed yield and helps Balancer by increasing TVL, volume, and fees. POL creates a tailwind behind the growth of Balancer’s key metrics and we plan to stack diversified POL as much as we reasonably can.

# Risks

* Treasury subDAO goes rogue and sends swept fees to their personal wallets
  * Mitigation: The DAO Multisig will sweep collected protocol fees to a gnosis safe with the Treasury subDAO signers (Solarcurve, Xeonus, Luuk, Zekraken). Transactions will require three out of four signatures to execute. The process of converting fees to stables will take place during our weekly meeting and is open to the public to observe.

# Specification

In order to account for gas costs and the time investment of Treasury subDAO signers, collected protocol fees will only be “swept” if the token balance exceeds $10k on Ethereum and $5k on Polygon & Arbitrum.

The process for sweeping fees and sending to veBAL will be as follows:

1. Governance multisig on each chain will initiate a transaction to sweep collected fees meeting the above criteria to a gnosis safe controlled by Treasury subDAO
2. Treasury subDAO will sell assets to stablecoins for veBAL and trade as necessary based on how the DAO plans to invest their portion
3. Treasury subDAO will bridge stablecoins for veBAL back to mainnet. The DAO’s share may or may not be bridged to mainnet.
4. Treasury subDAO will send bbaUSD to the veBAL distribution contract and send the DAO’s share to the DAO Multisig. Treasury subDAO will not custody DAO funds after this process is completed.

**To be clear, a “Yes” vote would give the power to invest the DAO’s share of protocol fees to the Treasury subDAO at their discretion (trading assets, providing liquidity, etc). A “No” vote would mean the DAO’s share of protocol fees will simply be swept into the Treasury Multisig on each chain in whatever asset they happen to be in.**

No matter the outcome, Treasury subDAO will still be sweeping protocol fees and converting 75% to bbaUSD to pay out to veBAL until an automated solution is put in place.","[""Yes, let's do it."", 'No, this is not the way.']","[294851.1128974423, 743.1309629050285]",1

**Background**

The Friendly Fork model (aka Franchise model) was first introduced by @followthechain in this [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-on-other-chains-friendly-forks-aka-franchise-model/2279).

The general reasoning behind the proposal was to make the Balancer technology available on chains where Balancer.fi was not present and to avoid an increase in workload by the Balancer Labs core team.

The FF model, at the moment, has only been applied on one occasion with the approval of [Beethovenx](https://beets.fi/#/) through this [snapshot vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc).

The extraordinary [success](https://twitter.com/beethoven_x/status/1503647503698247680) that ""Beets"" has achieved to date, has created an appetite for the recreation of a similar model that could use the same superior technology (the Balancer technology), but with a different, own identity adapted to the market intended to enter.

**Motivation**

Current market conditions show a consistent increase in trading activity on Avalanche, which has demonstrated to be one of the most active and vibrant communities in the DeFi landscape. The strategic decision of the Balancer team not to deploy on this chain has pushed the Partnership subDAO towards the exploration of possible valid alternatives with the intention of recreating, at least partially, the success of BeethovenX.

Launching a Friendly Fork by the DAO however, proved to be a complex exercise with mainly three factors that strongly influenced the decision making process:

1. Team: finding a team that is able to develop, maintain and dedicate resources to the project;
2. Chain: current market conditions present two options:
--> develop a product on a highly competitive and possibly saturated chain or
--> be a first mover on ""nascent"" chains with the associated risk of not being relevant and wasting resources;

3. Liquidity: how to bootstrap decent liquidity from day one (critical factor).

To minimise these risks, the Partnership subDAO believed in the creation of a “hub”, by deeply concentrating synergies with experienced players in the DeFi ecosystem and building a joint project.

**Introducing Hexagon Finance**

Hexagon will be a multi-functional platform, with the intention of intercepting the different needs of the Avalanche crypto Community by bringing a new decentralized exchange, a launch-pad and a lending platform.

*Ava Labs blessing*: A critical role has been played by Ava Labs which has operated as an important bridge between the later to be named Hexagon team and BalancerDAO.

Moreover, Avalabs has committed some initial funds specifically dedicated to the Liquidity Mining program. This will help for the bootstrapping of liquidity and attracting fresh capital from competing chains.

*Terra Labs Partnership*: Hexagon Finance will be mainly focused on UST, the algo stable coin of Terra, with the ultimate goal of making it the most used and widely distributed stable-coin on Avalanche.

TerraLabs will join the project by being a major stakeholder together with BalancerDAO and the founding team. Terralabs has committed for an initial capital deployment (UST) to help the project building the initial phase of liquidity bootstrapping.

The launchpad functionality will be developed by Copperlaunch, a long term partner of Balancer.

**Specification**

The agreement between Hexagon Finance and BalancerDAO has been built around a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which will be signed by a BalancerDAO representative if this proposal is accepted.

General conditions are the following:
BalancerDAO is requesting the following

*1. Governance*

* The community on the host chain fully supports the fork development;
* Teams should adhere to a level of code of conduct that is in line with the core values of the Balancer community.

*2. Technical*

*   1. Balancer V2 core contracts should be deployed without any changes, (Contracts deployed 1:1)
*   2. No migration functionality in the MasterChef;
*   3. All controllable protocol parameters need to be managed by reputable multisig.

*3. Financial*

Hexagon Finance undertakes to provide Balancer with as many tokens as the Hexagon team. Tokens will be received under the same conditions in terms of vesting and release. This means 6% of the total supply, or 6 million tokens out of 100,000,000, whose release will be locked for 6 months upon launch and linearly vested for 12 to 24 months. The exact length of time will be finalized upon the completion of the private sale round, if any.

The tokens will be claimable using an address chosen by Balancer.

In exchange for the above conditions, Hexagon requires Balancer to engage mainly in Marketing activities and awareness campaigns as detailed below:

* Tweeting original content about Hexagon Finance for the four weeks prior to our launch and for the two months following it. The tweet will come from the BalancerDAO handle.

* Creating and publishing announcements regarding the activities of Hexagon Finance. This will cover every major activity such as, but not limited to, airdrops, launches, new pools being created and products being launched.

* Organizing Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions with the Balancer community to promote the launch of Hexagon and eventual upgrades/news afterward. At a minimum, this will include an AMA shortly before or after the launch of the Hexagon Dex.

* Hexagon Finance is authorized to use the name and logo of Balancer in its official documents in statements with pre-approval on logo usage from BalancerDAO such as “the officially approved fork of Balancer on Avalanche” and similar;

* Providing statements from official representatives of BalancerDAO in support of Hexagon to influencers, media outlets, and similar. This will include both written and audio statements as required by the channel used (articles, video, podcasts etc.). At least one statement should be shared before the launch of the platform.

* In general, making it clear to the Balancer community that Hexagon is an officially approved fork of the Balancer Protocol on Avalanche.

**Tokenomics**

Token allocation will be distributed as follow:
|18%|Team - BalancerDAO - Terra Labs|
| --- | --- |
|5%|Strategy investors|
|2%|Liquidity bootstrapping|
|10%|Marketing|
|10%|Partners and Advisors|
|55%|Liquidity Mining incentives|

**SWOT Analysis**

*Strengths*

The Partnership subDAO believes that the blessing of Avalabs, the partnership with Terralabs and the reliability of the funding team are the main points of strength. The Avalanche ecosystem is already highly competitive so risk mitigations strategies have been considered necessary for the development of Hexagon Finance;

*Weaknesses*

* Making UST as the main focal point can be a double edged sword for two reasons:

1. focussing on one stable coin creates an overexposure that some would consider unnecessary in terms of point of failure;
2. the general missing of potential trading volume on alternative pairs.

* While the BeethovenX Friendly Fork agreement has been reached after launch, in this case, the agreement should be reached before. Consequently bringing a certain level of uncertainty. However, the Partnership subDAO believes that risks have been reduced considerably given the deep due diligence done on the team and the partners involved in this collaboration.

The DeFi landscape is still in its early stages and layers of uncertainty are very much present, especially in today’s market conditions. A constantly evolving market generates certain known unknowns and a level of unpredictability that needs to be taken into account when operating in cutting edge environments.

*Opportunities*

The BalancerDAO will finally have the opportunity to have a stake in a project with strong backing, good fundamentals and exposure to a strategic chain. This is, today, the best opportunity we see for a successful Balancer powered Dex on Avalanche.

*Threats*

Competition is high! Even if Hexagon would focus mainly on UST trading pairs, more established and long term native players still control the vast majority of the market.

Conclusion

We present this as a great opportunity to the Balancer Community. Hexagon will ultimately increase the number of independent teams working and using the Balancer technology. This project will also increase the number of developers working on the protocol, give precious feedback to the Balancer core team and ultimately, inspire us all to do better. Similar to what Beethoven has been doing during the past few months.

I hope this presentation gives you enough context to where we have been, where we are, and where we want to go: up only.

In the first few weeks of January, engineers at Balancer Labs noticed the protocol fee collector contract was amassing relatively large amounts of wstETH, which was unexpected given the corresponding pool's low trading volume.

Upon further investigation, it was detected that this happens because, when computing the fees it owes to the protocol the pool assumes that any increase in its value between two joins/exits is due to swap fees. This is however not true when pools contain tokens like wstETH, which increases in value over time. The combination of the protocol fee collection design and the rebasing nature of wstETH results in Balancer collecting a feee (set to 10% between Jan 4th and Feb 21st) of the wstETH appreciation.

However, at the time the Balancer app did not take this dimension into consideration when displaying the expected APR of the pool. A hotfix was deployed on Jan 21st to address this issue.

While this only has a minor effect on liquidity providers expected returns, we want to be fully transparent about the issue and present the community with an alternative to make liquidity providers whole. It would consist of refunding the protocol level fees collected from the wstETH pool over the period of time when the APR was incorrectly displayed on the frontend, plus a two week grace period. 

Refunds would be computed in the following manner:
 * For every week $w$ between Jan 3rd and Feb 6th (5 weeks), compute the amount $A_w$ of wstETH received by the protocol fee collector (https://dune.xyz/queries/452650)
 * Compute the amounts $a_{i,w}$ owed to each liquidity provider $i$, as if $A_w = \sum_i(a_{i,w})$ was uniformly owed over the entire week. This allows us to reuse the liquidity mining scripts to compute the distributions. ([GitHub](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/commit/cbcbf22ff159474ada88f24084fbf34119ef4bc0))
 * Compute the amounts $A_i = \sum_w(a_{i,w})$ owed to each liquidity provider $i$ ([GitHub](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/commit/f6f0da6b6b96c1c307749626e5a952d903d968db#diff-e746f3e8394249cb8a1d08b5552ffdbc6ecd0bac06844f13c2c44a6d91221b08))

This results in 221 recipients, ~75% of which would be entitled to less than 0.01 wstETH, which suggests the best form of distribution would be an airdrop. Gas cost is estimated at ~6.000,000 million gas based on [similar transactions](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfd7f45fad4036a806b57a1460c0e3e2639cdd8cacf32114ac39ba32d2c9c72fe), meaning 0.6 ETH if we assume 100 Gwei gas price, to be paid be the DAO's Treasury.

If this proposal is approved by governance, 28.360863560000002 wstETH would be transferred from the protocol fee collector to the Baller's liquidity mining distributor multisig, from where they'd be airdroppped to the recipients as per the report available [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/commit/f6f0da6b6b96c1c307749626e5a952d903d968db#diff-e746f3e8394249cb8a1d08b5552ffdbc6ecd0bac06844f13c2c44a6d91221b08)

**Summary**
In an effort to scale the amount of quality, long-form research available, we are proposing Balancer joins the [Messari Hub](https://messari.io/hub) to commission quarterly financial reports. This would serve to better inform the crypto ecosystem on major developments and ongoing fundamental changes, effectively attracting more builders, investors, and traders to the ecosystem.

**Background**
The Messari Hub is a community-driven marketplace for public research where we work with top projects and independent analysts to increase the amount of quality, open source [research](https://messari.io/research/hub). One particular area of research we think many DeFi projects would benefit from is more standardized financial reporting with contextual analysis.

An example of this was in our [recent](https://messari.io/article/state-of-compound-q3-2021) Q3 report for Compound where we outlined all the key fundamental data points and analyzed why they occurred. We also took a look at major governance decisions over the past three months and assessed the implications of upcoming changes to the protocol.


In addition, we would build and maintain a comprehensive [data dashboard](https://dune.xyz/messari/Messari:-Compound-Macro-Financial-Statements) to view these metrics in real-time.

All reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter (210k subscribers) and various social channels.

**Rationale**

We believe the actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate stakeholders on the economic, financial, and social health of the project, whether it’s a surge in certain markets liquidity/volume or the implications of a major governance decision. As more players in the space are adequately informed it will help them make better decisions and allocate resources more effectively.

Furthermore, as more and more traditional institutions get onboarded to DeFi they will seek to have consistent reporting similar to quarterly financial reports and sell-side equity research with which to rely on to make key decisions. By blending the objective reporting of a 10-Q with the contextualization of sell-side research, these players will grow increasingly comfortable trading with and investing in this new financial infrastructure.

**Terms**

We are requesting a payment of 125,000 USDC to be sent to messari.eth which resolves to 0x6fA2BACF752DAb6cb6E4B922321F03b4Cb61D141

Reports will be produced in the 2 weeks following the end of the next 4 quarters starting with a Q1 report released in April.

# Motivation 

Almost four months ago, Balancer’s governance process was formally overhauled and handed off to the DAO through [this proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x3bbcaaad4f0a928b8dabaf97bfd9679752254aee6e63597df32a7453663354d6). Overall I would argue the revamp did increase the transparency and effectiveness of our governance process but some critical problems have become clear to me lately.

The ultimate authority of our governance process is BAL token holders. Currently, in order for a proposal to proceed for a vote it must have a majority of the Gov Council signal that the proposal has reached “soft consensus in the community”. Ballers and DAO contributors represent the majority of active community members. It’s not a stretch to imagine a scenario where large token holders support a proposal but the Ballers/active community do not. We have created a system where the Gov Council acts as gatekeepers with full control over what proceeds to a vote and what doesn’t.

Thus, I would make the argument that “soft consensus in the community” should NOT be a factor when considering a proposal to move forward to a vote. We must avoid the situation where core DAO contributors are against a proposal that has large token holder support, and that proposal does not proceed to a vote because it lacks “soft consensus in the community”.

# Specification

The Gov Council will remain in place and their approval will still be required for a proposal to move to a vote. However, they will not vote on whether “soft consensus in the community” has been reached. Instead, the question will be “Is this a well defined proposal?”

What is the criteria for a “well defined” proposal?

* Includes a “Motivation”, “Specification”, and if applicable a “Risks” section
* If on-chain execution from the DAO Multisig is required, the “Specification” section must contain transaction details (address to send funds to, contract to interact with/function to call, etc)
* The intent of the proposal must be clear (not spam)
* BAL token holders must have the power to implement the proposal
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit the FEI in our treasury into a new degen farm. As part of the [subDAO formation proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66), the power to farm was delegated to the Treasury subDAO. BAL token holders cannot vote on how we farm with non-BAL treasury assets, so this proposal would not proceed to a vote. However, a proposal to remove the power to farm from the Treasury subDAO is within the scope of BAL token holders. If this proposal passes successfully, then the proposal to farm with FEI could go to a vote.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deploy Balancer to Optimism. Balancer Labs has sole discretion over core protocol development. BAL token holders do not have the power to compel Balancer Labs to act. It is solely the choice of Balancer Labs to create an official deployment of Balancer on Optimism, or not. Thus, this proposal would not proceed to a vote as BAL token holders lack the power to implement it.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit 100k BAL to Aave to earn a yield. BAL token holders have the power to allocate BAL held in the treasury, so as long as the other criteria for a “well defined” proposal are met, this would proceed to a vote.

If the Gov Council fails to execute their duties in good faith and votes against a “well defined” proposal proceeding to a vote, a proposal to replace the Gov Council with a different mechanism should be made ASAP.

**Finally, this proposal would also implement a required minimum quorum of 100k BAL. Any snapshot vote that does not reach 100k total BAL voted AND at least 51% voting in favor would be considered to fail.**","[""Yes, let's do it."", 'No, this is not the way.']","[40223.60717168847, 0]",1

# Motivation

Recently, Fei Labs announced [Tribe Turbo](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/the-tribe-dao-strongly-believes-that-a-healthy-and-thriving-defi-ecosystem-needs-a-robust-platform-b1faea700dfa), a way for DAO’s to issue Fei at no cost into Fuse pools of their choice. The Treasury subDAO has been evaluating this opportunity and believes there is likely market demand for users to borrow against their BPT’s (Balancer Pool Tokens) while still earning any BAL or other token incentives. Credit to Jared for preparing this helpful infographic which illustrates what will take place.

As part of the recent treasury swap with Fei, Balancer DAO has 2.45M FEI. As an initial allocation to gauge market demand, we propose to deposit 100k BAL into Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]) and borrow up to 10% of the current market value in FEI - we will also add 1M FEI from our current holdings for a total of ~1.1 - 1.2M FEI to be deposited into Fuse Pool [y].

The Treasury subDAO will monitor the health of the FEI loan against our 100k BAL and either add more BAL collateral or pay down the debt using our existing FEI holdings to protect against any possibility of liquidation.

The initial list of BPT’s users can deposit into Fuse Pool [y] will be wstETH/WETH, WBTC/WETH, WETH/DAI, WETH/BAL, WBTC/renBTC/sBTC, FEI/WETH, bbfUSD (Fuse boosted pool DAI/FEI/LUSD), and bbaUSD (Aave Boosted Pool DAI/USDC/USDT). As previously mentioned, any liquidity mining incentives will still be captured so users do not miss out on any yield by using Fuse Pool [y].

Since Tribe DAO has a lot of experience managing Fuse pools, the Treasury subDAO will let them manage Fuse Pool [y]. However, the Treasury subDAO will retain decision making authority around adding/removing BPT’s and setting the maximum LTV for each BPT. Any decision would be given to Tribe DAO to execute.

An important final consideration is that any FEI borrowed through Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]) is subject to an 80/20 split of the borrow interest with 80% going to Tribe DAO and 20% to Balancer DAO. Treasury subDAO has provided feedback that a 50/50 split would make increased usage of Turbo more palatable, though for now the 80/20 split remains the most likely reality. Credit to Jared again for this comparison of both revenue scenarios.

# KPI

Treasury subDAO is targetting a minimum of 50% utilization on borrowable FEI in Fuse Pool [y] as a sign that market demand does exist for borrowing against BPT collateral. This metric will be assessed 30 days after our deposit into Turbo to show either this is a worthwhile allocation of capital or we need to reconsider the value add. 

# Risks

* Turbo is a new product that, while audited, is untested. There is the possibility of a smart contract bug which causes a complete loss of our BAL deposited as collateral to Fuse Pool [x].
  * **Mitigation**: Tribe DAO has offered to give us an OTC insurance quote. This can be pursued if the Treasury subDAO feels it is appropriate.

* If utilization of FEI is very high in Fuse Pool [y] and the price of BAL drops very quickly, it may not be possible to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool [y] to re-pay the FEI we borrowed from Fuse Pool [x]. This scenario could result in liquidation of the BAL we deposited to Fuse Pool [x].
  * **Mitigation**: Treasury subDAO should be prepared to add additional BAL collateral and/or use other liquid cash-equivalent assets in Balancer DAO’s treasury like USDC or FEI to re-pay the Fuse Pool [x] loan in an emergency. Additionally, it may take several days for the DAO Multisig to execute the necessary transaction(s) which must be factored in.
* Tribe DAO calls the loan in Fuse Pool [x]. This would trigger a four week period where Balancer DAO must repay the FEI we borrowed in full or risk the BAL collateral being seized.
  * **Mitigation**: Similar to the previous one. We cannot rely on being able to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool [y] in such an emergency, so keeping cash-equivalent liquid assets ready to use in this kind of situation is important.
* Manipulation of the oracle that prices BPT in Fuse Pool [y]. This could result in an exploit that drains funds from Fuse Pool [y].
  * **Mitigation**: BPTs represent full range liquidity - previous instances of this manipulation in Fuse pools has been the result of relying on a Uniswap V3 oracle which represents concentrated liquidity in a specific range. Thus, the risk of this exploit should be very low. If it happens, we might lose the FEI we deposited to Fuse Pool [y] so we’d need to repay our FEI loan using our own funds.

The Treasury subDAO already has the authority to farm with idle non-BAL assets, so only a social vote of the subDAO signers is required to allocate FEI from our current holdings into Fuse Pool [y]. In order to make use of Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]), we require authorization from BAL token holders to use some of the DAO’s BAL holdings.

**The Treasury subDAO requests that governance delegate us the power to allocate up to 500,000 BAL to Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]).** This will allow us to scale up from the initial deposit of 100,000 BAL if we deem it appropriate.

## Summary

Balancer’s DAO2DAO growth model is centrally focused on the development of a flourishing developer ecosystem integrating with the Balancer protocol and building applications on top of Balancer as a core piece of DeFi infrastructure.

The technical benefits of Balancer’s flexible design and the partner-first mentality of the Balancer community have attracted high-value projects that have invested in building innovative solutions using Balancer’s liquidity pools.

To further align the interests of the Balancer community with our ecosystem partners, and to further incentivize the growth of this ecosystem, we propose a model to standardize protocol revenue sharing for all liquidity pool creators.

This model would apply equally to all new pool types and be implemented primarily outside the pool, in a FeeSplitter contract that interacts with the ProtocolFeesCollector, so that the standard is *enforced* rather than *opt-in* .

## Goals

In order of priority:

1. Provide a frictionless rev share experience for developers building novel products on top of Balancer; e.g., yield-space AMMs (Element, Tempus, Sense), Forex markets (HaloDAO), ETFs (PowerPool, Indexed)
2. Minimize governance overhead for the Balancer DAO; i.e., prefer automated solutions over human intervention

## Solution

We prefer a completely permissionless model for sharing revenue with pool creators. That is, any type of pool, from any type of pool factory, can divert a share of its protocol fees to the pool’s “owner” or possibly another dedicated address. Sharing is enabled by default, meaning anyone can create a pool on Balancer and instantly become a partner who participates in the revenue sharing program.

This is made possible by developing a FeeSplitter contract that the Balancer DAO can authorize to withdraw from the ProtocolFeesCollector contract. It would be designed so that anyone can permissionlessly “poke” a given pool to have its collected protocol fees extracted and split in two directions: a share to the pool’s owner, and the remainder to the Balancer Treasury which is managed by the Balancer DAO.

We envision that the default rev share for a given pool would be something small like 10% of protocol fees collected, but that the Balancer DAO would be authorized to “boost” the rev share percentage for any pool or pool factory to a much higher value like 50%. The small default value enables us to stay true to Goal #2, whereas the “boost” capability allows for very high-value partners, such as those listed in Goal #1, to be rewarded for their hard work at the DAO’s discretion.

The most important assumption that makes this model work is that pools collect their protocol fees in the form of BPT. This change is already in the works for upcoming pool factories, but some pools will be too old to have utilized this mechanism and others may find it infeasible. Older pools with owners should simply migrate to the new format when it is available. In special cases where collecting fees as BPT may not be feasible - for example, if a pool contains derivative tokens with expiry dates - the Balancer DAO may opt to manually share revenue with these owners from the Balancer Treasury on a quarterly basis. Given that this operation adds significant overhead for the DAO, violating Goal #2, it will only be performed for “boosted” partners.

## Potential Drawbacks

* **Anyone can be a ""partner.”** This could be viewed as a benefit, but it also has the side effect that there is no clear distinction between a degen pool creator and the designer of a brand new AMM who poured a year of effort into development. Both are equally rewarded proportional to the protocol fees they drive. This is mitigated by the “boost” capability which allows the Balancer DAO to single out high-value partnerships.
* **Liquidity fragmentation.** Sharing revenue with pool creators incentivizes pool creation. This could potentially lead to competition among creators resulting in many similar pools being constructed with different owners. But there are a few reasons that this is less of an issue on V2 than V1:
  * The Balancer Vault used in V2 greatly reduces gas costs for multi-pool trades.
  * Given appreciation in the price of ETH and increased network congestion, the gas cost of pool creation is now quite high, on the order of thousands of dollars.
  * The V2 liquidity mining program directs incentives to individual pools rather than applying globally to all liquidity as in V1. Schelling points will naturally arise from pools favored by LM.

## Benefits

* **Align incentives between the protocol and its partners.** Because shared revenue is proportional to protocol fees collected, incentives are perfectly aligned between the protocol and partners: the more revenue the protocol makes, so too does the partner. This also has a desirable side effect, which is that only pools truly adding value to the protocol will benefit from revenue sharing. This should assuage fears of a “low-effort” cash grab attempt being treated as a partnership; it will only find success if it generates revenue for the protocol.
* **Offset pool creation gas costs.** Balancer has never attempted to reimburse the expense (thousands of dollars) of pool creation. Historically, creation has been an expensive process that can only become profitable if the creator’s own liquidity earns substantial revenue during its lifetime. This means that pool creation has only been profitable for very large players. If, instead, pool creators are rewarded independently of their own liquidity, then pool creation becomes more enticing to smaller players with creative ideas and moderate risk tolerance.
* **Incentivize new markets on Balancer.** Pool creation incentives should lead to a race to establish Schelling points for given trading pairs on Balancer. Creators are rewarded for being the first to spin up a market for token X, which naturally attracts a greater variety of long-tail tokens to the platform.
* **Incentivize profitable investment vehicles on Balancer.** Similarly, pool creators would now be incentivized to create the “best” possible pools for LPs. Whoever arrives at the most profitable pool architecture for a given set of tokens will be well rewarded. In a way, this is similar to how Yearn incentivizes the creation of strategies on its platform; a liquidity pool, from an LP’s perspective, is a profit maximization “strategy.”
* **Incentivize more active pool management.** If rev share is paid to pool owners, who often have authority to modify pool parameters like swap fees and amplification coefficients, then this model incentivizes those owners to be more active in optimizing revenue flow through their pools. They should be constantly trying to maximize protocol fees generated by their pools, acting in a similar capacity to Gauntlet.
* **Outsource marketing to pool creators.** Anyone who stands to benefit from a given pool becoming more liquid has an implicit incentive to attract as many LPs as possible to that pool. Pool creators will be naturally inclined to spread the word about their pools and draw more attention to the Balancer protocol.

## Future Improvements

The items below have been casually discussed to differing extents. Pending further discussion, some may be proposed as subsequent additions to the model.

* Some form of veBAL staking/voting may be utilized in order to decide the amount of the rev share between a min and max value, e.g., 10% and 50%. This would completely remove any requirement of DAO involvement in designating high-value partnerships.
* The Balancer DAO could maintain a blocklist of pool factories for which rev share should be disabled; for example, ManagedPools have their own manager fees that accrue to the owner, so it does not make sense to share additional protocol fees with the owner.

## Summary

BAL is a governance token that has been successfully used to define important parameters of the Balancer ecosystem. The community believes that there is further room for improving the tokenomics of BAL and some sort of staking/locking should be implemented. Staking of BPT has already been proposed and approved by the community in the past[[1]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). The current proposal contains details of a concrete implementation of locking BPT. 

To avoid reinventing the wheel and spending additional time with non-core development, Curve's tokenomics[[2]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) seems an obvious fit for Balancer Protocol as well. It has been battle-tested with billions of dollars and attracted a thriving ecosystem around it. 

## **Core proposal**

Curve's ve (vote-escrowed) system will be used as an all-around solution for Balancer protocol tokenomics, solving at once a few outstanding problems the Balancer ecosystem currently has:

- BAL minting is not automated and the inflation schedule is not yet locked forever. This reduces predictability and trust in the overall system.
- BAL holders do not have any direct power over how BAL liquidity mining gets distributed.
- Lack of a mechanism for distribution of protocol level fees, which have recently been approved by governance[[3]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xf6238d70f45f4dacfc39dd6c2d15d2505339b487bbfe014457eba1d7e4d603e3).

Instead of pure BAL, BPT of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool[[4]](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56000200000000000000000014) will be locked into veBAL, similar to how CRV can be locked into veCRV. This has the big advantage of keeping BAL liquid as well as setting a precedent for other teams to do the same with their 80/20 Balancer pools. Alternatives to veBAL have been considered, like vebptBAL. The simplicity of veBAL — even though what is locked is not pure BAL — has however been the preferred option.

### veBAL and governance power

All votes, onchain or on snapshot, will be done considering veBAL balances instead of BAL balances as happens today. This ensures long-term alignment as only users locking BPT will have a say in Balancer's governance.

To get veBAL, anyone will be able to lock BPT of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool for any amount of time between 1 week and 1 year. Notice this is a change from the max duration of 4 years initially proposed in [[1]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). This is proposed to allow for an eventual migration to a new governance system with a wait time of 1 year instead of 4. Of course this migration can only happen if the veBAL governance approves it.

After locking the 80/20 BAL/ETH BPT, the user will have a non-zero balance of veBAL and will be able to help govern Balancer protocol, also benefiting from other parts of the new tokenomics system as described in more detail below.

### New proposed BAL inflation schedule

The current BAL supply today (as of Jan 27th) is **47,470,000 BAL**. This includes BAL that is being vested by early stakeholders, the fundraising fund and the ecosystem fund. Please refer to the BAL launch medium post[[5]](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/bal-is-live-104ba56e1945) for more details. 

Since the launch of BAL, the inflation has been a constant 145,000 BAL per week. To change that and make the Balancer ecosystem more sustainable, a new inflation schedule is proposed. Every 4 years the inflation should be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL supply of about **94,000,000 BAL.** A more detailed calculation can be seen on this public spreadsheet[[6]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FY0gi596YWBOTeu_mrxhWcdF74SwKMNhmu0qJVgs0KI/edit?usp=sharing).

This new inflation schedule will be immutable.

### Onchain Gauge System to determine Liquidity Mining distribution

Currently, liquidity mining is done via a tier system approved by the community[[7]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-balancer-v2-liquidity-mining-program/1678). The distribution is fixed for tier 1 slots (it can only be changed via governance vote) totaling 60k BAL. The remaining slots are allocated by the Liquidity Mining committee, which is part of the Partnerships subDAO[[8]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/draft-proposal-balancer-subdaos-formation/2428). BAL token holders have no direct say in which pools receive BAL from liquidity mining.

In the new system, however, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim BAL from liquidity mining. 

The amount received by each LP will depend on:

- how much the pool they are providing liquidity to receives
- what share of the pool's liquidity they have
- the boost applied to their LP share based on how much veBAL they hold[[9]](https://resources.curve.fi/guides/boosting-your-crv-rewards#formula)

Each pool receives a share of the total BAL minted every week. That share is defined by how much veBAL voted for that pool.

### Gauge types

There are different gauge types that are used in the ve system, each type gets a fixed percentage of the BAL supply minted weekly. Within each gauge type there can be many gauges that share the amount of BAL sent to that gauge type. The following gauge types and weights are proposed:

1. Liquidity Mining committee: 10% (14,500 BAL)
2. veBAL: 10% (14,500 BAL)
3. Ethereum mainnet pools: 56% (81,200 BAL)
4. Polygon pools: 17% (24,650 BAL)
5. Arbitrum pools: 7% (10,150 BAL)

New gauge types can be added and the weights/percentages of all gauge types can be changed by governance. These changes are however not expected to happen frequently. 

Gauge type 1) is an allowance for the Liquidity Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from receiving it).

Gauge type 2) is BAL that will be distributed to veBAL holders, similarly to LM that is distributed today to LPs of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent loss risk of LPing. 

Gauges 3, 4 and 5 will be LM that is distributed to mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum according to the veBAL voting power each pool gauge receives from veBAL holders.

### Initial gauges

In order to avoid the governance overhead of voting on adding dozens of initial gauges, all pools that will be receiving liquidity mining at the moment of system activation will be allowlisted. This however does NOT mean that they will have an initial percentage of LM. This will be defined by veBAL voting power.

### Protocol revenue distribution

75% of protocol revenues collected by the protocol fee collector[[10]](https://docs.balancer.fi/getting-started/faqs/fees) will be distributed to veBAL holders. The other 25% of the fees will be kept by the DAO treasury as a reserve. This has been suggested by many thought leaders like Hasu, on his New Mental Model for DeFi Treasuries[[11]](https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/). 

Given Balancer protocol is permissionless and meant to have thousands of pools, fees are going to be collected in potentially thousands of different tokens. Some type of consolidation will be necessary for the fees to be claimable by veBAL holders in a meaningful, gas-efficient way. The fee consolidation prior to distribution will initially be handled by the treasury subDAO, but should be replaced in the near future by a fully decentralized smart contract implementation, akin to Curve's burner contracts[[12]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html).

### Upgrading the system

Like with Curve, the system will not be upgradeable. In case the veBAL governance decides for a new system, the way to implement it would be to abandon the current system and direct minted BAL to the new system. This can only be done with a 1-year time delay, which ensures that anyone locking BPT for the longest duration possible will have the opportunity to withdraw their BPT before the minter points elsewhere.

The inflation schedule however will NOT be upgradeable and will be fixed forever.

### Benefits

Beyond increasing the overall predictability of Balancer Protocol and the BAL governance token as mentioned above, there are many other benefits worth mentioning: 

- **Long-term alignment.** By locking BPT, token holders will be encouraged to support Balancer over the long-term instead of speculating short-term.
- **Plug&play compatibility with Curve's ecosystem.** Curve has achieved tremendous success with a thriving ecosystem built around their ve tokenomics. By using the same system we make it trivial for teams like Yearn, Element, Convex and so many others to become part of Balancer's ecosystem too.
- **Developer time/effort saved for core Balancer work.** Tokenomics is super important but it is not what makes Balancer (or any other protocol for that matter) unique: precious development time should be focused on pool primitives and making Balancer easier to integrate with. Only this will help Balancer achieve the vision of becoming the leading liquidity platform for others to build on top.
- **Motivation for other DAOs to take a position in Balancer beyond just token-swaps.** It has become common for DAOs and protocols to purchase CRV in the open market to make sure they have a say in the Curve Wars. By having protocols aligned with Balancer longer term we expect utility and usage of Balancer to increase as well.

### Alternatives considered

- Launching our own staking contracts (which are ready and audited but don't solve all the problems that this proposal does).
- Using mStable rewards distributor or a variation of it.
- Keeping status-quo.

## **Risk assessment/mitigation**

1. **Immutability of the system will likely be a problem at some point in the distant future:** It's impossible to be at the same time predictable and upgradeable, so the trade-off chosen was that the system itself cannot be changed, but veBAL governance can choose to direct BAL inflation to a new system with a minimum 1-year delay. This is not expected to happen any time soon, but as things change hyper fast in this space, this system will likely not be the best option in say 5 years from now.
2. **Platforms built on top (like Convex on Curve) can take over control with central points of failure.** We expect veBAL governance to consider single point of failures for projects that apply to have their smart contracts be allowlisted for locking BPT. Ideally only projects which let token holders vote directly with their voting power (instead of delegating all their power to a multisig) will be approved.  

## Implementation

The main goal of the implementation is to change as little as possible from the battle-tested original Curve implementation. There could be some minor necessary technical changes that are necessary to adapt it to Balancer. The essence of this proposal or the parameters laid out however should not be changed.

## **Voting**

This proposal will be posted on the forum for 1 week prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting “Yes, let's do it” or “No, this is not the way”.

Thanks to everyone who contributed with feedback and suggestions, also thank you to Curve for having created this great tokenomics system and also to the Yearn community[[13]](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-65-evolving-yfi-tokenomics/11994) for inspiration for this proposal!

I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts and if you think anything proposed can be improved.

*This is a proposal authored by the Ops SubDAO - specifically Solarcurve, Mog, and mkflow.*

*A community call is scheduled for January 26th at 12pm EST in Balancer’s discord to discuss this proposal and answer any questions*

**Motivation**

After the successful passing of the recent [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66) to formalize the organization structure of Balancer DAO, each subDAO has hit the ground running in their respective areas. Beyond that, working groups like “Community Dev” also continue to be hard at work in service of the broader DAO.

This proposal is intended to outline the expected budget for Balancer DAO for the first quarter 2022. Please see a breakdown of compensation for February [here](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/5f9e713ac0c740b5bf57e778afad1599?v=150f8cdf222e4c9cb35a6200d0466159). Ops will take a very active role in ensuring compensation accurately reflects contribution efforts for all DAO participants so it is possible for changes to occur at any time. For the purposes of this proposal, we will estimate March compensation to be the same as February. For January, Grants subDAO is covered on their compensation from their previous funding proposal. The January total reflects compensation funding needs excluding Grants. 

**5,900 BAL for January + 6,800 BAL for February * 2 = 19,500 BAL total expected compensation.**

*Note that we will be running a DAO-wide Coordinape circle during February and March with an allocation of 2,000 BAL per month. This cost has graciously been offered as a gift from Fernando to the DAO, which we are very grateful for.*

Excluding compensation, please see a breakdown of the expected budget for Balancer DAO for he first quarter [here](https://balancergrants.notion.site/6ac72778504b4d6cad0541b3006e5b45?v=7d4a0ca953b54e5d889ce9fe15ae0a33). Ops will ensure an accurate record is kept of any disbursements - this will be presented as part of the next budget proposal so that token holders can make a more informed decision about the effectiveness of the DAO’s expenditures. A certain amount of good faith is required for now since there is not much of a record to judge currently.

**2,605 BAL for Q1 DAO Budget (excluding compensation)**

**Specification**

Ops will always custody compensation funds to ensure that we can fulfill our mandate and to alleviate the administrative burden from the rest of the DAO. Ops also has the option to custody general budget funds as well. Given that the budget requests are relatively small, the expense of creating new multisigs for each subDao and paying gas costs is not economical. Thus, Ops will custody both compensation and general budget funds for the first quarter.

If this proposal is approved, a transaction will be initiated from the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) to send 22,105 BAL to the Ops Multisig (0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325)","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[160307.25215898606, 95.95033683117556]",1

## Simple Summary
The partnership aims to align the interests of GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO, by increasing the collaboration between both organizations. The technical teams of both DAOs would carry out developments in the best interest of both organizations, such as completing [Stage 3](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1#:~:text=and%20better%20UX.-,Stage%203%20(Soon),-Balancer%2DGnosis%2DProtocol) of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer would then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found, eventually leading to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.

Also, joint marketing efforts will be made, together with a token swap, to align governance interests.

## Abstract
Even though GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO have common interests, their current level of collaboration and integration isn’t enough to achieve their common goals. A partnership agreement would be necessary to increase the depth and breadth of their joint efforts, improving coordination and resource allocation to common projects.

This improvement proposal has already passed phase 1 in both protocols:
https://forum.gnosis.io/t/treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/1440
https://balancergrants.notion.site/DAO-Agreement-Process-a871f46c41f043fd83bce34007eb14ab

## Motivation
We believe that achieving a greater synergy between BalancerDAO and GnosisDAO would significantly strengthen both organizations, allowing for a more efficient planning and execution of their joint projects, backed up by healthier treasuries, with increased token diversification.

## Specification
Both parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnership:

**Technical**
Joint work of technical teams of both DAOs to carry out developments in the best interest of both DAOs, such as completing Stage 3 of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer will then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found. This will eventually lead to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.

**Marketing**
To ensure both entities will profit from each other's reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where useful.

**Token Transaction**
To align governance interests, a Token Swap between the two organizations is initiated as part of this agreement.

200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of GNO in equal proportions from DAO Treasury, using the 90 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends.

Both organizations commit to holding the received assets for a period of at least 1 year. No on-chain logic will be implemented to ensure this.

## Rationale
Gnosis and Balancer have worked together for the past years. The protocols have [integrated Cowswap with Balancer V2](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1) to enable better gas prices and UX, MEV protection, no gas fees for failed transactions, better prices due to the optimized pool settlements and use of the Balancer v2 single vault architecture.

**Partnership Term**
The Partnership is open-ended and does not have an expiry date.

**Partnership Governance**
The partnership is managed by representatives of the organizations directed by the respective governance processes of the organizations. In the case of this partnership, there are 2 representatives for each organization.

**Exit Clause**
Both organizations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.

**Communications around the Partnership**
- A Partnership announcement blog will be created within the 2 weeks following the agreement date.

- To ensure operational effectiveness, a monthly call will be set up with at least one representative of each entity

Both DAOs acknowledge that DAO agreements are inherently unpredictable and irreversible and agree to this initial partnership agreement.

## Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would initiate a transaction to send 200,000 BAL to GnosisDAO (0x849d52316331967b6ff1198e5e32a0eb168d039d)

GnosisDAO will send the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) 9051 GNO in exchange. ","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[131806.771359027, 2.658500035533143]",1

**Background**

It has been roughly 8 months since the original liquidity mining [framework](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmeCrSe5xL5YWB17TjxAofYi3QnBMyHCYqufD8t3Zonj4S) was officialy set into motion. The structure that the program put into place was necessary at the time since the liquidity mining committee was just being formed. However its tiered system is very rigid and that rigidity causes some inherent challenges when it comes to divvying up liquidity across many pools with varying TVL.

The liquidity mining committee and business development teams have been working hard to onboard new strategic partners. Due to this influx of new projects it is becoming increasingly difficult to allocate incentives to new pools without impacting other pools in a meaningful way. This is due to the sizable changes in BAL between tiers. We’ve seen over the past few months that smaller incentive changes lead to better pool retention. As a reminder these are the existing tiers:

Tier 1: 15,000 BAL (4 slots, total of 60k BAL per week)
Tier 2: 5,000 BAL (9 slots, total of 45k BAL per week)
Tier 3: 2,500 BAL (12 slots, total of 30k BAL per week)
Tier 4: 1,000 BAL (10 slots, total of 10k BAL per week)

As you can see above it is a ~70% drop from Tier 1 to Tier 2, 50% drop from Tier 2 to Tier 3, and a 60% drop from Tier 3 to Tier 4. Current setup constraints in BAL allocation do not allow an efficient incentive model for prospective partners of numerous sizes.

As you may remember there were already two governance votes to switch to a more flexible model, those decisions proved to be successful and allowed the Liquidity Mining Committee to tailor specific allocations to projects depending on pool sizes:

* Introduction of Tier 4 to add flexibility ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmWiYnwdDynSJ66rt949E5nifh3CtYX6zYxTviiFMbXu3R))
* Moving Polygon to a fully flexible allocation model ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmQiatrqfsNZ4eSPCwBwaujBujwzhu2QqHEBSHqEoXs8g5))

This proposal moves even further in that direction by giving the Liquidity Mining Committee additional flexibility on both Main Net and Arbitrum.


**Proposal**

* Keep Tier 1 in place (no changes), any changes to pools in this tier would still require a governance vote.
* Dissolve Tier 2, 3, and 4 distribution model on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum and move to the flexible allocation model that exists on Polygon today. This change will provide the liquidity committee flexibility to allocate the 41,500 BAL ($726,000) on Ethereum mainnet and 8,500 BAL ($148,000) on Arbiturm.

This increased flexibility will allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to “right size” the incentives for respective pools. This change will ultimately lead to a better BAL per TVL allocation and spread liquidity across many places.

As a real world example let’s take a look at the LINK/WETH pool that is currently allocated 2,500 BAL. If the Liquidity Committee felt that the BAL allocation was better served elsewhere the pool would be cut by 1,500 BAL if dropped to the next tier. The APR for that pool would drop from ~12% to ~5%. Instead, what if you could trim the BAL by 200, 300, 500, etc. This freedom of flexibility will empower the Liquidity Committee with the ability to “spread the wealth” across our many partners. This change will also allow the Balancer platform to take a step towards a Curve gauge like system in the future if that is ultimately a desire of the community.

There are no suggested incentive changes for any pools as part of this proposal.


**Risks**

We see no greater risk that Liquidity Committee members could mis-manage rewards than they could with the current structure.

Governance would continue to have the power to halt the powers of the committee at any time, or remove members from the committee if it deemed such an action appropriate. The need for committee votes to pass changes each week would provide several days for governance to intervene, were such an intervention deemed necessary.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[162704.76887795335, 0]",1

*This proposal is the culmination of a lot of hard work across the Balancer Community, with a special shout out needing to go to the Ballers. They have especially shaped this vision for BalancerDAO’s future, through their commitment, effort and belief in the protocol!*

**BACKGROUND**

Balancer DAO has grown organically, with interested contributors stepping up and helping out where they saw fit. Up to this point, this approach to DAO organization has been successful. However, in order to continue to develop a sustainable, self-executing organization as the DAO grows, a more formal structure is proposed.

**CORE PROPOSAL - subDAO Formation**

This proposal is for the inclusion of subDAOs into the existing DAO organization structure going forward.

subDAOs are autonomous groups of contributors empowered by BAL holders to act independently in the best interest of Balancer, within a certain area, with clearly defined decision making powers. subDAOs will have plenty of support from the rest of the DAO and the community itself. It is important to note that contributors are not required to be BAL holders themselves.

The motivation behind establishing the subDAOs is to manage DAO-related decision making in a way that facilitates execution, without the need for every initiative or decision of the DAO to be passed as a proposal.

**subDAO Contributors**

Within a subDAO, there are three kinds of contributors:

* Signer (responsible for executing decisions)
* Members (active contributors doing work)
* Observers (contributors who don't do much work - e.g. BAL holders)

**Accountability:**

* The Signers of each subDAO are accountable to all contributors of the subDAO.
* Ops subDAO is responsible for connection between each working group and provides community interface through reporting of working group progress, milestones and initiatives.
* Ops will formally approve whenever a Signer is added or removed from a subDAO, though it is likely that subDAO has the most visibility into who among the contributors would make a good leader. It should not be Ops making a unilateral decision, but the Signers are ultimately accountable to Ops and Ops is accountable to BAL token holders.
* The Community is responsible for holding the Ops subDAO accountable to reporting and communication transparency.

**Notes:**

* Non-signers can weigh in, do work, or make proposals but only the signers decide on taking action.
* Social consensus means signers will decide through an off-chain process within their team - it can be as simple as yes/no in the chat.

**subDAO Formation Guidelines:**

* A minimum of three Signers are required and are to be identified for the subDAO
* subDAO powers are to be clearly defined, as these responsibilities are to be delegated by the BAL holders (wider community).
* Decision making processes/frameworks are to be defined in a clear and transparent manner
* Within each subDAO there should be one clear Point of Contact (POC) for external inbound enquiries
* Optional: quarterly budget are to be developed and must include sufficient justification

The above guidelines can be considered as the minimum requirement for creation of a new subDAO: Future new subDAO will be required to present a proposal to BAL token holders outlining each of the above points.

**subDAO Dissolution Guidelines:**

* A subDAO can be dissolved through development of a Proposal requesting the dissolution of the subDAO/s
* If an active proposal is put forward to dissolve a subDAO, all subDAO funds are to be frozen with immediate effect, pending the outcome of the vote.
* If the dissolution Proposal passes, all unspent subDAO funds from that cycle must be returned immediately to the DAO treasury.

**DAO STRUCTURE**

We propose the following initial structure as part of this proposal.

Any responsibilities not designated under the subDAO falls into the category of Working Groups and exist within the wider Balancer DAO (e.g. community support and community development).
Working groups are defined as: A group of contributors working together on a shared goal. Their formation does not need to be blessed or approved by anyone.
Working groups operate by:

* A “Working group"" starts when someone/a group decides to work on something that will benefit the DAO.
* Working groups do NOT have any powers delegated to them from BAL holders.
* Compensation of working group contribution is handled by the Ops subDAO through balleries and coorindape circles.

**DAO STRUCTURE**

We propose the following initial structure as part of this proposal.

**Cycles**

subDAOs operate on quarterly cycles ( starting 1 January, 1 April, 1 July, 1 Oct). Quarterly cycles are used for budget allocation, reporting, goal setting and alignment across the DAO.

A learnings and review document will be created by each funded subDAO at the end of each cycle. These documents will be compiled into one document by the Ops subDAO for posting on the forum. Any unspent resources at the end of the cycle can be rolled over as part of the budget allocation for the next cycle.

**Examples:**

Proposal Template:

Budget Breakdown:

|Item|Amount in BAL|Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|100 |compensation|
|2|200|events|
|**Total**|**300 BAL**||

**RISK ASSESSMENT/MITIGATION**

1. subDAO’s not held accountable

subDAOs could be formed that don’t generate any progress/ complete any work. Each subDAO is therefore responsible for creating a learning/review documents for presentation to the community at the end of each cycle, informing them of:

* Work completed
* Budget spend
* Learning for next cycle
* Planning undertaken

The report will provide the foundation for the subDAO being funded for the next cycle.

2. subDAO’s operating outside of delegated responsibilities

Any change to existing responsibilities ratified through this initial proposal will require the subDAO to present a Proposal to the community.

**CONSIDERATIONS**

1. The Grants subDAO and the DAO Multisig already exists within current Balancer DAO operations and their management practices won’t change.

2. Decisions made by subDAO teams that require on-chain execution will still be performed by a multisig.

3. It's important to note these subDAOs are not the only ones who can contribute to Balancer DAO. As needs arise or contributors step forward, new teams can and will form in the future. Any individual or group can contribute to Balancer DAO outside of the formalized teams.

4. There is agreement that formation of a Treasury subDAO is required to optimize management of DAO’s treasury funds. This task requires a significant amount of evaluation, analysis and strategy. It is therefore proposed that the Treasury subDAO responsibilities will be restricted at the beginning, to allow further time to develop the underlying treasury framework. Future treasury function could include:

* Tokenomics
*  Reinvestment
*  Diversification

5. Delegating any new responsibilities (not listed in this proposal) into any of the subDAOs will require a new Proposal to be developed.

**IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**

* Dec 2021 - Present draft subDAO proposal to community
* Jan 2022 - Consolidate proposal feedback and post final Proposal + Vote
* Feb 2022 - Structure + Budgets Live

It is proposed that the initial subDAOs (listed above) take full effect from 1 February 2022. This will allow a 2 month window for subDAO processes to be tested and refined before starting a quarterly cycle beginning 1 April 2022.

**VOTING**

This proposal will be posted on the forum for 1 week prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting “Yes, let's do it” or “No, this is not the way”.

Voting “Yes, let's do it” on this proposal means you support:

## What is Tempus?

Tempus is a fixed-rate protocol built on the Ethereum network. 

Tempus enables users to:

* Earn a fixed yield on their yield-bearing tokens (e.g. stETH, cDAI).
* Earn additional yield by depositing yield-bearing tokens to the various liquidity pools that are available on Tempus.
* Speculate and obtain leverage on future yield.

Tempus has received a $50,000 grant from Balancer Grants DAO to build a custom AMM that makes it more efficient to trade tokens with a known correlation (adjusted for time). Tempus is going live on Ethereum Mainnet on Wednesday 15 December 2021.

## Background

Recently, @Xeonus introduced a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-activation-of-the-protocol-fee-to-grow-the-balancer-dao/2304) to activate a “protocol fee” on Balancer which was subsequently [approved](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xf6238d70f45f4dacfc39dd6c2d15d2505339b487bbfe014457eba1d7e4d603e3) by the community.

While this protocol fee does not immediately impact third-party pools, we wanted to discuss how this “protocol fee” could be implemented in respect of Tempus.

Protocol fees are normally collected as a percentage of the swap fee in the custom AMM deployed on Balancer. However, this would be counterintuitive for a variety of reasons:

* Tempus is not a DEX, but a fixed-rate and future yield tokenization protocol where the AMM serves as a tool to indicate market implied yield.

* Tempus has the ability to implement all different kinds of fees (deposit, redemption, early redemption, swap and performance fees). Swap fees (that will be set to 0% in the future, and replaced by other fees) represent a small part of the revenues and isn’t representative of usage of the protocol.

* Tempus is not charging any protocol fees right now; that is why implementing an arbitrary protocol fee (whether as a swap fee in the AMM or otherwise) would hinder the adoption of the protocol and the bootstrapping of liquidity.

* If we apply a protocol fee in respect of swap fees in the TempusAMM, these protocol fees would start accruing in the form of our newly created primitives, Principals and Yields. It would add a lot of administrative and technical overhead on both sides to monitor the maturity date of each Tempus pool, and promptly redeem them (otherwise they will start losing value) using the DAO’s 6-of-11 multisig.

In addition, it is worth noting that Tempus doesn’t benefit from Balancer’s features in the same way as other projects building on top of Balancer:

* Tempus utilizes a custom version of the StableSwap implementation on Balancer (third-party pool) that uses a forked Vault, which doesn’t allow for any straight fee collection mechanism by Balancer DAO.

* Tempus can’t tap into the liquidity of Balancer’s Vault, since Tempus is built on a single AMM that allows trading between Principals and Yields only. There is no pair involving a stablecoin (e.g. USDC) or the underlying (ETH). We have no plans in place to set up new trading pairs as they are not necessary due to our protocol design and doing so would only fragment liquidity.

* Tempus doesn’t need its Principals and Yields to be tradable on Balancer’s frontend, as it is a closed system, and trading between these tokens requires access to our valuation tools, which only Tempus’ frontend can provide.

## Proposal

We are of the opinion that in order to foster long-term collaboration between Tempus and Balancer, we need to put in place an alternative plan that takes into account what Tempus does, and better aligns the interests of Tempus and Balancer.

As such, we are proposing the following:

* On launch, Tempus LPs will not pay protocol fees to Balancer DAO.

* When Tempus begins to implement protocol fees (deposits, withdrawals etc.), in a pool that uses a TempusAMM deployed via Balancer’s StableSwap, Tempus will calculate 10% of the total fees accruing to Tempus Treasury / TEMP stakers in respect of that pool, and pay these to Balancer DAO in the form of TEMP tokens.

* In exchange for this, Balancer will continue to support Tempus on an on-going basis, foster its integration into the Balancer Ecosystem, provide it with technical and marketing support, and treat the project on an equal footing with its other partners.

## Why is this a better outcome than protocol fees for both parties involved?

* It removes the complications of having to redeem Principals and Yields via the 6-of-11 multisig each time a Tempus series matures.

* It aligns the long-term interests of Tempus and Balancer DAO as Balancer DAO will end up holding a small portion of TEMP and receive a corresponding amount of fees that’s reflective of our protocol usage.

* It gives Tempus the flexibility to put its users first, by implementing alternative fee structures that don’t include a swap fee. In other words, it gives certainty to Balancer DAO that it will continue to receive revenues in the absence of swap fees in the TempusAMM. In this case, Balancer DAO can also act in the best interest of the Tempus users and Tempus will not receive pushback from Balancer DAO if we want to phase out swap fees.

* It gives Balancer the ability to partner with and support Tempus in the long run, participate in governance and receive a share in its revenues using the newly accrued TEMP.

## TL;DR:

* Balancer DAO has activated a protocol fee in respect of their pools

* It is counterintuitive for both Tempus and Balancer to pay and receive fees in this form, given Tempus is not a DEX but a complex fixed-rate protocol

* When Tempus has fees (e.g. deposits, withdrawals, etc.) on a pool that uses a Balancer AMM, then 10% of the total fees would be calculated and Balancer DAO would be paid the equivalent in TEMP

* The community needs to decide whether they will accept this proposal as an alternative fee structure","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[133952.5409016058, 176.78460600473758]",1

Hi All, ZeKraken here, been posting on the forum for awhile, but first time submitting a proposal. Please let me know if you have any feedback on any of the below points.

## Motivation

As treasury swaps become more commonplace and now that the protocol fee has been turned on you should expect to see more yield farming activity coming from the Balancer DAO. In the vast majority of cases treasury assets should not just sit idly by, they should be put to work to earn yield while the tokens are in your possession. This is of course if the farming is done in a thoughtful, measured, and appropriate way.

## Investment Proposal

Below I outline the selected strategies for the FEI, TRIBE, and MTA that the Balancer DAO recently acquired through treasury swaps with those respective protocols.

### FEI / TRIBE:

2,454,000 FEI was acquired on Dec 9 2021, worth $2,448,559 at the time of this post

2,598,000 TRIBE was acquired on Dec 9 2021, worth $2,535,854 at the time of this post

ACTION: Deposit the full balance of both tokens to Rari Protocol’s Fuse platform- FeiRari [Fei DAO Pool](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/8) TVL - $171,405,955

ESTIMATED RETURN:
FEI - $81,292 (in FEI) annually based on 3.32% APY
TRIBE - $718,407 annually (in TRIBE) based on 28.33% APR
Total - $799,699 annually

### MTA:

334,000 MTA was acquired on Dec 14 2021, worth $297,714 at the time of this post

ACTIONS:
[Stake](https://staking.mstable.app/#/stake) the full balance of MTA on the mstable platform giving us an equal amount of vMTA. staked MTA TVL - $6,361,104

Vote on the [dials](https://staking.mstable.app/#/dials) page, giving 100% of the voting balance to the MTA/WMATIC/WETH Balancer Polygon pool. This will bring additional MTA staking rewards to Balancer’s LPs in the Polygon pool. Note: the Mainnet Balancer pool is already capped at 10%, so no vote will be made for that dial at this time

ESTIMATED RETURN:
$76,333 annually (in MTA) based on 25.64% APY

OTHER:
We will not delegate mstable governance voting rights at this time. Rather the Balancer DAO will maintain the right to vote where it sees fit

For more information about the mstable’s staking/voting process see this [link](https://medium.com/mstable/emissions-controller-guide-4ceaf16199ac)

## Risks

There are a few risks to highlight around the depositing of treasury held assets. By far the biggest risk is smart contract risk which could result in partial or total loss of assets. However we are choosing to deposit on highly reputable platforms.

One option to combat the smart contract risk would be to utilize cover from Nexus Mutual for the two protocols. Currently those rates are 2.6% annually for both Rari and mstable (rates subject to change).

Another potential risk is around a reduced return on investment of this proposal vs. other potential strategies. There may be other strategies that could be deployed, but more often than not a much greater return comes with more risks. We feel we can get a decent return with an acceptable amount of risk.

Disclaimer: all figures and estimated returns are subject to change with market conditions, these figures presented here serve as a snapshot in time.

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system** . The [BLabs Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B) will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power.

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused. In practice, after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed. In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered, Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds.

2. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `StablePhantomPool` factory ( `0xb08E16cFc07C684dAA2f93C70323BAdb2A6CBFd2` )

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions:

* Boosted Stable Pools ( `StablePhantomPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
  * token rate cache duration
* Boosted Linear Pools ( `AaveLinearPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * lower target
  * upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools, and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community.

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pool’s capital efficiency. If the duration is too long, the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache. A short duration mitigates this risk, with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades.

On Linear Pools, swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers, but rather act as an incentive for arbitragers/keepers to:

1. withdraw main tokens from the pool, deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess;
2. withdraw aTokens from the pool, withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens;

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens. A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool, which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range.

While we’re confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above. For this reason, this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters. Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action, but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers, acting on behalf of BAL holders. All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand.

## What is the protocol fee?
Balancer v2 imposes the possibility to activate the “protocol fee”. The protocol fee would collect a percentage of the pool fees and passively accumulate them over time. The fee can be set in a range between 0-50% of the pool fee. The protocol fee is currently set to 0%.

## Why should we activate protocol fees?
In the current state, the Balancer protocol provides around 145’000 BAL weekly in incentives across the protocol (on multiple chains) without asking for anything in return. To me this was mesmerizing when looking at the overall distribution of BAL and co-incentives across chains. This is a good way to bootstrap liquidity and distribute our governance token. However, to be a sustainable and most importantly innovative protocol, we also need to collect fees as a revenue stream. As we want to transition to a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), we need to think about its future and how to achieve that. The only way to be able to run a successful DAO is the availability of funds to sponsor future development and innovation of the protocol as the vision of Balancer Labs is to slowly transition from a core component to a contributor of the protocol.

## How will the protocol fees be utilized?
In an initial phase fees will simply be accrued in a treasury. There are many possibilities and opportunities to pursue once fees accumulate. The following non-exclusive list shall give you examples on what could be done with collected fees:

Create a DAO treasury index fund to secure liquidity and sustainability of the DAO
Buy back BAL and stake in the 80/20 pool
Distribute parts of the revenue to protocol participants e.g. LPs

Of course, all these examples would only be implemented after careful consideration and discussion with the community and snapshot votes!

## Partnership Purpose
The partnership aims to align the interest of the parties to intensify the collaboration between the organization. With PrimeDAOs relaunch, it seeks to further commit to the building on the Balancer Protocol and supporting the decentralization and development of the BalancerDAO.

The current Prime product suits, consisting of Prime Launch (LBP interface), Prime Rating (research sub-DAO), Prime Pools (DAO governed Balancer Pools) and Prime Deals (Interface for DAO agreements) aim to provide substantial value to BalancerDAO and aligned DAOs.

Commitment of the Organizations
Both parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnerships:

## D2D Collaboration

PrimeDAO’s primary aim is enabling D2D collaborations and shares this vision with Balancer. PrimeDAO will support the development of the BalancerDAO and, where possible, share learnings and resources with BalancerDAO.
BalancerDAO will get early access to Prime Deals 2, an Interface for DAO to DAO interactions, such as token swaps co-liquidity provision, and joint venture formation, to give input, to ensure the product serves the needs of BalancerDAO.

## Technical

PrimeDAO will continue to host Balancer LBP through Prime Launch and support the development of LBPs on Balancer.
PrimeDAOs builders will continue to support the development of the Balancer Protocol.
PrimeDAOs will support the development of the Balancer Protocol on alternative blockchains, currently evaluating the deployment of Balancer V2.0 on Celo and xDAI chain in collaboration with Symmetric, with the potential for it to develop into a Balancer Friendly Fork.

## Operational

Both DAOs will actively share DAO operational learnings and workflows, starting with a bi-monthly knowledge-sharing session covering three topics relevant to both DAOs. The first session will be organized in mid-January.

## Marketing

To ensure both entities will profit from each other’s reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.

## Co-liquidity provision:

To align governance interests, between the two organizations, the creation of a co-liquidity pool is proposed with the following details; 25,000 BAL from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund would be transferred to PrimeDAO at the end of PrimeDAO own LBP to bootstrap a PRIME / BAL pool with 50/50 weights and 2,5% trading fees. Right after the conclusion of the PRIME LBP, PrimeDAO will seed a pool with the 25,000 BAL and match it with the same $ value in Prime. Once the pool is initiated, PrimeDAO will transfer 50% of the Balancer Pool Tokens to the Balancer Ecosystem Fund to complete the transaction.

The pool will again be called the Balancer <> PRIME pool (BLxPR) and function as a liquidity bridge between the two DAOs. The BLxPR pool will be one of the two main liquidity pools for PrimeDAO.

## Governance

The BLxPR token will be added to the Snapshot strategies of both DAOs to allow BLxPR token holders to participate in the Governance of both protocols.
A new snapshot will be set-up with the BLxPR as the governing token. This snapshot will be used to govern issues related to this DAO agreement.

## Pool Optimization

PrimeDAO aims to create deep liquidity between BAL <> PRIME to be able to bring more projects and liquidity to the Balancer Protocol. PrimeDAO aims to do this by actively engaging in D2D agreement with other DAOs and creating PRIME / xxx pools on the Balancer Protocol.
PrimeDAO also aims to leverage the various upcoming Balancer Pools in combination with PrimeDAOs existing products. Prime Rating could potentially be utilized to create research-driven managed pools and Prime Deals could be connected to the Balancer Protocol to allow multiple DAOs to bootstrap a pool together in a completely permissionless way.

## Specification
At the end of the PrimeDAO LBP, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) will initiate a transaction to send 25,000 BAL to PrimeDAO (0x567d220B0169836cBF351DF70A9c517096ec9De7)

PrimeDAO will match that with an equal USD amount of PRIME to create the BAL<>PRIME pool and send the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) half the BPT's.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[397554.8604433829, 4657.673416217949]",1

Hi, Balancer community,

I’m Théo, core-contributor at mStable.

mStable is a Decentralised Stablecoin Ecosystem composed of a capital-efficient AMM and a high-yielding savings account product.
I am reaching out today to discuss a partnership opportunity arising from the upcoming launch of our Emission Controller.

## Context

mStable is about to release its version of the Gauge controller, inspired from Curve’s, which will dictate rewards distribution over the next 5 years (~35m MTA).

As we speak, two Balancer pools are receiving MTA rewards:

One on Mainet [MTA / WETH Balancer pool]
One on Polygon [MTA/WETH/WMATIC Balancer pool]
Balancer & mStable have been maintaining a long-standing relationship: mStable was one of the first user of Balancer in August 2020 and had the biggest pool at some point there.

## Opportunity

We thought it would be highly beneficial for Balancer to take on an MTA position and vote for those pools, thus directing higher rewards that will inevitably attract more liquidity to the pools.

This is an opportunity to go a step further with shared governance and treasury diversification while bringing significant extra TVL to Balancer. It is also a nice way to do a joint marketing campaign highlighting both protocols

## Specification

a) Swapped amounts and origination

-20k BAL against the equivalent USD value worth of MTA were agreed 
 upon for this swap
-MTA tokens would be sent from the mStable Treasury Asset 
 Management subDAO ( 
 0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179 ) to the Balancer -Treasury DAO ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f )
-BAL tokens would be sent from the Balancer Treasury DAO ( 
 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) to the mStable 
 Treasury Asset Management subDAO ( 
 0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179 )

b) Timeline and swap execution

This proposal will go to a Snapshot vote on the side of mStable on the 6th of December, and resolve on the 10th of December. Balancer voting will start at 7am EST Dec 6th, and resolve 7am EST Dec 10th so both protocols have the same voting window.

Swap execution: Tokens will be swapped on-chain if both votes are approved, and the 1 year holding time will begin at the time the tokens from the transfer enter the wallet of the corresponding DAO.

c) Pricing method and price feeds

It has been agreed to use a 30-days smooth average. The time window for the 30 days average would be from the 10th of November until the 10th of December 2021.

MTA Price feed: MTA/ USD (Chainlink) BAL Price feeds: BAL/USDT (Binance)","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[348586.35317223973, 2646.79741587235]",1

For some background on the governance multisig (hereafter referred to as the DAO multisig), you can check out [this section of the docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/multisig). 

## Motivation

Currently the Balancer DAO treasury is controlled by Balancer Labs - handing over direct control to the DAO is a key step in furthering decentralization of our operations.

To be clear, this proposal does not give the DAO multisig any decision making powers. Its sole responsibility is to enact legitimately passed snapshot votes.

The current list of signers is as follows:

Alexander Lange (Inflection)
Ash Egan (Accomplice)
Solarcurve (Baller)
Fabien (Snapshot Labs)
Jake Brukhman (CoinFund)
Kain Warwick (Synthetix)
Mariano Conti (Ethereum)
David Hoffman (Bankless)
Trent McConaghy (Ocean Protocol)
Cooper Turley (Fire-eyes)

Kevin Owocki (Gitcoin) will be retiring as a signer. We thank him for his service!

As part of this proposal a list of replacement candidates has been prepared. In the event a signer wishes to voluntarily leave, someone from this list may be chosen at the discretion of the DAO Multisig as a replacement. Any replacement will be announced in discord and the @Balancer twitter account.

Danielmk (BeethovenX)
Bakamoto (Baller - Head of Liquidity Mining committee)
Zeb (Balancer Grants DAO)
Evgeny Yurtaev (CEO at Zerion)
Hart Lambur (Co-founder at UMA)

Note that BAL holders retain the ability to replace DAO multisig signers at any time and no one can be added as a signer without the approval of BAL holders unless they appear on the above list. Having the candidate list is intended to ease the transition period so operations can continue seamlessly in the event several signers decide to leave abruptly.

Additionally, a stipend of 500 BAL every six months will be payable to DAO multisig signers. They are free to opt out of this if they desire. The stipend will be distributed at the end of each six month period. If a signer leaves before that, they are eligible to receive it prorated. The first period will begin upon the approval of this proposal.

## Specification
If approved, this proposal seeks to transfer control over Balancer DAO’s treasury funds, located at 0xb618f903ad1d00d6f7b92f5b0954dcdc056fc533, to the DAO multisig address 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f. All assets would be transferred by Balancer Labs to this new address.

Additionally, the DAO multisig signers would create a gnosis safe on Fantom to hold Balancer DAO’s allocation of BEETS as part of the recently passed friendly fork proposal. Note that in the future the DAO multisig could operate wallets on other networks as required by future friendly forks or other activities - these would not require governance votes but addresses and activities will always be public and transparent.

Finally, some BAL still remains allocated as part of past Grant waves. Balancer Labs will determine the exact amount but this is the reason not all BAL might be transferred over to the DAO multisig.

Before we dive into the details, we’d like to briefly introduce Beethoven X and the goals we hope to achieve.

Beethoven X is the latest symphonic composition from the undead master composer Ludwig van Beethoven. The music was formed over a 200 year reflection spent with a body decomposing in the nutritious soil and a heart and soul dancing among the stars and universes. The idea is simple; Build the best experience on Fantom, contribute to the entire ecosystem with everything we have in us, build creative highly effective edgy yield opportunities. When Beethoven lived the first time from 1770 - 1827 he was a rebellious creator of magnificent experiences that few people could follow. He was a true master, and now he is back; with his spiritually symphonic decentralised investment platform: Beethoven X. You can read more in this [Fantom Spotlight article](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-ecosystem-spotlight-beethoven-x/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=xkTxSQz34QjKbsVBfIgTqWZ.04YLYq7XnlvkXc9dW3E-1636051250-0-gaNycGzNCBE).

As a team, we strive to have well defined goals that drive our day to day efforts. As of now, those goals are clear:

-Become the #1 DEX on Fantom.
-Maximize the risk-adjusted return of more than 100.000 liquidity 
 providers.
-Maximise protocol revenue through constant experimentation and 
 optimisation in close collaboration with the community.

The team and community behind Beethoven X truly believe in our capacity to become the #1 DEX on Fantom. We believe the technology powering the Balancer V2 protocol is second to none, and our strategy is to showcase its potential in a developing ecosystem.



## Collaboration with Balancer

We believe that a portion of the Beethoven X protocol should be owned by both the BAL treasury and BAL holders, and so we’d propose that 5% of the total supply of BEETS should be allocated as follows:

-4% provided to the BAL treasury, with a six month cliff and two year linear vesting.
-1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows:
--A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders as of Nov 11, 
  2021.
--Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible
--A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT 
  holders on ETH mainnet
--A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 
  BPT holders
--A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, 
  USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT holders and BAL held in 
  the Qi Vault on polygon.
--To achieve a more equitable distribution of tokens, the tokens will be 
  distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value 
  of holdings.
--Any qualifying address will need to have at least $100 USD value 
  staked in a Beethoven X incentivized farm on Fantom Opera. A cutoff 
  date will be announced if the vote is passed.
--The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined 
  collaboratively between the Beethoven X team and the Ballers and 
  the requirements outlined here are **subject to small revisions**.

If you review our [tokenomics](https://docs.beethovenx.io/beets/tokenomics) and [emissions schedule](https://docs.beethovenx.io/beets/emission-schedule), you will see that 5% of our maximum supply is a significant portion of our current circulating supply. It also equates to over 70% of our available partnership fund. This is how strongly we believe in creating a lasting collaborative relationship between both communities and teams. We know that you are what Mozart was to Beethoven; The greatest source of inspiration and the original creator of a foundation to create incredible music from.

As we launched our token prior to the definition of the Friendly Fork model, the Ballers have agreed to a one time exclusion for Beethoven X. The percentages above are not reflective of the requirements for future Friendly Forks.

In exchange for the BEETS, BAL governance will recognize Beethoven X as the approved Friendly Fork on Fantom, and we’d propose that we co-compose creative ways to communicate the relationship.

The Beethoven X team will continue to search for avenues of collaboration with Balancer Labs. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to create tools and enhancements that could be easily integrated into the Balancer experience.

We truly hope that this is the starting point of a long lasting collaborative relationship.","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[481735.42460816127, 5.8715347610420725]",1

For reference, here’s the [current overview of our governance process.](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/governance-process)

In an effort to further decentralize, Balancer Labs is stepping away from the process and handing it over to the community. There’s three elements to the handoff:

1. Moving snapshot admin to a community representative

2. Ceding control of the snapshot ENS

3. Passing the burden of determining when soft consensus has been reached

I will present my suggestions for how the community moves forward on this. My goal is to start a dialogue so please do not hesitate to question anything and everything or offer up alternative ideas.

1. I have experience managing snapshot admin, so I humbly put myself forward as a volunteer to take the admin. I will remove the existing addresses capable of putting a proposal to snapshot and replace them with the addresses of the five full time Ballers - me, bakamoto, andrea, xeonus, and Mike B.

2. I suggest setting the governance multisig as controller of the ENS. The only function they will perform is changing the admin, which should not happen often if ever. This multisig contains many high profile and trusted names in the ethereum community and is the safest place to put the ENS in my opinion.

3. I propose creating a “gov council” of the five full time Ballers mentioned above. A majority vote in favor would be required before a proposal can be posted to snapshot. I can create a discord channel that is public read-only where the five of us will discuss if a proposal has reached soft consensus. It is extremely important to understand that it is not a question of if any of the five personally are in favor of a proposal, but that the community has reached a soft consensus to proceed. For example, if I personally oppose something but it is clear from forum discussion that most people are in favor, I would be obligated to vote in favor of the proposal going to snapshot.

Additionally, I suggest adding a requirement that each proposal include a forum poll as another signaling device we can use. It is gameable of course, but still a valuable input to have I think.

For a snapshot proposal to be considered valid & binding, it must be open for voting for at least three full days and announcements of the vote must be posted to the official @BalancerLabs Twitter account AND in the #announcements channel of Balancer’s discord. These announcements must be made with no less than 24 hours remaining in the vote.

Hi - Brianna here, core contributor at Fei Protocol. Fei has created a stablecoin that stabilizes itself through transparent on-chain reserves.

We recently announced [Fei v2](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/introducing-fei-v2-6f56afe7a1b5), introducing a way to algorithmically manage volatility risk through a custom Investment Pool using Balancer v2 platform. This has the potential to add Fei’s current PCV (currently $913M +) to the Balancer platform. Tribe Community is excited to team up with Balancer!

As Fei v2 implementation anticipates bringing significant TVL to Balancer, it would be beneficial for our communities to further our alignment through a Treasury swap.

Inspiration for this proposal came from our mutual friends at [Index Coop](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-treasury-swap-balancer-indexed/2188).

Benefits include:

-Treasury diversification into two assets (FEI, a stable asset, and TRIBE, with 
 governance rights and Protocol Controlled Value performance upside)
     -Balancer DAO is eligible to earn additional TRIBE by participating in Fei’s 
       incentivized staking programs (Uni v2, Rari, Curve, etc.)
-FEI would give Balancer stable assets in its Treasury
-Distributes tokens into the hands of a long-term ecosystem partner
-Governance power for DAO proposals

## Specification

200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of TRIBE and FEI in equal proportions from Fei DAO Treasury, using the 20 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends. Currently 1 BAL = 22.49 FEI = 34.33 TRIBE. Price feed will be BAL/USDT (Binance) and TRIBE/FEI (Uni-V2) FEI/ETH (Uni-V2)

Fei DAO will deposit BAL into BAL/WETH 80/20 paired with ETH from the PCV and commits to holding for the long run. The Fei DAO will also be eligible to earn BAL rewards, which will be further held by Fei and possibly reinvested in the 80/20 BAL/WETH pool.

## Context
In one of the baller calls, the @balancer Twitter handle came up and the ballers nominated Reptile Presidente (who currently runs the Balancer Intern handle) to run the @balancer handle on behalf of the community.
## The Proposal
Appoint Reptile Presidente as the spokesperson to run the @balancer Twitter account on behalf of the community.

Reptile Presidente will have a responsibility to the community to uphold the brand & the community has the right to remove ownership if they deem it the responsibility is not being met.

The ballers have the authority to replace the spokesperson for any reason and the spokesperson agrees to promptly adhere with any such vote before any appointment is effective.

The spokesperson agrees to abide by all Twitter account requirements and applicable laws. All posts will be factually accurate and endeavor to create a positive reputation for the community as designated.
## Mission
A spokesperson is designated for the following purpose:

-To represent the community interests.
-To promote community identified topics.
-Thought leadership for defi.
-Decentralize communication channels for the Balancer Protocol.

The @balancerlabs account is a representative of BLabs. The @balancer twitter should be a representative of the Balancer Community.

The new account would still uphold the brand standard but would be a community initiative. As a result we would aim to publish:

-Educational threads on Balancer Protocol and all its features.
-Educational threads on projects built on top of Balancer Protocol.
-Fun social campaigns.
-More content for DeFi Degens.
-Providing some extra support.
-More content around liquidity mining, LBPs.
-Promoting governance votes.

A spokesperson agrees to avoid the following:

-To participate in or encourage manipulation of any market or asset transactions.
-To participate in or encourage any fraudulent or illegal activity.
-To defame any individuals or companies/organizations.
-Post on the Twitter account for one’s personal interest(s) instead of for the -community’s interest(s).","[""Yes, let's do it"", 'No, this is not the way']","[195927.58862695371, 0]",1

Alchemist are the awesome team behind Copper Launch, which utilises Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools to function. In the last couple of months, their project has helped drive more than $70m in trade volume through Balancer pools, and Balancer has successfully retained liquidity for the GRO project after its LBP on Copper. GRO has consistently been in the top few highest volume Balancer pools on ETH mainnet since its 80/20 pool was deployed.

Separate to Copper Launch, the Alchemist team have developed Crucible: an innovative smart contract wallet, which enables users to subscribe to reward programs & store their tokens securely within an NFT container.

When an LBP is completed, a key objective for Balancer is to retain the token’s liquidity on an ongoing basis, so we become the primary liquidity for their token. Alchemist have proposed building out a feature which allows LBPs to convert into a standard Weighted Pool after launch, with rewards issued via their Crucible product.

In order to retain these pools after an LBP, we need a mechanism to be able to issue BAL rewards via Crucible, otherwise projects are liable to migrate to competitors who do offer rewards instead. In exchange for providing BAL rewards, Alchemist will offer Balancer as the only exchange to do a migration to after an LBP, within the Copper Launch UI.

## Specification
The liquidity mining committee proposes that we run a 12 week trial, with Alchemist granted 2,500 BAL per week from Balancer’s Ecosystem Fund, to distribute via their own reward programs, exclusively for projects which run LBPs.

Alchemist will work with LBP projects to design appropriate reward programs, and each reward program BAL is used to incentivise will be matched by at least an equivalent $ value in the project’s token (taken as the average sales price during the LBP for the LBP project’s token, and a 7 day TWAP for BAL).

The liquidity mining committee will retain the power to veto:
* Rewards for any post-LBP projects it believes may be a direct competitor to Balancer, or established to undermine Balancer in any way.
* Rewards for any project it believes is not high enough quality to warrant BAL rewards.
* Rewards for any project where the amount of BAL is deemed to be excessive, given the amount of liquidity likely to be attracted to Balancer by the program.

30,000 BAL will be distributed from the ecosystem fund to a 3-of-5 multisig wallet, with solarcurve, bakamoto, andrea, mike b & xeonus (fulltime Ballers) as signers, which can then be allocated on to crucible reward programs each week.

The 2,500 BAL distributed each week does not need to be used immediately by Alchemist, and will accrue for distribution in future weeks if left unused. The program will continue for 12 weeks or until the full 30,000 BAL is distributed, whichever takes longest.

## Dependencies
None.
## Risk Assessment
The primary risk is that Alchemist mis-use the BAL. As a team committed to building for the long term, and as an important partner building on top of Balancer V2 which will want to secure rewards in the future, I see this risk as low. The 3 of 5 multisig wallet would be used as a mechanism to ensure any single rogue actor could not divert the funds intended for this program.

This draft has been created by the committee of the Balancer Grants DAO. See its previous proposal for establishing this committee [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095).

## Summary
This proposal aims to fund the next cycle (Nov 1st - January 31st) of Balancer Grants DAO. The upcoming program will further accelerate the development of the Balancer ecosystem by improving coordination around Grants, RFPs and Ventures.

The requested budget for this next cycle (3 months) is 50,000 BAL. Similar to the first Balancer Grants DAO proposal, a learnings and review end report will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.

The Balancer Grants committee has already worked together during the first 3 month’s cycle. To maintain continuity and support for the grants that are still running, and the applicants that have applied, we want to have the proposal for the next cycle up and ready on time. The first round has been a success and shows the need and the potential for a bigger Balancer Ecosystem. To get a better idea of what has been done, check out our monthly reports on the [Balancer Community Notion](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Grants-Updates-404ae3750a084de78116cb899b17e2b9). An end report for cycle 1 is being finalized and will be published at the end of the current cycle, which is running until the 31st of October.

From the beginning we have looked at this first round as a time of learning and iterating, building on what works and leaving behind what is useless. With this in mind, the committee requested a lower amount than is often given to grant programs within the crypto space. Now that the committee and the Balancer community is aware of these learning points, the following rounds will no doubt go even smoother than this round already went.

## Impact
Looking back on the first cycle, we can say with confidence that the program has been a success. The program has been able to pull in multiple promising and established DeFi projects into the Balancer Ecosystem. To build long term relationships and grow Balancer’s TVL were the main objectives, and the program is clearly delivering. We as a committee have identified multiple opportunities when it comes to ecosystem building and want to act upon these in the next cycle.

Establishing well-aligned yet autonomous units within the Balancer Ecosystem aligns with Balancer’s Decentralization and Ecosystem strategy. Having multiple entities co-develop the Balancer ecosystem creates value-add opportunities and allows the separate entities to specialize further.

## PROPOSAL
We propose some small changes to the current setup of the grants program, and advocate to further the decentralization of the BalancerDAO. We believe this can be done through multiple committees, initially funded by the Balancer Grants DAO. We understand that this is a slow and long process, so this will be a learning experience where we want to plant the seeds for the future.

The grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD $75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.

The RFP (bounty) program provides rewards for completion of key tasks identified by the Balancer community. It’s the easiest way for anyone to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. RFPs can be either technical or non-technical and vary in reward size depending on the required skill set and time needed to complete.

The venture program aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem and further align incentives with ecosystem partners through partnership agreements, token swaps and DAO2DAO ventures. We propose to start this off with a Venture Lead role who will be actively building out these types of deals and structures. With the actual outcomes going to the forum and being voted upon by the community. To support this opportunity, it needs some firepower and a dedicated role plus support can bring that.

The end-goal of the complete program is to attract and retain talent and resources to the Balancer ecosystem.

## Introduction
For those who don’t know, the Ballers are a group of long term community contributors to Balancer Protocol. This proposal will feature messages from the Ballers about their activities to give the community some context around analyzing the value of this proposal. Under the current framework the Baller program is being funded in three month increments. Our current round of funding is set to expire November 1st, 2021. Over the last few months, the program has grown significantly in member count and scope. Commensurate with this growth is an increase in the funding cost. Currently the Ballers operate with no hierarchy - it is up to each Baller to determine their level of “Ballery” (full or half or none) and their level of engagement.

I have taken the role of distributing the Ballery so I check in with each Baller every month to see what they’re up to and if they have any feedback/concerns. We’ve also adopted bi-weekly Baller Round Table meetings to better coordinate amongst ourselves. I asked each Baller to write up a bit about what they’ve been doing recently so the community has some context to frame the discussion around this proposal - note this was up to each Baller to determine if they wanted to write anything or not.

You can see the list of currently active Ballers [here](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d). This is updated to be reflective of the next three months.

Notable changes compared to the previous three months: Tongnk is going from half Ballery to none as he’s primarily focused on grants where he’s directly compensated. Andrea, Mike B, and Xeonus are moving from half to full as the scale of their contributions have increased.

## Baller Active Roles & Contributions

Please see the forum post referenced at the top of this proposal. This section was too large to fit in the snapshot vote.

## Conclusion & Specification
With a proposed roster of thirteen active Ballers (five full, eight half) at the current rate of 500 BAL per month for full and 250 BAL per month for half with 60% fully unlocked after two years (1 year cliff, 1 year linear vesting) and 40% liquid immediately, the total cost of funding for the next three months is as follows.

1,800 BAL per month in liquid payments * 3 = 5,400 BAL
2,700 BAL per month in vested payments * 3 = 8,100 BAL

In addition, I request 300 BAL as a spending fund to reward notable community contributions and fund any small projects the Ballers might need funding for.

#### Total: 13,800 BAL

If approved, the ecosystem fund will distribute this amount to a wallet I control. The Ballers desire to re-use existing vesting contracts, so the vested amounts for each Baller would be fully released in October 2023. I will work with Mike McDonald to make a contract for any Baller who does not have an existing vesting contract with a fully vested date that matches the existing ones.","['Renew Funding for the Ballers', 'Do not renew funding']","[446728.2017368316, 9593.34654067137]",1

## Background
The BAL for Gas initiative was introduced as a measure to entice and help users interested in trading ERC-20 tokens through the Balancer trading platform.

The introduction of the Gnosis partnership, however, will allow users to trade without requiring ETH for gas, so the gas reimbursement program becomes obsolete.

The initial proposal by @rabmarut can be found [here.](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705)
The V2 Bal for Gas proposal by @rabmarut can be found [here.](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-bal-for-gas-on-balancer-v2/1861)

## Core Proposal
Given the conditions outlined above, I propose stopping this initiative with immediate effect.

## Risk Assessment
The halting of this program might result in a reduction in trading activity, from those first-time users not familiar with Balancer inner mechanisms (claiming function and Gnosis).

## Open Questions
This proposal does not impact the general long term vision of the protocol

Balancer began distributing POAPs back in August, making us one of the earliest adopters in DeFi. Through the connections I've made since then I was made aware of the upcoming Poapathon [https://www.poapathon.com/](https://www.poapathon.com/).

By sponsoring this event we send a message to the rapidly growing community around POAPs that Balancer believes in the future of the technology. We will get access to some of the top artists and designers in crypto. I anticipate a lot of positive PR around this event, which means positive PR for Balancer if we become a top sponsor. 

## Motivation

Community engagement is critically important to the growth of any crypto project. Adopting POAPs and starting the AMA series have been effective first steps but there is still a lot left to do. Sponsoring this event will solidify Balancer's leadership position in the POAP community - the connections/PR we'll generate could be very important in the future. I will do my best to create as much value for Balancer as possible through our sponsorship and welcome the help of any other Ballers who are interested. 

## Specification

You can see the sponsorship tiers [here](https://www.poapathon.com/sponsors). This event is still in the planning stage so some things could change. I consider this spend to fall under the Baller's discretionary fund so the result of the proposal would be reflected in the next distribution for the spending fund - whatever we spend here, I'll ask for less when we replenish the spending fund. We had 10 votes in favor of ""Whale"" sponsorship, all other responses got 0 in the forum poll. The ecosystem fund will send me the equivalent BAL after the snapshot vote finishes (assuming it passes).

124,QmQiatrqfsNZ4eSPCwBwaujBujwzhu2QqHEBSHqEoXs8g5,[Proposal] Replace Liquidity Mining Tiers on Polygon with Flexible BAL,"## Motivation
Our Polygon deployment has been successful, and the liquidity mining committee is excited to continue working to grow its TVL, highlight Balancer’s unique features and add new pools & partnerships.

To facilitate further growth, the Liquidity Mining Committee proposes that we replace the tier structure on Polygon, so we can incentivise more pools and have greater flexibility with how we organise dual incentive partnerships with other projects. We will also use some of the “Flexible BAL” proposed to encourage Polygon LBPs to maintain their liquidity on Balancer after launch, rather than migrating to Quickswap or Sushi.

If the results are positive, we may wish to look at repeating this in the future on Arbitrum, and Ethereum main net.

A core benefit of introducing complete flexibility like this is that the liquidity mining committee can easily take a small amount of BAL away from multiple pools when it wishes to incentivise a new pool, rather than having to deprecate or reduce the rewards significantly from a very small number of pools, which tends to result in TVL flight.

Our experiments have suggested that pools which have their BAL rewards reduced slightly tend to retain liquidity better, presumably due to LPs being content to accept a small APY reduction without moving, where a large sudden drop triggers them searching for other opportunities to provide their liquidity. We believe this new approach utilising fully flexible BAL allocations should therefore help us to accelerate TVL growth on Polygon.

Following discussions with the Polygon team, if we demonstrate that we can significantly increase Polygon TVL, we will also be able to secure another round of MATIC rewards for our pools, helping to grow TVL even further.

## Specification
If this proposal is approved, the liquidity mining tiers on Polygon would be replaced with a 25,000 BAL/week Flexible BAL allocation, that the liquidity mining can assign to pools as they see fit.

This flexible BAL allocation would be in addition to the 10,000 flexible BAL we’re already using across Ethereum & Arbitrum, rather than coming from that. So in effect, if this proposal passes, there’ll be a total of 35,000 flexible BAL per week across all networks we incentivise, with 25,000 of that carved out specifically for Polygon.

## Dependencies
None.

## Risk Assessment

125,QmTfws43mkzgV6KPeykx7riQwo16vJJ8pPcME1pc1Wqvym,Authorize Gauntlet to Manage MetaStable and Stable Pools,"
## Motivation

Currently Gauntlet manages dynamic fees for any two token pool which has delegated fee control to them on mainnet. With the advent of MetaStable and Stable pools and the increased complexity in managing not only the swap fee but the amplification parameter, Gauntlet wasn't able to accept management of these pool types immediately. They have signaled they are ready now, so we are proceeding with this vote quickly so these pools can start working better for our LP's and for the protocol. 

This proposal would only cover mainnet MetaStable and Stable Pools and only allow Gauntlet to manage the swap fee and amplification parameter. 

## Specification

The [Balancer governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would submit **FOUR** transactions to the [Authorizer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code) in order to grant the ability to set swap fees on StablePools and MetaStablePools to the [GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B#code) and the ability to set amplification factor on StablePools and MetaStablePools to the [GAUNTLET_SAFE](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf4A80929163C5179Ca042E1B292F5EFBBE3D89e6#code).

A few months ago, [this vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmUS4xSkxLCyHzJmHruLcq4rfdm8tyJoXu2dvPpNEkDn6i) was passed to allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to allocate BAL rewards for the AAVE/WETH v1 pool. The BPT from this pool is staked in the [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module) that secures the Aave Protocol. 

## Motivation

The pool currently [contains over $500M](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81) of liquidity. Fernando has been in touch with the Aave team and they have committed to migrating the pool to Balancer v2 later this year or January at latest. As a continued show of good faith in this important partnership, we should maintain the current rate of BAL rewards (12,500 BAL per week) until January 20th, 2022. Currently our commitment to this rate of rewards is set to expire on September 20th.

## Specification

As some may recall, governance approved sourcecred under [this vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmXQpKyw1BvYgZtvC2KGqrDezWBfSUBEKK77Kx866yBLYf) but the integration was never completed. Someone from sourcecred reached out to me recently and has gotten it nearly ready to use. The final piece of the puzzle is approving compensation for the team responsible for maintaining it.

## Motivation

You can read the previous vote for some context but this generally fits in with our goal of rewarding ground floor community contributors. It will be as simple as a Baller or Balancer Labs employee dropping a certain emoji on a community member’s discord message and that person will earn a small amount of BAL (one example).

From what I have been told, maintaining the sourcecred instance has social, administrative, IT, accounting, and transactional components. There will be a team of people responsible for handling all of this. **They are requesting 150-200 BAL per month.**

## Specification

It has been suggested internally that we apply a period of time to this rather than leaving it open ended. Thus, **I propose an 8 week trial period where the ecosystem fund will allocate 50 BAL per week to rewarding contributors (same as previous vote) and allocate 150 BAL per month to the sourcecred team for expenses.** At the conclusion of the trial period, governance will vote again to continue or not and at what rates. The 8 week period will begin once everything is in place which should be soon after this vote passes but can’t commit to a hard date at this time.

128,QmXBCp7H9aesjoutXCduHq9kDFtBkmRnZdgj2s9w7Yrc23,Increase BAL Reward Flexibility for LM Committee,"## Motivation
We’re now a few months into the V2 Liquidity Mining Program, and everyone’s been learning what’s good about it, as well as where improvements could be made to make the most of every BAL token we allocate. Since the launch, we’ve added a new Tier 4 (following a governance vote), and introduced liquidity mining rewards on Polygon. We’re quickly gaining traction on Polygon, and created a lot of excitement around Balancer, which has been awesome.

Over the coming weeks, there’s plans for launching on Arbitrum (although we need to be mindful of spreading liquidity mining rewards too thin + liquidity fragmentation), new pool deployments, and a number of dual incentive partnerships.

While all very positive and exciting, these plans create additional pressure on the limited number of liquidity mining slots we have, and it’s becoming difficult to envisage how everything will fit in without further changes to the tiers and slots. We also have some potential partnerships with smaller projects where weekly BAL rewards as low as 100-500 BAL per pool may make sense, which the committee doesn’t currently have the power to grant (the smallest we currently have available to us is a Tier 4 slot, at 1,000 BAL per week).

Dual incentive partnerships with smaller projects are very helpful for long term relationship building, securing liquidity for good projects which will grow over time & marketing to new users.

## Specification
If this proposal is approved, the Liquidity Mining Committee would be able to allocate a total of 10,000 BAL per week however it wants, outside of the tier system, to whichever networks & pools it decides make sense at the time, based on available opportunities.

This 10,000 BAL per week will be made available by removing 2xTier 2 slots, currently filled by USDC/WETH & USDT/WETH on Ethereum. There were already plans to deprecate these pools over time, as the Tier 1 WETH/DAI pool is planned to be replaced by a WETH/staBAL-3 pool when the batch relayer is ready.

This flexible BAL allocation will make it much easier for the committee to fine tune liquidity mining rewards, and phase pools in/out of rewards. For Polygon, Arbitrum, or any other network Balancer’s governance may decide to incentivise in the future, the committee will not be able to allocate more than the total BAL voted on by governance to that network across the new flexible BAL allocation and tiers. If flexible BAL is to be allocated to a network that would take it over its limit, a Tiered slot would need to be allocated back to Ethereum to keep it under.

As of the time of this proposal, a maximum of 25,000 BAL per week can be allocated to Polygon, and 25,000 BAL per week to Arbitrum. Governance may vote to change these limits in the future.

## Dependencies
None. The frontend liquidity mining script has already been updated to be more flexible, such that we could allocate any amount of BAL to any pool.

## Risk Assessment
We see no greater risk that Committee Members could “go rogue” and mis-manage rewards than they could with the current structure.

Governance would continue to have the power to halt the powers of the committee at any time, or remove members from the committee if it deemed such an action appropriate.

The Ballers are a group of passionate Balancer advocates whose primary goal is to build an engaged community around the protocol. That can take many forms and I encourage anyone who wants more context to give this update I recently published a quick read: [https://davis-ramsey.medium.com/the-ballers-summer-update-b3fd24cf55b9](https://davis-ramsey.medium.com/the-ballers-summer-update-b3fd24cf55b9)

## Motivation

Recently Fernando suggested we increase the “Ballery” from 100 BAL/month to 500 BAL/month with 60% long term vested (1y cliff, 1y linear vest period via Sablier) and 40% liquid. This was met with broad support on an informal basis. Ballers have the option to take a full or half Ballery and you can see the current breakdown of who’s taking what here: [https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d)

This is the most members the Ballers have ever had, and commensurately I expect the program to execute and deliver positive results in the community more effectively than we ever have. It is important to have oversight and to be accountable for the spend - the grants committee is 3/5 Ballers so we wanted to avoid the appearance of impropriety by going to them.

On that note, grants committee members also get paid 200 BAL per month liquid. Given I selected a full Ballery for myself and I also plan to serve on the grants committee, I will forfeit my grants payment back to the grants pool as a full Ballery alone is a significant amount.

## Specification

The liquid portion of the Ballery has been fully funded for the next 3 months, we only need to fund the vested portion of the payments this time. **Three months from now, I will make a proposal to fund both the liquid AND vested portions for the following three months.**

We need 5,400 BAL to fully fund vested Balleries for the next 3 months. I think it’s also important for the Ballers to have a spending fund we can use to reward community members who distinguish themselves on an ad-hoc basis and to run some community events like the POAP design competition. **Thus I will ask for an even 6,000 BAL with 5,400 going towards vested Ballers and 600 going to the Baller spending fund** (requires 2 ballers to agree, I custody funds secured by my ledger wallet).

I will coordinate setting up the vesting contracts with Fernando.","['Yes, fund it.', 'No, do not fund it.']","[326240.5846419051, 73329.6043541764]",1

Arbitrum’s launch is just around the [corner](https://offchain.medium.com/a-is-for-arbitrum-a-is-for-august-71391582d95b)! Balancer will soon be deployed on Arbitrum, bringing all the flexibility that V2 has to offer onto this highly anticipated Layer 2 solution.

This proposal requests approval for the Ballers Liquidity Mining Committee to have authority to allocate BAL for Liquidity Mining to Arbitrum. There are many similarities between this proposal and [the corresponding one for Polygon](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer/proposal/QmQeyTqNZC9VZSsxHKyCeehjhq4xc6MGTpjGycP4KqZ1BE).

## Motivation

The competition between scaling solutions is heating up, and the options for cheap, fast, secure transactions are growing fast. In addition to the technical requirements for deploying Balancer on a Layer 2, it’s hugely beneficial to have strong liquidity pools as soon as possible. Adding Liquidity Mining Incentives to pools on Arbitrum will help drive Liquidity Providers, and therefore traders, to utilize Balancer pools.

## Specification

Simply, this proposal requests approval for the Ballers Liquidity Mining Committee to have the authority to allocate **up to** 25,000 BAL per week for Arbitrum Liquidity Mining incentives.

There is still much discussion to be had about what the best strategy is for balancing incentives across Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Giving the Ballers Liquidity Mining Committee authority to (at most) match the authorized Polygon incentives gives them the flexibility they need to find the right balance.

The goal is to vote this weekend and be ready to deploy incentives on Arbitrum as close to their launch day as possible.","['Allocate BAL to Arbitrum pools', 'Do not allocate BAL to Arbitrum']","[270880.2685560969, 47969.132312899186]",1
131,Qme7GTPRKKHH8WRq4JKYHTecHbdjHiyqmPuSFMQjVYEBtj,[Proposal] Authorize LidoRelayer,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-authorize-lidorelayer/2136).

This proposal aims to authorize a relayer for atomically wrapping and unwrapping stETH and wstETH during typical Balancer V2 operations. The relayer would be granted authority to perform the following tasks on behalf of users **who have opted into using it**:
- Leverage the user's existing Vault allowances and internal balances to avoid duplicate approvals.
- Swap on the user's behalf.
- Add and remove liquidity on the user's behalf.

## Motivation

The upcoming wstETH-WETH meta stable pool is poised to be a huge source of liquidity for Balancer. Lido's [""staked ETH"" (stETH)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84) is a yield-bearing ERC-20 token that gives holders exposure to ETH staked in Eth2.0 validators. The design of this pool enables LPs who are long ETH to earn swap fees with minimal impermanent loss risk thanks to the high price correlation of the pool's assets. Curve Finance has a [similar pool](https://curve.fi/steth) with over $3B in liquidity at time of writing.

However, stETH is a rebasing token designed to maintain 1:1 correlation to underlying ETH, and rebasing tokens are incompatible with Balancer. Therefore, the Balancer pool actually contains not stETH but a wrapped version called wstETH which does not rebase. Because most of Lido's users hold stETH and not wstETH, this represents a UX challenge for Balancer traders, who would need to manually wrap or unwrap tokens before or after trading. The relayer seeking authorization in this proposal is designed to ease that UX burden by automatically wrapping or unwrapping stETH or wstETH within the same transaction as a swap, join, or exit.

## Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the LidoRelayer contract. Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message.

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions, and it has been thoroughly tested and peer-reviewed.

## Specification

The [Balancer governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would submit a transaction to the [Authorizer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code) in order to grant the following roles to the [LidoRelayer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcdbf71a870cc60c6f9b621e28a7d3ffd6dd4965#code):

1. `manageUserBalance`: Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to re-approve the new relayer for each token.
2. `joinPool`: Add liquidity to a pool on the user's behalf (for the user who holds stETH and wants to deposit to any wstETH pool).
3. `exitPool`: Remove liquidity from a pool on the user's behalf (for the user who wants to withdraw unwrapped stETH from any wstETH pool).
4. `swap`: Trade within a single pool on the user's behalf (for the user who either holds or demands stETH and wants to trade in any wstETH pool).
5. `batchSwap`: Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools (a more complicated swap, for the same user).

132,QmZbqjkfbxyfNyPpwYzHQ6ZiC81hYA9j83DoGjLXWFB9JZ,Authorize Gnosis Protocol V2 Contracts as a Vault Relayer on Balancer V2,"### Summary 

Following the announcement of the Balancer-Gnosis Protocol, this proposal aims to authorize the Gnosis Protocol V2 settlement contract with the necessary roles to:

- Leverage the Vault’s pre-existing user ERC20 allowances and balances.
- Swap on behalf of users with Balancer V2 pools, thereby providing Balancer with a protocol-level advantage on Gnosis Protocol v2.

### Motivation

Gnosis Protocol enables batched trading using off-chain signed orders. This trading protocol would enable Balancer V2 users to:

- **Trade with MEV protection** - leveraging the batch auction mechanism with uniform clearing prices as well as professional transaction submission with tight slippage, guarantees the traders to avoid suffering from MEV.
- **Balancer pools protocol advantage** - Gnosis Protocol V2 contracts have Balancer-specific optimizations, making it more efficient to use Balancer pools than other on-chain AMMs, which will therefore lead to more trades being settled on Balancer.
- **Gas-less trading experience** - The protocol is set so that the settlement is submitted by a third party which gets refunded its transaction cost from the traded ERC20 sell tokens (instead of ETH). As a nice side effect, if the protocol is not able to execute the trade order, the trader does not pay any fee.

Additionally, given that the vault supports modifying relayer permissions using off-chain signatures, it would be possible to offer users a completely “gas-less” experience, where a first-time user with existing Vault balances and/or allowances could trade on Gnosis Protocol V2 by only signing off-chain messages, with all required gas related being taken in the ERC20 tokens that are being traded.

This proposal would only add the required roles to the Gnosis Protocol V2 vault relayer contract. Users would still be required to opt-in by allowing Gnosis Protocol V2 to function as relayer on their behalf.

### Risks

The Gnosis Protocol settlement contract requires an order signed by the user in order to execute a transfer of funds or a swap. Additionally, neither the transfer nor the swap will be performed if the amount does not respect the user’s limit price included in the signed order.

Furthermore, while this proposal aims to authorize the Gnosis Protocol V2 contracts to act as a relayer, users must still opt-in to enable trading on Gnosis Protocol V2 by setting a relayer allowance (or signing an off-chain message granting this permission).

The code has been carefully tested, peer-reviewed and fully audited. The full smart contract audit can be found in the Gnosis Protocol V2 contracts public repository on Github[1] and there is an ongoing bug bounty[2].

### Specification

The Balancer governance multisig would submit a transaction to the the Authorizer contract in order to grant the following roles to the Gnosis Protocol V2 vault relayer contract:

manageUserBalance: this role would be used by GPv2 in order to transfer the “from” tokens for verified user orders to the settlement contract for batch trading.
batchSwap: Perform direct swaps on behalf of users, enabling user orders that were signed off-chain to get matched directly with Balancer pools.

Specifically, the Gnosis Safe at 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f[3] would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at 0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6[4] with the following data to authorize the Gnosis Protocol V2 Vault Relayer at 0xC92E8bdf79f0507f65a392b0ab4667716BFE0110[5]:

133,QmWxowvjqw2MmCWErTvKrMPYo4EnxAcikH6aaQwV1VrVdE,Establish Balancer Grants DAO,"### Summary

This proposal aims to **establish Balancer Grants DAO, an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem.** The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. **The requested budget for the first cycle (3 months) is 25,000 BAL, 80% of which will be allocated to grantees, as visualized in the breakdown below.** A learnings and review document will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.

The initial Balancer Grants team has already worked together for the past 4 weeks to create the basic grant framework and community channels - check it out here:[ https://balancer.community/](https://balancer.community/)

This is a synthesized version of the proposal. You can read the full text [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095). 

### Background

Grants and contributor rewards are important mechanisms for coordinating resources and developing ecosystems. Multiple large blockchain projects and DAOs have dedicated grant programs with varying success. Balancer hosted and ran its own grants through grants[ wave 1](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/why-the-balancer-community-received-over-1m-in-grants-434c9cab3908) and[ wave 2](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/batch-2-of-balancer-ecosystem-fund-grants-is-now-available-c6b1bf567483). The grants have attracted various resources and developers to the Balancer ecosystem but have recently slowed down.

The grants program has been hampered in its growth due to the over-reliance on the foundation team. This has meant there has been a lack of resources, tooling, and support for existing grantees. Additionally, the resource constraint has meant slow turnaround and suboptimal user experience for those who may join the ecosystem.

This is a part of the Balancer ecosystem that deserves more attention and with the right planning it can start to shine.

The grants committee has researched over 15 blockchain grants programs to get a clear overview of what an effective program looks like. We will combine multiple aspects of successful programs with original ideas from the grants committee and valuable feedback from the Balancer Labs team and community.

### PROPOSAL

We propose a rework of the current grants program by establishing the Balancer Grants DAO, a community-operated grants DAO dedicated to developing the Balancer Ecosystem.

The grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD 75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.

The Balancer Grants DAO will initially be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee can be found further in this proposal.

#### How the Grant review process will look

At Balancer, we want our applicants to feel heard and supported, not only financially. That is why we want this process to be as clear as possible. During the evaluation, the Grant Committee looks at the reasonable viability of the applications and does due diligence on the team. The evaluation process takes about 2 weeks.

If the application is successful, the team will be contacted, further steps will be discussed, and they will be connected with a mentor for regular calls to keep up to date and provide support. It is expected that this is reciprocated by grantees through operational transparency, high developer velocity, active repositories and frequent communications towards us.

### Grant Milestone Review

Balancer Grants will work with milestone based payouts. These milestones are clear and reasonable targets based on the communication between the grantees and the Grant Committee.

Grantees are encouraged to map their deliverables and timeline. We have provided a GANNT style template that grantees can use here:[ Project GANNT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17EMQk0fYKbNsNzb6R21tLDPaHzBkX0K8cRO4MGgx19U/edit?usp=sharing)

Rewards Grants are awarded in BAL tokens, based on predefined installments. Such installments are subject to a payment schedule to ensure that predefined milestones are achieved, and the first milestone can be prepaid. If a Grant application is larger than 75K USD, the project will have to be split into multiple Grant applications. The grants can be priced in either USD or BAL value, to be selected by the grantee at the start of the grant. If a grantee decides to price their reward in USD, 50% of the grant’s value will be converted from BAL to a stable asset to reduce market risk for the Balancer Grants DAO.

The Balancer Grants Committee controls payments and assesses milestone reports from grantees before follow-on payments. The Balancer Grants Committee may decide not distribute all follow-up payments for projects that do not hit their deliverables.

### Risks Analysis and Mitigation

- How does the Balancer Grant DAO ensure that grants contribute meaningfully?

To ensure that the Balancer Grants are allocated in line with the needs of the Balancer Ecosystem, an[ Ecosystem Assessment form](https://hi704760.typeform.com/to/lLmGUEEb) has been created by the Balancer Grants DAO and sent to 10 active contributors of the Balancer ecosystem operating in different areas to get a full picture of the current needs of the ecosystem. The results will be summarized by the Balancer Grants DAO and discussed during a to be organized open workshop.

- What happens if there are not sufficient quality grant applications?

All leftover grant funds get sent back to the BAL treasury in low participation or not enough quality applications.

- What if grants apply but do not deliver?

Although this is a common issue within all grant systems, we can mitigate this risk by providing mentoring and support. This will be one of the defining aspects of our approach—something that is often overlooked. Additionally, payments are always based on Milestones, limiting the potential resources lost when a grantee cannot deliver.

### Specification

If approved, the Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 4) will be funded with 25K BAL. The resources will be further divided across different multi-sigs controlled by the same group.

If approved, the [Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 4)](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597/balances) will be funded with 25K BAL. The resources will be further divided across different multi-sigs controlled by the same group.

All transactions will be recorded in a Sheet and summarized at the end of the Grants Cycle.

### Balancer Grants Composition

The Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds.

* Zeb Lelie: Senior Crypto-asset researcher - Grants Lead
* Luuk Weber - Baller
* Nick Tong - Baller
* Solarcurve - Baller
* **Open position: If you feel called to fill this spot, please let us know. Ideally, someone with a strong technical background.**

The Grants Committee will work closely with Balancer Labs, Ballers, Fire Eyes, and Kolektivo Labs to amplify and support grantees.

By having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi. A crucial area that has been largely overlooked.

### Budget breakdown

This budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period August 1st till October 31st.

At the end of this cycle (October 31st), any unspent resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle.

134,QmZk8p2iJwHd94pA61RBXYDk2StHLmQowHDKqLMorQP2k7,Onboard Fire Eyes DAO as Strategic Partner,"## Summary

This proposal outlines a collaboration between the Balancer Protocol and 🔥 _ 🔥 ([Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao)) to act as a governance steward and strategic partner to the Balancer ecosystem in return for 4,200 BPT tokens vested over 18 months, including a 6 month cliff. 

## Background

Since November 2020, Fire Eyes has been actively engaging with Balancer governance and working with Balancer Labs to steward the Balancer V2 launch. You can [read about the work here](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/x-balancer-4249df3f68c6?source=---------1-----------------------), but below are some highlights:

- [Assisted with the Balancer V2 Launch](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v2-generalizing-amms-16343c4563ff) 
- [Established the V2 liquidity mining program](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmeCrSe5xL5YWB17TjxAofYi3QnBMyHCYqufD8t3Zonj4S)
- [Implemented the govFactor in Balancer V1](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG)
- [Adding BAL to Aave](https://app.aave.com/governance/3-QmRT8PiQwzPUYZVvURqYBDpb8M6EveRUwkMY4uoTJXNmMm)

🔥_ 🔥 has always been focused on working alongside communities and projects that we believe are capable of achieving new heights of innovation in token and governance primitives. 

This is something we see in Balancer and why we're excited to present this proposal to the Balancer community outlining a continued scope of work.


## Key Areas 

🔥_ 🔥 [Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/hello-world-e3c9a409ea49) will engage with the Balancer community, the Ballers, and Balancer Labs in recurring meetings to develop new governance and token frameworks. This collaboration will be focused on: 

* **BAL Tokenomics**
    * Work with the community to finalize and implement a strategy for the BAL token to expand beyond governance, including potential ways for value capture and benefits for LPs.
*  **Acting as Balancer Protocol Politicians**
    * Develop new governance proposals and lead discussions on improving the Balancer protocol, and generating value for the ecosystem. 
    * Propose BAL and BPT token integrations into other DeFi protocols
* **Partnerships**
    * Help onboard new partners for Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, Balancer Smart Pools, and other protocol-unique applications like Aave Safety Modules. 
* **Balancer Market Position & Narrative**
    * Continue to develop the narrative of Balancer v2, asset managers, and protocol-unique applications.

These key areas will be worked on with 🔥_ 🔥 and the Balancer community through bi-weekly workshops, forum posts, Discord activity & governance proposals.

## Timeline

This proposal outlines a general timeline of **6 months** and a commitment from 🔥_ 🔥 to support Balancer as a protocol politician beyond the initial scope.

## Terms

🔥_ 🔥 is proposing to be compensated exclusively in BAL tokens vested in accordance with grants larger than 1,000 BAL. This allocation will come from the Ecosystem Fund.  Following community discussions, we've reduced the initial allocation and increased the vesting period to further align ourselves with community expectations. 

* **Grant Request: 4,200 BAL in BPT tokens, vested over 18 months with a 6 month cliff.**   

Fire Eyes will utilize this allocation to actively participate in Balancer governance and for liquidity on Balancer V2.

135,QmQeyTqNZC9VZSsxHKyCeehjhq4xc6MGTpjGycP4KqZ1BE,[Proposal] Empower Ballers to Allocate BAL to Polygon,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-empower-ballers-to-allocate-bal-to-polygon/1964).

Polygon (MATIC) has seen strong user adoption this year with major DeFi projects like Aave, Sushi, and Curve all deploying there. The time has come for Balancer to join the party. The polygon team has agreed to pledge $5M worth of MATIC as rewards over the course of 8 weeks to be allocated at our discretion. Balancer Labs has taken care of deployment logistics and with the approval of BAL voters we can jump start liquidity with BAL + MATIC incentives. This proposal would allow the Ballers to allocate BAL + MATIC incentives to chosen Balancer pools on polygon. To match polygon’s $5M worth of MATIC, I propose we begin with a 25,000 BAL per week allocation which can be adjusted in the future at the discretion of the Ballers but not reduced below 25,000 until the initial 8 week matching period has completed. These 25,000 BAL would come from the fixed 145,000 weekly issuance, reducing the total L1 incentive to 120,000 rather than increasing BAL inflation.

**Motivation**

Other polygon deployments have been wildly successful. Recently Sushi has done more volume on polygon than ETH mainnet (check [this thread](https://twitter.com/RaphaelSignal/status/1406234551618244611) and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1406181121562398723)). Balancer brings a unique primitive to polygon by being the only flexible AMM. Forthcoming features like the stable swap factory will give us additional competitive advantages on polygon compared to ETH mainnet where similar products exist in the market. Based on my analysis of Sushi’s metrics, I believe we can also expect to exceed fees earned on ETH mainnet after a few weeks go by on polygon.

The Ballers plan to focus on multi-asset pools with higher fees and potentially building partnerships with polygon native projects. Any community input about pool composition or projects worth connecting with is greatly appreciated (#governance in discord).

25,000 is a sizable commitment but the potential opportunity is significant. I strongly believe we can generate more fees per BAL spent on polygon than we can with our current strategy on ETH mainnet.

**Specification**

If approved, the Ballers will immediately begin designing pools and assigning the BAL + MATIC rewards. As mentioned, the MATIC rewards would last for 8 weeks ($5M total over 8 weeks) and a minimum of 25,000 BAL per week would last for 8 weeks. After that, the Ballers can decide to adjust that number up or down (with community input!).

136,QmUS4xSkxLCyHzJmHruLcq4rfdm8tyJoXu2dvPpNEkDn6i,[Proposal] Allocate BAL to AAVE/WETH Stakers,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allocate-bal-to-aave-weth-stakers/1909).

As part of [Aave’s Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module), an 80/20 AAVE/WETH pool was created which has since grown to be the largest pool on Balancer v1. The creation of this pool, along with the dual incentives of BAL + AAVE, established a strong partnership between Balancer and Aave. That partnership has continued with the ongoing development of the Aave Asset Manager (AM), which will be the first AM deployed on Balancer v2.

**Motivation**

Given the critical importance of the Safety Module, Aave requires additional time to migrate their pool to Balancer v2. In order to preserve the allocation of 12,500 BAL per week the pool was receiving before v2 Liquidity Mining started, we need to give Ballers the authority to allocate BAL to the 80/20 AAVE/WETH pool on v1.

**Specification**

The Ballers will initially allocate two Tier 2 slots and one Tier 3 slot for a combined 12,500 BAL per week - this will be reflected in the next weekly vote on the Baller-only snapshot. Going forward, the Ballers will have sole discretion to adjust this pool’s allocation as they see fit. The BAL allocated to this pool by the Ballers will go directly to users who have staked BPT from this pool in the Safety Module, meaning if you enter this pool and do not stake in the Safety Module you will not get BAL rewards.This pool will no longer be included in the v1 reward calculations.

Note: Aave has agreed to a three month migration deadline. BAL rewards will be provided during this time period, though not necessarily at the full 12,500 BAL per week. Ballers can choose to lower the amount if they deem it appropriate. At the end of three months, if they have not migrated to v2 then BAL rewards for their pool will end. The migration deadline will be September 20th, 2021.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[387280.456599579, 14540.202967983963]",1

The early pools are growing well, but as debates have been taking place among the Ballers Committee plus wider governance, a recurring challenge has been that there are pools we’d like to experiment with incentivising, where the Tier 3 BAL allocation (2,500 BAL per week) is too great of an allocation or risk.

This is slowing some of the progress in migrating LM rewards from V1 to V2. This proposal was [initially published to the forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-introduce-a-new-tier-4-to-the-liquidity-mining-program/1928/13), and following discussion the below final proposal was agreed.

        Tier 1 (T1): 15,000 BAL (4 slots, total of 60k BAL per week) - Pools where strong liquidity is paramount, e.g. for acting as hubs by connecting liquidity in order routing.
        Tier 2 (T2) : 5,000 BAL (10 slots, total of 50k BAL per week) - Strategic pools, e.g. having strong potential for high volume given high liquidity.
        Tier 3 (T3) : 2,500 BAL (14 slots, total of 35k BAL per week) - Promising pools, e.g. containing newly launched tokens or small cap projects (unproven potential for high volume).

This proposal passing would replace the above 3 Tier program with the following 4 Tier program:

        Tier 1 (T1): 15,000 BAL (4 slots, total of 60k BAL per week) - Pools where strong liquidity is paramount, e.g. for acting as hubs by connecting liquidity in order routing.
        Tier 2 (T2) : 5,000 BAL (9 slots, total of 45k BAL per week) - Strategic pools, e.g. having strong potential for high volume given high liquidity.
        Tier 3 (T3) : 2,500 BAL (12 slots, total of 30k BAL per week) - Promising pools, e.g. mid caps, and experimental pools that have proven significant traction in Tier 4.
        Tier 4 (T4) : 1,000 BAL (10 slots, total of 10k BAL per week) - Experimental pools, e.g. many-token pools, newly launched/small cap projects, early stage partnerships.

In practice this means that 1x Tier 2 slots and 2x Tier 3 slots will be used to create a new Tier 4 with 10 slots. 

The committee will then typically add new pools into Tier 4, measure success and then bump those which are successful up, and similarly move pools down from Tier 3 should it make strategic sense.

BENEFITS
====================

There are a number of significant benefits members of the committee can envisage from this additional tier:

1. The committee can run more liquidity mining experiments with lower risk. As it stands, the minimum we can allocate is equivalent to ~$75,000 USD per week, which is a large amount for a small project or pool structure which may not for some reason attract sufficient liquidity & trade volume.
2. More pools can be incentivised overall. This should help us to migrate more pools from L1, and mean we upset fewer L1 LPs who suddenly lose all their rewards.
3. The committee can more easily setup LM partnerships with other smaller cap projects, where dual LM incentives are offered.
4. Tier 3 pools which for some reason no longer warrant the 2,500 BAL/week can be downgraded, rather than completely excluded.

All other aspects of the Liquidity Mining program would remain unchanged. Should the vote pass, the new Tier 4 slots will be available for the Liquidity Mining week starting June 21st 2021, at 00:00 UTC.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[1179666.754926019, 0]",1

Three weeks ago, Balancer governors [voted to allow Gauntlet](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmZZycpDWZYAzNho6uVaWL5nFpVzauc89HC9d5QNTSn18J) to set swap fees on pools deployed from the [WeightedPoolFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8E9aa87E45e92bad84D5F8DD1bff34Fb92637dE9#code). At the time, this was the only Balancer V2 pool factory available; but since then, another specialization has been deployed for [two-token pools which provide TWAP oracles](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA5bf2ddF098bb0Ef6d120C98217dD6B141c74EE0#code). This proposal seeks to grant the same authorization to Gauntlet, but for the new pool factory.

## Motivation

Please consult the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-authorize-gauntlet-network-to-set-swap-fees/1799) for the full details. In short, this authorization would apply **only to pools using the delegated owner** address (`0xBA1BA1ba1BA1bA1bA1Ba1BA1ba1BA1bA1ba1ba1B`). For those pools which have opted in, Gauntlet's power would extend **only to the swap fee**; Gauntlet cannot alter any other attributes of the pool nor extract funds.

## Specification

The Balancer Governance Multisig would submit one transaction as follows. Here, ""Multisig"" refers to the Gnosis Safe at `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` and ""Authorizer"" is the smart contract at [`0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code).

1. Grant [Gauntlet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B#code) the ability to set swap fees on pools deployed from the WeightedPool2TokensFactory

139,QmZX2vBrhJF6hEAt4WqnuXAsmGpsugWRungL7xAhfQTFPZ,[Proposal] Add liquidity to BAL call options on UMA,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/add-liquidity-to-bal-call-options-on-uma/1851).

This is a follow-on proposal to this temperature check post [here](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-launch-bal-call-options-using-uma-protocol/1689).

I would like to proposal that Balancer add liqudiity to the BAL call options built on UMA. These calls are decentralized and permissionless, and secured by UMA's optimistic oracle. 

You can see the frontend they are already traded on at mysynths.finance 

There was over $10M in trading volume across the life of the token that expired April 31st ""out of the money.""

**The Proposal**
UMA has already used 7000 from our treasury to mint call options, plus about 500 more to LP. That gives us about $70k in liquidity in the pool. 

We would like to ask Balancer to match that 7500 by minting 7000 call options and pairing that with additional BAL tokens into the [Balancer pool here](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xd5675d073c17a9d22ebe0ebfe35b95ebe6e28a84/). 

At the current price of .0762 BAL per call, that would be 7000 minted calls + 0.0762*7000 = 533 BAL, for a total of 7533 BAL.

This would double the liquidity in the pool and give the Balancer community a chance to experiment with this product and gather data and build some experience. **The goal is to keep rolling this liquidity into next launches, as the market and BAL community has time to learn about this product and how it works.**

**Implementation & a note on IL**
The calls can be minted using a Gnosis safe in connection with wallet connect using the mysynth.finance UI. Then, they would simply need to be added to the pool to achieve this outcome.

The UMA team will commit to communicating with the Balancer team and advise them when to pull the liquidity - It is not advisable to let the liquidity remain in the pool too close to the expiry date as the options can expire valueless, and thus the IL would be punishing. 

**Other Information**
These are the current call options supported by other projects look like this:

BAL presently: $70K with 7500 BAL locked ($400k value locked)
UMA - $4.5M in liquidity with 900k $UMA locked ($22M valued locked)
UNI - $190k in liquidity with 32.5k UNI ($1.35M valued locked)
SUSHI - 77.8k SUSHI (1.16M valued locked)

Please kindly reply with any questions about any details I might have left out. Thanks for your time and I look forward to working together and cross-promoting!","['Approve', 'Reject']","[902467.8192624088, 20451.87931280742]",1
140,QmSGcp1sPMZVabS6xknxLzX4UniS3CCnDcekK7EMeQvPMi,[Proposal] BAL for Gas on Balancer V2,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas-on-balancer-v2/1861).

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose we include V2 trades in the BAL for Gas program.

## Proposal

The mechanics to determine eligible transactions and BAL amounts would be [the same as in V1](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437), except:
1. In addition to the Exchange Proxy, transactions sent to [the Vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8) would qualify for the program (the Exchange Proxy only connects trades to V1 pools)
2. The gas amount to be reimbursed for trades through the V2 Vault would be defined as:
    * 90,000 gas for transactions containing one swap
    * 140,000 gas for transactions containing two or more swaps.

As V2 goes live and we start collecting more data, we would possibly review those amounts and create specific tiers for transactions containing three or four swaps.

## Motivation

The BAL for Gas program has become an important mechanism for distributing Balancer protocol governance power to one of its widest user bases: traders. With the launch of Balancer V2, it is only fair that users who have their trades routed through V2 pools get the same treatment as those who go through V1.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[734046.3942812367, 203274.43051686848]",1
141,QmZZycpDWZYAzNho6uVaWL5nFpVzauc89HC9d5QNTSn18J,[Proposal] Balancer V2: Authorize Gauntlet Network to set swap fees,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-authorize-gauntlet-network-to-set-swap-fees/1799).

The Balancer V2 core smart contracts were deployed to mainnet earlier this week, and the full UI launch is right around the corner. In the final days leading up to the launch, the core dev team at Balancer Labs intends for the Balancer Governance Multisig to execute additional authorizations on chain. But Balancer Labs has no decision-making power over the Multisig, which is strictly governed by BAL holders. 

The authorization to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet Network to set swap fees on certain pools which have opted into the feature.

## Motivation

One of the exciting features planned for Balancer V2 is **dynamically optimized swap fees** powered by **Gauntlet Network**. These dynamic fees help to boost returns for liquidity providers by adapting to changing market conditions, while also reducing the pool design space by consolidating multiple potential pools into a single fee strategy.

But this feature is only made possible by granting Gauntlet's smart contract ([`0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B#code)) **authorization to change the swap fee** on certain pools. This authorization applies only to pools using the delegated owner address (`0xBA1BA1ba1BA1bA1bA1Ba1BA1ba1BA1bA1ba1ba1B`); **pool creators retain the ability to opt out** of Gauntlet-powered fees by setting the owner to their own EOA, a smart contract, or the zero address for immutability. Even for pools which have opted in, Gauntlet's power would extend to the swap fee and **only the swap fee**; Gauntlet cannot alter any other attributes of the pool.

## Specification

The Balancer Governance Multisig would submit 1 transaction as follows. Here, ""Multisig"" refers to the Gnosis Safe at `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` and ""Authorizer"" is the smart contract deployed this week at [`0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code).

142,Qma3oK8Ltq6YqLvh4xBc359LvYpkQ3b6kxhTCVMnDkHb1M,[Proposal] Balancer V2: Authorize Balancer Labs to emergency pause,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/1798).

The Balancer V2 core smart contracts were deployed to mainnet earlier this week, and the full UI launch is right around the corner. In the final days leading up to the launch, the core dev team at Balancer Labs intends for the Balancer Governance Multisig to execute additional authorizations on chain. But Balancer Labs has no decision-making power over the Multisig, which is strictly governed by BAL holders. 

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a Balancer Labs EOA to control the system's emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Vault and WeightedPool smart contracts have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from deployment time. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users**, even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a single EOA ([`0x170027069fd114BFF2f57B0FC796df93290C02a6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x170027069fd114BFF2f57B0FC796df93290C02a6)) to pause the system**. The EOA will be controlled by a handful of stakeholders at Balancer Labs across different time zones to ensure short response time. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Multisig nor the EOA will have any pause power; Balancer V2 becomes unstoppable.

## Specification

The Balancer Governance Multisig would submit 2 transactions as follows. Here, ""Multisig"" refers to the Gnosis Safe at `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` and ""Authorizer"" is the smart contract deployed this week at [`0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code).

143,QmeCrSe5xL5YWB17TjxAofYi3QnBMyHCYqufD8t3Zonj4S,Proposal] Balancer V2 Liquidity Mining Program,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-liquidity-mining-program/1678/42).

## Motivation

Crypto moves fast and the AMM space is as competitive as ever. In order to stay relevant and to attract significant liquidity, Balancer needs to implement a flexible Liquidity Mining Program which targets high priority pools and can respond quickly to changing market conditions. 

Unfortunately, this can result in significant overhead for normal BAL governance. Constantly weighing in, voting, and checking the forums on a daily basis can be a hassle for most BAL holders. 

As a result, this proposes having a dedicated committee of core members to the Balancer protocol to lead this charge and ensure that the protocol is always incentivizing the right pools, at the right time.

## Specification

Balancer V2 Liquidity mining incentives will operate in **three** tiers governed by a combination of BAL governance and the Ballers Committee. 

![Screen Shot 2021-04-13 at 9.14.21 PM|690x74](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/98f34188a9d69eb4eac9cd5149b3f831a85a27a7.png) 

Tier 1 will be voted on by BAL governance while Tier 2 and Tier 3 are voted on by the Ballers committee. 

**All Balancer community members will retain the right to make proposals and signal support for T2 & T3 Liquidity Mining inclusion.** The Ballers Committe will act as a liason between community sentiment and formal changes to the program. Discussions on Liquidity Mining inclusion will be open for all community members on both Discord and the Forum. 

**The Ballers Committee will have no control over the Tier 1 slots**. Instead, they will be governed by normal BAL governance which will be put up for vote every 12 weeks. Additionally, all decisons made by the Ballers Committee (*along with voting addresses*) will be made public for everyone to see prior to implementation.

In order to accomodate for sufficient yield to attract liquidity on certain pools, more than one slot may be allocated to a single pool by consuming additional T2 and T3 slots as voted on by the committee. 

The timing for changes on each tier outlined above is a guideline--BAL governance and the Ballers Committee will always have the right to change tiers if the market conditions deem it necessary (*examples include rug pulls, bugs, and other issues which would require quick response by governance)*.  

### BAL/ETH Pool

In order to mitigate the reduction in yields for the BAL/ETH pair, **the Ballers committee will aim to target the existing returns in V1 (60-70% APY) through the use of additional T2 & T3 slots.**

It's important to highlight that there are a significant amount of variables that will affect the BAL/ETH APY (as well as all other pools). This includes amount of liquidity migrated during the transition, amount staked, tiers consumed, etc. 

With all those variables, The Ballers Committee will be responsible for trying to ensure that the APY on the BAL/ETH pool are in line with the above. 

### Transition from V1 to V2 Mining
The transition from Balancer V1 liquidity mining to V2 will be gradual and take several weeks. This will start with only a few of the Tier 3 (T3) and Tier 2 (T2) slots being filled by top priority pools, with new slots being ""activated’’ on a rolling basis, targeting every week. 

At every activation, the corresponding amount of BAL is subtracted from the weekly amount available in the V1 liquidity mining program. This way the total BAL distributed through liquidity mining between both V1 and V2 pools will always stay the same at 145,000 BAL per week.

As the community becomes more confident that there are no vulnerabilities in the V2 smart contracts, more of the liquidity mining program is expected to shift from V1 to V2 until the entirety of the V1 allocation is exhausted. This can happen by having more of the available slots being assigned to V2 pools, and also by upgrading a V2 pool to a higher tier.

The transition period will aim to take roughly 8 weeks from the start of V2 mining. **At the end of the transition period, Tier 1 slots will be allocated to these pools:**

* 80/20 BAL/ETH, dynamic fee
* 60/40 ETH/DAI, dynamic fee
* 50/50 ETH/WBTC, dynamic fee
* DAI/USDC/USDT stable pool

### Ballers Committe

The selection of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Liquidity Mining Pools will discussed on a weekly basis according to community input and signal, and voted on formally by the Ballers Commmitee. 

**The Ballers Committe is open to everyone. Any engaged individuals in the community can be elected by fellow community members to join the committee.** More on this below. 

**The goal of using the Ballers Committee is to avoid extensive overhead on BAL governance as well as to provide quick responses according to market conditions.** 

Ballers will use a specific Snapshot space (*separate space from traditional BAL governance*) so that the community can easily keep track of those decisions.

All decisions made by Ballers will be made public on Balancer’s forum shortly after the end of the committee weekly meetings (ideally within 2-3 hours). Highly respected individuals and working groups in the space may also be invited by Ballers to these meetings to provide strategic input. **That said, they will have no formal voting rights on Snapshot.**

### Additional Background on Ballers 

*Ballers are active members of the community that have gone above and beyond by contributing significant resources and time to the Balancer Protocol.* There are currently 10 Ballers in the community as assigned by [their tag on Discord](https://discord.gg/ARJWaeF). 

Ballers are currently elected by the team at Balancer Labs, however, there intends to be a formal governance process by BAL holders surrounding the election of future Ballers and the encompassing committee. 

With that, The Ballers group is expected to expand and rotate over time, encouraging regular community members to keep a high level of engagement so they can eventually become Ballers too!

BAL governance has the ultimate power to elect and dismiss Ballers through Snapshot votes. Ballers and the broader community will constantly assess how participative Ballers are and how good their decisions on the allocation of liquidity mining slots are.

## Drawbacks

- **The Ballers Committee is a small group of individuals and can poses centralization risks, collusion, etc.** It's important to note that BAL governance always retains the right to remove Ballers from their position. In addition, becoming a Baller is a selective process and requires a significant amount dedication to the protocol--meaning they're extremely aligned with the success of Balancer! 
- **This structure would eliminate liquidity incentives for the long-tail of pools.** This is true, however, the upgrade to Balancer V2 drastically increases gas efficiency and creates a natural incentive for project teams to drive liquidity to Balancer given its competitive conditions for trading, namely lower gas costs. Importantly, some competitors don't offer liquidity incentives *at all* and still have sufficient liquidity for the long-tail of assets. We believe that V2's upgrade is substantial enough to compete with this market dynamic. 

## Summary

Balancer V2 liquidity mining will operate in 3 tiers. Tier 1 will be voted on by governance on a recurring basis while Tier 2 and Tier 3 pools will be strategically assigned by the Ballers Committee based on community sentiment. 

It's important to highlight that certain pools may be allocated more than one slot by the committee. For instance, the BAL/ETH pool may be elected multiple slots in order for the APY to tentatively match the BAL/ETH APY on V1 as mentioned.

All community members will always have the ability to signal their support for liquidity mining inclusion for T2 and T3 pools in order to guide the committee. 

The transition from V1 to V2 will take place over a targeted ~8 weeks with BAL liquidity mining allocations incrementally migrated to V2 on a weekly basis. Throughout the entirety of the migration, the weekly BAL distribution will remain constant at 145,000 BAL per week spread across both Balancer V1 and V2.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[480594.4705437769, 99201.60151946594]",1
144,Qme1RPxSb6AfxrGPAKW6VgSvJ8EBMNTgYqRgp6NNrKGojC,[Proposal] Extend govFactor in Balancer V1,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-extend-govfactor-in-balancer-v1/1755).

### Summary

Vote on whether or not the Balancer protocol should extend the [govFactor](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG) and keep it in perpetuity for Balancer V1 liquidity mining.  

### Motivation

The govFactor was initially implemented as a trial to test voting incentives for the Balancer Protocol. The trial was successful as voter participation increased substantially across the board for all Snapshot Proposals. 

For reference, the three most recent proposals prior to the govFactor vote averaged 91,000 BAL (~0.53% of circulating supply) compared to the three most recent proposals today which averaged 1.2M BAL (~7.0% of the circulating supply) in tokenholder participation.

With the upcoming transition to Balancer V2, **there are no factors.** Therefore, the govFactor will not be implemented in V2 liquidity mining. 

This proposal aims to identify whether or not the Balancer protocol should keep the govFactor in perpetuity for V1 liquidity mining. 

## Specification 

The govFactor is a 1.1x factor applied to the adjusted liquidity--the liquidity measured in USD terms after all other factors have been applied--of V1 LPs who voted on the most recent Snapshot proposal(s). 

For more information on the govFactor and how it works, please read the [original Snapshot proposal here](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG).

The BAL for Gas budget is nearly exhausted and needs to be replenished in order for the program to continue beyond this week.

# The Proposal
Add **50,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the BAL for Gas budget. For reference on the mechanics of the ongoing campaign, please consult the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437) which was approved by governance five weeks ago. In summary, the campaign's budget is used to distribute BAL tokens to traders on the [Balancer Exchange](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) as a subsidy for Ethereum network gas costs. It is consumed on a first-come, first-served basis, and will most likely be depleted within the next few days unless this proposal is approved to replenish.

# Motivation
The Ethereum network has been quite congested for the last several months as the DeFi ecosystem continues to flourish. As an unfortunate result of this increased demand, transaction costs are often prohibitive for the average user. The Balancer community strives to cultivate a protocol that is welcoming to all - not only to whales - and so it has been utilizing its sizeable treasury to help reduce the overall costs of protocol usage.

The BAL for Gas campaign also serves as a mechanism for distributing Balancer protocol governance power to one of its widest user bases: traders. The [liquidity mining program](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/proposing-balancer-liquidity-mining-cab4503972fa) has been distributing BAL tokens to liquidity providers for almost a year (45 weeks!), but only with the recent launch of BAL for Gas did traders become eligible as well. In the time since the initial pilot, 43,019 BAL tokens have been distributed to 20,749 unique addresses. Of those recipients, 18,970 (91%) did not hold any BAL prior to the start of the program!

Though the campaign has already been live for several weeks, recent [traction on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1379501996353392645) and new advertisements in podcasts/newsletters suggest that visibility is only just beginning. These distribution numbers should continue to grow in the weeks ahead and provide a deeper window into the lasting effects (or lack thereof) of the program.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[725352.1458356896, 183553.88085234447]",1

### Context

Since its inception, the long term vision for the Balancer Protocol is to be fully governed by BAL token holders, while token ownership is aimed to be widely spread across the Balancer community.

But getting to that ideal, long-term vision of an actually decentralized and effective governance is no easy task. Protocol governance is a highly complex and rapidly evolving topic. The whole crypto ecosystem is still in the very early days of trying to figure out:

* which mechanisms and processes work best
* the necessary infrastructure, tooling and user interfaces that go with them
* the risks and concerns associated with each approach

Experimentation has been running wild in all directions:

* vote delegation,
* minimum quorum,
* specialized committees,
* continuous voting,
* augmented voting power via token lock,
* off-chain voting for signaling / polling,
* on-chain actions from off-chain voting by way of oracles,
* upgradeable smart contracts,
* time delays on sensitive actions,
* emergency actions via multisig (e.g. pause, shutdown),
* legal entities (e.g. foundation) providing support for the DAO,
* tools for DAO treasury management,
* token issuance to cover protocol expenses,
* incentivized voting,
* incentivized off-chain engagement (e.g. forum participation),
* and so on...

While also actively experimenting with governance-related initiatives, the Balancer community has leaned towards the more cautious and thoughtful approach of not trying to rush the path to full decentralization, so each step towards a mature on-chain governance will be taken with due care, having learned from others' experiences.

Balancer V1 contracts are immutable, so up to now there were no core protocol parameters to tweak/change. Instead, our governance has focused on a fair, inclusive BAL token distribution, which is carried out mainly through the protocol's liquidity mining. BAL holders have tweaked liquidity mining via off-chain voting. And to make that possible, BalancerLabs proudly developed in-house an open-source tool called [Snapshot](https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs), which became the widely popular gold standard for off-chain voting in blockchain land. Snapshot was so successful that it's being spun off as its own initiative so that it can keep up with the improvements required by all its users.

Balancer V2 contracts, on the other hand, are not totally immutable and do allow for some tweaking of the core protocol operation, for instance, in turning on protocol fees. As a placeholder for a future onchain DAO, such limited admin powers will be initially granted to a multisig.

### The Multisig

First of all, a very important point: the multisig does NOT have decision making power, as its role is to simply enact on-chain the decisions BAL holders make via off-chain voting.

It will be deployed using [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 6-of-11. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by BAL holders with protocol security in mind.

Balancer's multisig signers are a diverse set of widely respected community members. These are the initial signers:

* [Alexander Lange](https://twitter.com/AlexLangeVC) (Inflection)
* [Ash Egan](https://twitter.com/AshAEgan) (Accomplice)
* [Davis Ramsey](https://twitter.com/DavisRamsey) (pools.vision)
* [Fabien Marino](https://twitter.com/bonustrack87) (Snapshot Labs)
* [Jake Brukhman](https://twitter.com/jbrukh) (CoinFund)
* [Kain Warwick](https://twitter.com/kaiynne) (Synthetix)
* [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) (Gitcoin)
* [Mariano Conti](https://twitter.com/nanexcool) (Ethereum)
* [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState) (Bankless)
* [Trent McConaghy](https://twitter.com/trentmc0) (Ocean Protocol)
* [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) (Fire-eyes)

Beyond those current signers, the community should strive to keep a short, ordered list of potential signers in order to make any eventual signer substitution as smooth and timely as possible.

During its lifecycle, the operation of the multisig is expected to gradually evolve towards requiring less and less trust, for instance by using [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f) (which binds the results from Snapshot off-chain BAL voting to on-chain execution with the help of [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracles). Balancer has been an early supporter of SafeSnap.

In the long run, BAL holders are expected to retire the multisig in favor of a full-fledged Balancer DAO.

### Signer Duties

All signers are expected to create an Ethereum transaction ratifying each decision made by BAL holders through snapshot votes. This signature is expected to be done within the two weeks after the snapshot vote was concluded. Even after quorum is reached (by n signers), the remaining signers are also expected to sign before a multisig action is executed. This procedure aims to regularly confirm each signers' conformity to the off-chain votes and also to serve as recent proof of their ability to sign.

A signer shall lose his/her role (by action of the remaining multisig signers excluding him/her) in case he/she:

* acts against BAL token holders' off-chain voting;
* goes through 3 months or 2 votes (whichever takes longer) without performing any of their signer duties.

### Multisig Powers in V2

V2 smart contracts can grant some specific powers to an ""admin"" address, which will initially point to the multisig's address.

These powers are:

* set a share of swap fees to be diverted to the protocol (hard capped at 50% of the swap fee);
* set a flashloan fee;
* set a withdrawal fee to be charged by the protocol when an LP extracts tokens from the vault outside of a swap or when internal balances are withdrawn from the vault (the maximum withdrawal fee possible is 0.5% or 50 bps);
* extract from the vault collected protocol fees and/or excess balances (e.g. airdrops), to any destination;
* set the address of the oracle implementation;
* pause/resume swaps on all pools before a 4-month-after-launch deadline, after which Balancer V2 becomes unstoppable;
* set relayer addresses: relayers are (user opt-in, audited) contracts that can make calls to the vault (with the transaction ""sender"" being any arbitrary address) and use the sender's ERC20 vault allowance, internal balance or BPTs on their behalf;
* set dynamic-fee controllers: addresses (initially assigned to Gauntlet) that may change the swap fee for pools created by the dynamic-fee pool factory that will be deployed by Balancer Labs.

It's worth highlighting that the multisig will not have custody of (nor control over) funds from liquidity providers that lie inside Balancer Protocol contracts. Balancer V2 was designed so that even if the multisig goes rogue, all the liquidity is safe and can be withdrawn by their rightful owners.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[1260016.7469344116, 5802.199465674627]",1
147,QmUfV627SNpKTNqFc5bEdCXTLnHDF6KvgtbLcdmFmdqP3f,[Proposal] BAL for Gas,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign. We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isn’t clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade. During these times of network congestion and high gas costs, we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer. With that in mind, it doesn’t seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until “next Wednesday” to find out what they’ve earned from trading. We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency; what you see is what you get, or at least as close as possible. We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission.

# The Proposal
Allocate **30,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the “BAL for Gas'' campaign. There is no fixed time period; the budget is consumed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. When the budget is exhausted, the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance.

For **each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy**, award claimable BAL tokens to the trader. An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is a **swap between any two tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json)**. Claims are made available at the [BAL claims interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/) on Wednesday (UTC time) following the close of the weekly period (00:00 UTC Monday - 23:59 UTC Sunday) in which the trade occurred.

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction:

![table|690x185](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/dd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2.png)

For converting gas to BAL, use the **median gas price of the enclosing block** and the **BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko** closest to the block time.

# Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar, but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program. All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience, which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency.

First, this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user. Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant. Instead, deterministic figures are favored: the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps, and the gas price is the block median, rather than the user’s own price. It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time, whereas it is much easier to predict block-wide parameters. Predictability informs transparency.

The second major shift pertains to the budget. The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget, which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending. Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended, and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any trade-time estimates useless. In contrast, here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade. If there are still funds remaining in the budget, the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded; and if the budget is exhausted, then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero. When the well runs dry, BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign.

Third, the BAL/ETH price model is modified. Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period, the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time. Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded.

![image|690x120](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/e00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810.png)

Finally, the fixed amounts of gas (130k, 220k, 300k, 400k) were chosen so that only 1% of all trades, on average, would be overcompensated. This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit, but nonetheless **we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity**. The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade, which is why only four numbers are provided; any transactions containing 5+ swaps must belong to bots, whereas the target audience is end users. We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400,000 gas; any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit.

# Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible, there is still a very small amount of room for error. Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time (estimated) and at dispersal time (actual).

At the time of the trade:

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **estimated** gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider. This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block, which cannot be known in advance.
4. The **estimated** BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the large [80/20 BAL/WETH pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4/). This acts as a real-time oracle which isn’t worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount.
5. The user will see, in one summary number, the final result of #1-4: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget. A USD estimate is also provided for completeness, with the BAL/USD price being queried from CoinGecko’s API.

The UI changes are still being finalized, but as a mockup consider the image below.

![image2|485x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8.png)

At dispersal time (computed by the [open source mining scripts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts)):

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **actual** gas price is the median from the block containing the trade. We will filter out artificially low-price transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median - these are typically 0-gwei or 1-gwei transactions.
4. The **actual** BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price. All in all, the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign.

# The Proposal
The [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) will come to a close at 00:00 UTC on February 22. This proposal seeks to extend the program another four weeks, to end at 00:00 UTC on March 22. We would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy. It should be noted that three days still remain in the pilot, but at present about 20,000 BAL would still remain from that initial budget, and those tokens should be used toward the 30,000 BAL budget for this extension. The remainder will be taken from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund.

# Motivation
The initial pilot has gone well. During its first 3.5 weeks, a total of 9332 BAL have been issued to 4568 recipients. Of these recipients, only 846 had held BAL before the start of the program, which indicates that distributing governance tokens to traders does indeed improve decentralization of voting power. This decentralization has always been one of the core goals of our liquidity mining program, but that program applies only to liquidity providers and not traders.

There has been some discussion on Discord about extending the program indefinitely, but first we need an opportunity to make refinements and collect more data to gauge the program's effect on core protocol metrics. Over the course of this four-week extension, we should be prepared to make structural modifications to the program (ratified by governance) to improve the user experience, which seems to be holding back many traders from participating. We should also, as a community, make a concerted effort to increase awareness of the program in order to grow the sample size of the data.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details. Also refer to the program's [expansion to all whitelisted tokens](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799), which would remain in effect throughout this extended period.

Swaps between any two of the tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total. However, there is room for flexibility here: the amount issued through Week N should never exceed N*7500; but if previously unused tokens remain they can be utilized. For example, if only 1,000 BAL are spent in Week 1 but Week 2 requires 10,000 BAL, then 2,500 BAL will be taken from the Week 1 budget and put toward Week 2 so as not to unnecessarily restrict the distribution for that week.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program and the gas reimbursement pilot. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[943853.4048451968, 5545.496299878061]",1

**The Proposal**

This proposal is to increase TEL cap tier from cap1 to cap2. TEL’s current liquidity surpassed >$3M with a total liquidity of $6.1M pooled. Tel pool can be found [here](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x6cb5c5cb789fae62ce5ce280e1fbc5dd3bbdad81/).

**What is Telcoin?**

Telcoin is a full stack financial platform built on ethereum and integrated with telecom and mobile money platforms globally, aiming to build the standard for Mobile Financial Services 2.0. Our launch product, Telcoin remittances, recently launched in Canada & the Philippines and is available in iOS and Android.
In addition to remittances, Telcoin is working to ship a suite of high quality, affordable, and compliant end user financial products powered by ethereum and TEL holders to a mass market of users. Balancer is a core building block which will power that vision.
TEL, the native asset of the telcoin platform, powers financial transactions, coordinates liquid, TEL holder powered markets for end users, incentivizes telecoms to connect with & provide value to the TEL Ecosystem and Telcoin platform, along with numerous other exciting use cases we will be introducing in the coming quarters.
We view Balancer as the most well positioned automated market maker to bring powerful, novel end user financial use cases beyond speculation to the mass market and we have designed numerous smart pools we intend to commercialize.
The TEL/ETH 80:20 Balancer pool, an active TEL liquidity mining program pool (since October 2020), sits at USD$6.1million TVL and USD$1.4million in 24 hour volume. TEL liquidity providers have already begun voting on proposals with their mined BAL tokens. We view the idea that users of the Telcoin platform will own and contribute to the governance of the underlying decentralized protocols they use every day as one of the most exciting innovations uniquely enabled by crypto, and, at scale, hope to contribute thoughtfully to the governance of balancer.","['Increase TEL cap to $3M', 'Keep TEL cap at $1M']","[301055.7879490283, 125045.43061136927]",1

152,QmRp7airaNhtzMubQ74XRX2sm3FTX5p8SGQgbU5qirjBMS,[Proposal] Expand the Exchange Gas Reimbursement to all Whitelisted Tokens,"This proposal originally appeared on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) and is faithfully reproduced here along with all proposed amendments.

# The Proposal
For the remaining two weeks of the [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705), expand the list of eligible tokens to include all whitelisted tokens (the same list that is eligible for BAL liquidity mining). The change would take effect starting at 00:00 UTC on Monday, February 8, and we would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy.

# Motivation
The pilot program has gone very smoothly so far, with 929 BAL being distributed to 441 addresses for the first week. Of these addresses, only 171 were LPs also participating in liquidity mining, meaning the other 270 were traders who gained the opportunity to participate alongside LPs in the ongoing distribution of BAL tokens. The second week of the pilot is not yet finished, but so far 1043 BAL are set to be distributed to 433 addresses, 342 of which are _not_ participating in liquidity mining. Only 86 reimbursed addresses are included in both weeks so far, meaning a total of 788 unique addresses have been or will be reimbursed.

For all of us in the Balancer community, the decentralized distribution of governance power  has always been a top priority. The liquidity mining program features an extensive list of over **400** eligible tokens and has been a key contributor to this decentralization, distributing BAL tokens to over **9,000** liquidity providers last week. In contrast, the gas reimbursement pilot so far has only included 5 eligible tokens in order to assess feasibility and reduce gameability at the outset.

But now that the basic, five-token version of the pilot has been validated, it is time to expand it to achieve the same degree of decentralization as the liquidity mining program. To ensure lasting robustness of the governance process, we need to get BAL tokens into the hands of as many Balancer users as possible; and that includes both liquidity providers and traders.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details.

In lieu of the shortlist of eligible tokens included in the original proposal, we would use the existing [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) used for liquidity mining. Swaps between any two of the tokens on the whitelist would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.

153,QmfJWL3Di2CCzWcH1A3YCDsmZhxn3cgeiavBnNWEeopzAg,[Proposal] Balancer Exchange Gas Reimbursement,"# The Proposal
For a **pilot of four weeks** starting at **00:00 UTC on Monday, January 25**, with possible extension until the launch of Balancer v2, we would allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy.

# Motivation
We understand that gas costs and usability issues in Balancer v1 have been a bit of a hindrance for many users. Balancer v2 is on the way and set to improve this situation immensely, but in the meantime we have recently launched the new and improved exchange UI and would be thrilled to invite users to give it a try without incurring undue personal cost.

# Mechanics 
Similar to the current liquidity mining claims process, where calculations are run once for each weekly period and claims are made available via a MerkleRedeem contract. The script used for computing the reimbursements would live off chain, along with the liquidity mining scripts, and it would be fully open source and auditable by anyone.
 
**Eligible transactions**: transactions made from externally owned accounts _directly to_ the Balancer Exchange Proxy (contract address: 0x3E66B66Fd1d0b02fDa6C811Da9E0547970DB2f21). The goal is to target traders who are using the Balancer Exchange UI. We would use _""EOA interacts with Exchange Proxy directly""_ as a heuristic to determine that the trade comes from a user of the Balancer Exchange UI. This should prevent most on-chain arbitrage bots from benefiting from the program, as most make their trades via proprietary smart contracts.

**Eligible swaps**: swaps between two of the following tokens:
* WETH (0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2)
* WBTC (0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599)
* USDC (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48)
* DAI (0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F)
* BAL (0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D)

The token list may be expanded following evaluation of the initial pilot.

It is important to distinguish between a _swap_ and a _transaction_ and to note that a transaction through the Balancer Exchange Proxy can contain a number of swaps; a swap is simply one leg of an exchange transaction. For example, a transaction that routes BAL->WETH->DAI contains two eligible swaps: BAL->WETH and WETH->DAI. Similarly, a transaction that routes ineligible token XYZ through XYZ->WETH->DAI contains only one eligible swap: WETH->DAI, and a direct swap of XYZ->WETH is wholly ineligible. Finally, a transaction that routes a BAL->WETH trade through *two* BAL-ETH pools contains *two* swaps.

The gas reimbursement would be the lowest of either:
1. the total gas effectively used by the transaction; or
2. 100,000 (one hundred thousand) times the number of eligible swaps in the transaction

The gas price used for reimbursing each transaction would be the lowest of either:
1. the gas price of the transaction itself; or
2. the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block

It follows that any transaction totaling less than 100,000 gas per eligible swap and utilizing a gas price less than or equal to the block's median would be fully reimbursed, while others partially reimbursed.

Reimbursements would be made in BAL, while gas is priced in terms of ETH, so a conversion is required. The price oracle would be CoinGecko's API, with the median BAL/ETH price from the week being used for all of that week's reimbursements.

Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.

For this pilot, we would set aside 7,500 BAL tokens per week for four weeks. Tokens would be provided by the Balancer Ecosystem Fund. This is a weekly cap for this pilot, so it will not necessarily be fully used. Data from the week of January 4 shows that about 1,500 BAL would have sufficed for reimbursements, so a 5x overhead of 7,500 BAL would be budgeted to account for an influx of transactions and possible swings in the Ethereum gas price. This program would affect neither the ongoing Liquidity Mining campaign nor Batch #2 of the Ecosystem Fund Grants, as both draw from pots that have already been separately allocated. In case more than 7,500 BAL are needed in a given week, reimbursements will be reduced proportionally.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[1057203.2136084582, 253611.7242401385]",1

🔥_ 🔥 ([Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/hello-world-e3c9a409ea49)) has been working with the Balancer team to develop governance mechanisms that complement the launch of Balancer V2.

At the end of 2020, we proposed [Governance Mining](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-governance-mining/554) to encourage community members and liquidity providers to participate in governance, and to compensate these people for doing so.

One piece to this incentive program is the implementation of a [SourceCred instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) to track contributions to the Balancer Community.

**This proposal looks to leverage SourceCred to distribute 50 BAL per week based on the Cred and Grain scores accumulated by users across both the [Balancer Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance) and the #governance channel in the [Balancer Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us).**

Community members will need to opt-in to this program to be eligible for rewards, with specifics on the process to be finalized pending acceptance of this proposal.

# Motivation
The introduction of ‘soft’ incentives around governance in [Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-sourcecred-trial/2551) and [Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-index-flywheel/447) have improved the quantity, quality and diversity of contributions.

We aim to empower these contributions in the Balancer ecosystem via a suite of governance incentive programs. The [GovFactor](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-govfactor/589) addresses the incentivisation of liquidity provider participation, and we believe that there is a much broader space for participation in the Balancer community from people and groups who may not have the capital to become LPs, or who otherwise choose not to do so.

# Specification
The [Balancer SourceCred Instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) was set up in December 2020 and has been collecting contribution data for the past ~4 weeks.

We propose that BAL tokens are distributed to contributors based on the Cred scores recorded by SourceCred and the subsequent grain (or BAL) scores earned among active participants. For more on how this works, please see [this documentation](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/grain/).

The following specification details our proposed structure for these incentives. Inspiration for the allocations and configuration of this instance were modeled after the [MakerDAO SourceCred Trial](https://makerdao.sourcecred.io/#/explorer).

**Forum Incentives**
The Balancer governance forum is the home to the most important discussions and Balancer Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

This program looks to offer a fixed amount of BAL per month to those contributing in meaningful ways, measured using [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) to track aggregate likes, posts and engagement across all topics.

Balancer’s SourceCred instance is heavily weighted towards the amount of likes received across all posts, rather than the quantity of replies. This enforces a **‘quality over quantity’** approach, rewarding contributions that are deemed valuable by the community through engagement and signal.

**Discord Incentives**
We’ve noticed community members on Discord play an active role in educating new users as well as providing valuable feedback and discussion around protocol governance. Through this integration, we want to create mechanisms for those actions to be easily validated and rewarded.

The first instance of Discord incentives will track activity in the [#governance channel](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us), rewarding participants for meaningful contributions in the same way as forum activity - focused on reactions as opposed to post volume to push towards a ‘quality over quantity approach’.

This program looks to serve as an ongoing medium for community members to be better rewarded for their discussion in Discord, with ambitions to boost the importance of BAL emojis and token-based roles using tools like [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/).

**Funding**
The proposed funding for SourceCred incentives is 50 BAL per week to start.

Please note that this program aims to ramp up in the event that it is successful, and we believe that starting with smaller allocations and building up as time goes on is the best way to approach these incentives.

**SourceCred has an opt-in revenue model of allocating 5% of all BAL tokens distributed through this program back to their community, and we are very much in favor of supporting this intiative.**

# Drawbacks
Some points to consider around the introduction of SourceCred incentives for contributions to the Balancer Forum:

* There is potential for this program to be exploited using bots or through collusion between actors.  We will be monitoring the rewards distributed by the instance and will take action if malicious activity occurs.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[1258951.2000110878, 40095.14862551464]",1

156,QmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG,Proposal: govFactor  ,"This proposal is also on [Balancer's Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-govfactor/589) 

## Summary

Introduce govFactor, an on-chain voting factor of 1.1 for Balancer Liquidity Providers.

If passed, the govFactor will initially be implemented as a 3 month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric. 

## Background

🔥_ 🔥 ([FireEyesDAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao)) has been actively working with the Balancer team over the past few months in an effort to develop a robust suite of governance mechanisms to complement the upcoming launch of Balancer V2.

One of the issues we concluded on: consistent voter participation has historically been an issue for many DeFi protocols. Whether it results in proposals not reaching quorum or only having a small number of participants involved, it’s become obvious that protocols need to drive meaningful voter participation across a diverse group of users.

The govFactor creates a simple incentive mechanism for liquidity providers (LPs) to actively participate in governance. 

## Motivation

As it stands, Balancer liquidity mining encourages passive participation. Liquidity Providers (LPs) simply deposit capital into the protocol and earn BAL. Despite the significant subsidy LPs receive in the form of governance tokens, there’s no expectation or requirement that they actively participate in governance.

This ultimately represents a misalignment as LPs have no incentive to vote despite constantly accruing voting weight. If the suppliers are subsidized by the protocol with governance power, they should be willing stewards of the protocol as well.

This does not mean that LPs MUST participate, but instead **they should have an incentive to participate**. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to incentivize those that service the protocol to help govern it as well, aligning their participation with additional weighting to their weekly liquidity mining rewards. 

## Specification

The govFactor is an on-chain voting incentive for LPs that affects BAL liquidity mining allocations depending on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal. The implementation multiplies BAL amounts each LP gets by their govFactor (1.1 for those who voted, 1.0 for those who did not) and then normalizes all amounts so that the sum is still 145,000 BAL per week. 

The govFactor will operate as an “on/off” switch where LPs that voted on the most recent proposal by signing a transaction turn “on” the factor.

Providers that did not vote on the last proposal by signing a transaction have their govFactor “off”, forfeiting the factor and in turn, receive lower LP rewards than those that voted on the last proposal. This dynamic will remain “off” until the next on-chain proposal is open for voting and ratified on-chain.

If all LPs vote, then the rewards remain the same as if no one votes.

 **To make calculations as simple as possible, govFactor would be applied after all other factors.**

GovFactor looks at addresses who have voted on the most recent proposal featured on Snapshot and references to see if the address is also providing liquidity to the protocol. If both variables are met, the protocol includes a factor to their weekly BAL liquidity mining allocation.

It’s important to note that this reference happens entirely on-chain, meaning there’s no need to cross-link any addresses to a forum or public username.

Ultimately, the **govFactor creates a unified incentive for those that service the protocol to become active governance participants as well** and should be considered by the community as a simple mechanism for encouraging governance participation from the protocol's supply-side actors.  

## Drawbacks

Some points to consider surrounding the GovFactor:

* The end result could be a lot of non-engaged voting, coming from LPs who don't hold meaningful amounts of BAL (even if being large LPs) and who don't really care about Balancer governance, putting little to no effort in the decision process behind their votes.
* The GovFactor encourages LPs to vote through their liquidity mining address, which could pose some issues for opsec conscious users. However, Snapshot now enables delegation from cold wallets which would mitigate this issue. 
* The cadence between different governance proposals is likely to differ. This means that someone who votes on the last proposal preceding a large time gap to the next proposal may see increased liquidity rewards despite not actively participating in governance discussions.
* The state of Balancer Governance is relatively idle and therefore implementing a governance incentive isn’t currently necessary for the success of the protocol.","['Yes: Implement govFactor of 1.1 ', 'No: Do not implement govFactor ']","[490439.11594146665, 12903.189528480218]",1

Now that Batch #1 is complete and the results have been [reported to the community](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/summary-batch-1-of-ecosystem-fund-grants/503), I’d like to propose the allocation of 50K BAL from the Ecosystem Fund for a second batch of grants.

Grants will continue to play a vital role in the growth of the Balancer ecosystem. They are a powerful mechanism to attract and reward high quality projects and services from the community that increase the utility of the Balancer protocol and the vibrancy of our community.

As in [Batch #1](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/first-batch-of-balancer-ecosystem-fund-grants/127),

> Balancer Labs will be responsible for deciding on the specific grant distribution to avoid governance micromanaging the decision process for each single grant. After a grant batch is fully allocated (if there is some left-over, it will be added to the following batch), a report with the grant allocation in that batch will be released to the community and a request for approval of a new batch will be voted on. This dynamics ensures that Balancer Labs has to do a good job at grant distribution since if this is not the case a new batch of grants might not be approved.

**Proposal**

Allocate 50K BAL from Balancer Labs to a variety of teams and individuals who build value-creating projects or provide vital services for the Balancer protocol and community.

Grant sizes equal to or below 1,000 BAL will receive 100% liquid BAL tokens.
Grant sizes above 1,000 BAL will receive BAL tokens that are subject to a 1 year vesting period.

Recipients of vesting grants will also have the option to supply ETH to pair with their granted BAL, converting the grant into the 80/20 BAL/ETH BPT, thus earning compounding fees during the vesting period.

The vesting policy is intended to simultaneously ensure that:

2. We are strongly aligning long-term interests with partners with whom we enter large agreements.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[57267.40074535575, 10217.874794619504]",1

This proposal does not necessarily reflect my ([@rabmarut](https://forum.balancer.finance/u/rabmarut)) personal view. I am relaying the request from the community.

**TL;DR**

Add the recently removed $LEND token back into the liquidity mining whitelist. Because $LEND was already whitelisted, it would be reinstated at its existing cap tier (`cap3`=$10M).

**Context**

The Aave protocol recently introduced a new token called $AAVE to replace their existing token, $LEND. The new token will have a fair amount of functionality within the Aave protocol moving forward, whereas the old token is intended to be deprecated over time as token holders migrate. A 1:1 bridge exists for migrating $LEND to $AAVE, after which the $LEND is forever removed from circulation. At time of writing, there is no fixed timeline for the token migration, but the Aave community may introduce a deadline in the near future.

**Proposal**

This past week, a whitelist request for the new $AAVE token was honored. The typical procedure for token migrations is to directly edit the existing whitelist entry for a token with its new contract address; this is designed to incentivize Balancer LPs to migrate to newer contracts to the benefit of the wider ecosystem. As a consequence, in this particular case, the (very popular) $LEND token is no longer whitelisted on Balancer, having been replaced by the $AAVE token. The spirit of this decision is that $LEND liquidity will become less useful over time while $AAVE liquidity will likely undergo a period of rapid ramp-up.

Some users have expressed frustration at this decision, initially citing tax implications. Other users may have other considerations, including but not limited to the gas costs of a liquidity migration. This proposal provides an opportunity for those users to vote to reinstate the $LEND token to the whitelist such that both $LEND and $AAVE would coexist on Balancer and draw BAL rewards from the liquidity mining program. New tokens typically enter the whitelist at `cap1`, but $LEND is not a new token - having already been whitelisted at `cap3` - so its former cap tier would also be reinstated.

Though undoubtedly some community members would hope that this change may apply retroactively, it doesn't seem fair to any users who already migrated thinking that it would be necessary. This hardly seems the time to set a precedent for retroaction, so hopefully LPs would be satisfied enough with these changes taking effect at 00:00 UTC on Monday, October 12. A week's worth of BAL rewards would be lost to $LEND holders, as the previous whitelist proposal made clear that the token would be removed this week.","['Add $LEND back to the LM whitelist', 'Keep $LEND off the LM whitelist']","[520.782212434369, 151468.58221154843]",0

# Motivation

The **importance of BAL liquidity** can't be overstated:

* *TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY*: it improves trading conditions for all market participants (lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers), allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process;

* *SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES*: a stronger token (with higher price inertia) results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs (liquidity providers) via liquidity mining;

* *SHARPER GOVERNANCE*: it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors (e.g. larger investors, especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols);

* *BROADER GOVERNANCE*: with no participation from Balancer Labs' shareholders (more on that later), liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace;

* *SAFER GOVERNANCE*: pools are non-custodial and BAL in them retain full voting power (i.e. no need to withdraw liquidity to vote), such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict;

Balancer itself being a DEX, it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized. Finally, it's worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on *centralized* exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks, as illustrated by the episode with STEEM.


# Recapping: how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL [weekly distribution](https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/bal-liquidity-mining) to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the *adjusted* liquidity contributed by each LP. This adjustment is made by applying (i.e. multiplying) a few *factors* to their liquidity measured in dollar terms.

Naturally, the value of those factors can be:
* equal to `1`, having no effect;
* less than `1`, acting as a penalty (when the liquidity is deemed less useful);
* greater than `1`, acting as an extra incentive.

A `feeFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103)) applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees.

**For each pair inside a pool**, we apply:
*  a `wrapFactor` of:
   * `1.0` for uncorrelated pairs (no penalty),
   * `0.2` for [soft pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-wrapfactor-applying-a-0-2-factor-to-soft-pegged-pairs/138),
   * `0.1` for [hard pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/wrapfactor-penalizing-pairs-of-equivalent-tokens-in-liquidity-mining/28); and 

* a `BRF` (BAL & Ratio Factor), which is the combination of a `ratioFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/introduction-of-a-weight-ratio-factor-in-liquidity-mining/15)) and a `stakingBoost ≥ 1` (described in [this proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102) and with further calculation details specified in its [ammendment](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102/4)). 
`BRF = stakingBoost * ratioFactor`
  * If the pair is **not** of type `{BAL & uncapped_token}` (uncapped tokens currently being: WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, BAL), then its `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. the incentive doesn't apply to this pair).

The current `BRF` will only depend on the characteristics of the pool (its tokens and weights), and may have a maximum value of `1.54`. It looks like this:

![image|690x455, 75%](upload://xqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7P.png) 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool, we combine their factors (via [weighted average](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/master/lib/factors.js#L111)) and the result is a `wrapFactor` and a `BRF` for the whole pool. 

Finally, we calculate and apply a `tokenCapFactor` adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum. Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned, all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at $10M each. See more details on [how to calculate it](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) and the [recent changes](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217) to how token caps will evolve.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to have **45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking**.

This extra incentive is:

> all BAL distributed as a result of applying a `stakingBoost > 1` to the liquidity of `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs, from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs.

The remaining **100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs** in all eligible pools, disconsidering the effect of a `stakingBoost` (i.e. all liquidity being subject to `BRF = ratioFactor`).

The constant value now would be: `STAKERS_SHARE = 45000 / 145000`, and we can then calculate the unique value for `stakingBoost` that satisfies this target distribution. 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially, **but in a self-regulated way**. 

The simple yet powerful idea is: as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets **diluted among stakers**, so that our constant target for `STAKERS_SHARE` is met.

In a more visual approach:
 
* when non-shareholder BAL liquidity is low, the `stakingBoost` will be high, resulting in a high `BRF` (a hypothetical scenario being the **orange** curve in the graph below, in which `BRF` peaks at `12`), so there will be a *very strong* incentive for BAL liquidity to increase;

* when non-shareholer BAL liquidity is high (the desired scenario), the `stakingBoost` will have come down to lower levels, resulting in a lower BRF (a hypothetical scenario being the **green** curve below, in which `BRF` peaks at `3`).

![image|621x500](upload://oI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IV.png)  

# Calculating the stakingBoost: a practical example

We first calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`: the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors, but with `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. `BRF = ratioFactor`). Let's say the result was $200M.

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that:
```STAKERS_SHARE = (finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / finalLiquidity```

... which can also be stated as:
```finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)```

In our example:
```finalLiquidity = $200M / (1 - 45000/145000) = $290M```

We may apply any temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.

Now to get the desired `stakingBoost`, we only need to ""stretch"" or ""shrink"" the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):

```
(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
```
... which in our example would result in:
```
(290 - 200) / (230 - 200) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost = 3 * tempStakingBoost
```

# Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders (investors, advisors and founders) seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal: to accelerate governance rights distribution. In order to achieve this goal, their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking. This restriction doesn't apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations, for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation.

[Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity staking](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).

Note: wallets currently tagged as ""Balancer: Shareholder XX"" on Etherscan are actually *vesting smart contracts* which hold mostly locked (i.e. yet unvested) BAL. Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch (2020-06-20). When finally vested (i.e. free to transfer), BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract. The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts. All the BAL balance they already hold is vested.

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time, without attempting to subvert the exclusion list. In case some large BAL balances move to third-party custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets (both situations are likely to happen), the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking.

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[189383.3426799447, 3568.5440139865486]",1
166,QmTCRfUvkDr5swnFfYYbf4Vr9MoQyb8Z1kZZR62DnaFerC,Proposal to Update the Whitelist Process,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217)

**TL;DR**

Proposal to modify the token whitelist process from the status quo. The method described circumvents the need for any subjective decision-making at the time of whitelisting, instead favoring a set of purely technical criteria. To protect the liquidity mining program from bad actors, a series of cap tiers is added to the capFactor computation (see the [original capFactor proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) for reference), with the default cap for new tokens being reduced to just $1M of adjusted liquidity.

**Context**

After seven weeks of whitelisting, we've begun to observe some serious contention within/regarding the existing token whitelist process. Namely, it is no longer acceptable for me (@rabmarut) to have subjective control over the list. There has been too much controversy recently about the interpretation of certain listing criteria, and no entity should have the power to make those interpretations.

The current criteria for whitelisting are described in the [original whitelist proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposing-the-token-whitelist-for-bal-distribution/55) and copied below:

1. Token must return boolean success on transfer. If an ERC-20 does not return a bool when transfer() is called, it is broken within Balancer v1. Funds added to Balancer liquidity pools will be irrecoverable, and there is nothing the team can do to intervene; Balancer v1 is a set of immutable smart contracts with no administrative keys.
2. Token must not charge fees on transfer. While not necessarily intended as an attack vector, transfer fees are dangerous for Balancer pools. Every trade or removal of liquidity from pools containing these assets will result in a pool price which is “out of sync” with the true balances. Arbitrageurs can gulp() the pool and then trade with it at liquidity providers’ expense. Among others, all “deflationary” assets fall into this category.
3. Token contract must be verified on etherscan. This metric favors tokens which value transparency and reliability.
4. Token must be listed and have a live USD price feed on CoinGecko. This is the price oracle used for distributing BAL proportional to shares of overall liquidity.
5. Token distribution must be somewhat equitable. This is a highly subjective metric subject to community consensus, but in general the desire is for tokens to be somewhat evenly distributed. If the founders, for example, hold 90% of the supply, there are probably ways in which they can hurt liquidity providers or extract disproportionate BAL rewards by artificially driving up the token’s price.
6. Token must provide some form of “real” value. This is another highly subjective metric, but the idea is for the community to actively filter out tokens which have been promoted as “pump-and-dump” schemes, which could hurt unknowing liquidity providers.

It seems clear that Criterion #6 is far too subjective and therefore prone to the curator's interpretation.

**The Proposal**

Criterion #6 (above) will be removed from the existing list, and Criteria #1-5 will fully govern the whitelisting process. That is, there will be a minimal set of _objective_ criteria for listing: a token must be technically compatible with Balancer, and its distribution must not raise any red flags as to the ability of a single party to game Balancer's liquidity mining program by manipulating either the token's price or supply. These criteria are fully focused on:

1. Protecting Balancer liquidity providers from loss of funds.
2. Protecting the BAL distribution from centralized actors.

The barrier to entry would be quite low for whitelisting tokens, but at any time, if a token is deemed to be either _maliciously harming LPs or gaming the BAL distribution_, it could be removed with a governance vote. Note that this approach passes no judgment on the intrinsic value of a token and leaves liquidity providers to decide for themselves what is and is not a ""good investment"" or a ""legitimate project."" Tokens would never be omitted or removed from the list on subjective merits; rather, one of two explicit removal criteria must be met:

1. There is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that a fraudulent event took place in which token holders lost funds, i.e. an _exit scam_.
2. The token is being used as a BAL farm, thereby disadvantaging other Balancer liquidity providers. For example, perhaps 80% of the token's supply sits in a Balancer pool with a 0.0001% fee, and it draws either very little or mostly inorganic trade volume. Care must be taken not to over-emphasize volume here, but it may _help_ to refine the list of potential manipulators. Another example of BAL farming could be that a single entity launches many different tokens to circumvent the $1M liquidity cap.

In calculating the week's BAL distribution, each token's total liquidity is adjusted by the feeFactor, ratioFactor, and wrapFactor; then the adjusted liquidity is capped at a predefined USD-denominated limit. This capFactor mechanism exists to ensure that no one token can reap a disproportionate share of the week's liquidity mining reward. To mitigate the potential consequences of the permissive listing scheme described above, I propose to make the default cap for each new token quite small. The capFactor system would be modified such that, instead of a single cap (now $10M) applied to all tokens, there would be several tiers of capping:

```
cap1:   $1M
cap2:   $3M
cap3:  $10M
cap4:  $30M
cap5: $100M
```

To ease the transition to this new scheme, the status quo of a $10M cap will be maintained for all existing whitelisted tokens - this puts existing tokens at `cap3`. All new tokens, upon being added to the whitelist, would instead be capped by default at `cap1`. At any time, community members may propose to vote a token into a different cap tier. Though not an explicit requirement, the spirit of these changes would be that of reactive necessity rather than preemptive ranking: if a token's TVL on Balancer nears or exceeds that token's cap, vote to raise the cap to the next tier. All such votes would be conducted with three options, for the sake of fairness of governance:

1. No change
2. Migrate the token up to the next (adjacent) cap tier
3. Migrate the token down to the previous (adjacent) cap tier

Furthermore, the cap tiers themselves can be adjusted in value (scaled up or down) by vote, as market conditions may result in more or less USD-denominated TVL across Balancer pools. These votes would be far less frequent and more flexible in structure.

**Conclusion**

Balancer's liquidity mining program was always designed to be permissive. The introduction of a token whitelist was nothing more than a necessary evil to inhibit known attacks on the BAL token distribution. My hope is that the new cap structure and token removal criteria will prove strong enough to mitigate such attacks moving forward, while still enabling Balancer's trustless and permissionless vision.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[144591.37421735382, 4427.671708031612]",1

The text below is an exact copy of it.

TL,DR 

Proposal to apply a wrapFactor = 0.2 to the liquidity of every pair of soft-pegged tokens for the purposes of liquidity mining distribution, in an effort to attract more useful liquidity to the protocol. 

Context 

The original proposal 2 weeks ago applied a wrapFactor = 0.7 for soft-pegged tokens, i.e. tokens that track the same asset and are naturally highly correlated. These are being called soft-pegged pairs. Example: {USDC & mUSD}. 

Liquidity in soft-pegged pairs usually attracts relatively little trading volume on Balancer while at the same time exposing liquidity providers to a lower risk of impermanent loss. Many community members have expressed their concerns about this type of liquidity being unfairly highly compensated by the current mining distribution rules with their less useful liquidity. The introduction of 0.7 wrapFactor did not stop the explosion in size of soft-pegged pools chasing low risk yield on Balancer. Majority of publicity that Balancer recently got was related to sky high rewards for supplying soft-pegged liquidity. 

After much debate, it seems that 0.2 is a reasonable compromise. This value could be revised (up or down) at some point in the future, according to community sentiment regarding the practical results observed. This is unlikely to happen within the next month.

The Proposal 

For every pair, we analyze: 

Is this a hard-pegged pair? If so, wrapFactor = 0.1; 
If not, is this a soft-pegged pair? If so, wrapFactor = 0.2; 
If not, wrapFactor = 1.0 (i.e. no liquidity adjustment from the wrapFactor). 

Examples of soft-pegged groups: 
`{WBTC, renBTC, pBTC, sBTC, imBTC, cWBTC, BTC++}` (all track BTC), 
`{DAI, cUSDT, mUSD, USDC, sUSD, USD++, TUSD, yUSD-SEP20, aUSDT, aTUSD, aUSDC, aBUSD, oaUSDC, aSUSD, USDx, aDAI, yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD}` (all track USD), 
etc. 
All the above are pooled on Balancer. 

Further Considerations 

All liquidity in compliant ERC20 tokens is welcome in Balancer pools, but BAL distribution is a scarce weekly resource (i.e. for an LP to get more BAL, other LPs have to get less). Penalizing soft-pegs is the equivalent of giving an extra incentive for liquidity that has shown itself more useful to the protocol. The 0.2 value has been seen (by most community members) as a reasonable measure, that will be good for the future of Balancer. 

We feel that liquidity composition on Uniswap is natural, while the composition on Balancer is highly skewed towards soft-pegged assets due to very generous rewards. We hope that liquidity composition will improve with wrapFactor 0.2. 

Many believe that the pools like the extreme examples below are earning rewards that are too generous: 
`WBTC-imBTC-pBTC-sBTC:` 1.2m liquidity, $0 24h volume 
`cUSDC-cUSDT:` $1.3m liquidity, $0 24h volume 
`cUSDC-cUSDT:` 1m liquidity, $0 24h volume 
`cUSDC-cDAI:` 200k liquidity, $0 24h volume`cUSDC-cDAI:` 200k liquidity, $0 24h volume","['Approve', 'Reject']","[328416.10812719975, 20655.04290565102]",1

### TL,DR

Proposal to approve the first batch of grants of the Balancer ecosystem fund. This first batch will be comprised of 100k BAL, future batches will likely be smaller. To recap, [the idea of this 5M BAL fund](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/bal-is-live-104ba56e1945) is to attract and incentivize strategic partners/stakeholders that will help the Balancer ecosystem grow and thrive.

### Context

There are many projects and protocols that may want to integrate and/or build on Balancer. This is probably one of the most important areas for Balancer to thrive as a protocol and defend itself from new entrants or copycats. In many cases, it makes sense for Balancer to incentivize these integrations as these partners may need some extra motivation for them to feel staked within the Balancer ecosystem. Grants can also help partners convince their communities that Balancer is the right protocol to integrate their liquidity/users with.

Balancer Labs will be responsible for deciding on the specific grant distribution to avoid governance micromanaging the decision process for each single grant. After a grant batch is fully allocated (if there is some left-over, it will be added to the following batch), a report with the grant allocation in that batch will be released to the community and a request for approval of a new batch will be voted on. This dynamics ensures that Balancer Labs has to do a good job at grant distribution since if this is not the case a new batch of grants might not be approved.

### The Proposal

A 100k BAL first batch of grants to be allocated by Balancer Labs to many teams/projects that are building on / contributing to Balancer. 

All the grants have the long term alignment of incentives with Balancer protocol. Therefore, all grants awarded in this first batch will be given out as follows:
* **90% of the grant is vested** linearly over 1 year (ensured by a smart contract)
* **10% of the grant is unlocked**, but teams are expected **not to sell** these tokens, instead to distribute them to their project users or to hold them for voting on Balancer governance proposals.

### Further Considerations

Balancer Labs has started working with strategic partners and giving grants since before BAL was even launched. Many grants were given out based on the seed price of $0.60 per BAL, so this is why the high number of BAL tokens in this first batch. Future batches will probably be of 50k BAL, as individual grants are going to be a lot smaller given the current market price of BAL.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[129001.24616121154, 10.402547076892398]",1

TL,DR
Proposal to apply a wrapFactor = 0.7 to the liquidity of every pair of soft-pegged tokens for the purposes of liquidity mining distribution, in an effort to attract more useful liquidity to the protocol.

Context
The original proposal approved about a month ago applied a wrapFactor = 0.1 for hard-pegged tokens, i.e. tokens that are equivalent to each other. Example: {USDC & cUSDC}.

Read more: wrapFactor: penalizing pairs of equivalent tokens in liquidity mining 3

Since then, we have seen the rise of pools that are not subject to that wrapFactor, but contain tokens that track the same asset and are naturally highly correlated. These are being called soft-pegged pairs. Example: {USDC & mUSD}.

Liquidity in soft-pegged pairs usually attracts relatively little trading volume on Balancer while at the same time exposing LPs to a lower risk of impermanent loss. Many community members have expressed their concerns about this type of liquidity being unfairly highly compensated by the current mining distribution rules with their less useful liquidity. Some believe the wrapFactor for the soft-pegged pairs should be as low as 0.3. Others believe it should not apply at all.

After weeks of much debate, it seems 0.7 is a reasonable compromise. For being a contentious topic, a final decision has been postponed until a voting tool using BAL tokens was implemented. This value could be revised (up or down) at some point in the future, according to community sentiment regarding the practical results observed.

The Proposal
For every pair, we analyze:

Is this a hard-pegged pair? If so, wrapFactor = 0.1;
If not, is this a soft-pegged pair? If so, wrapFactor = 0.7;
If not, wrapFactor = 1.0 (i.e. no liquidity adjustment from the wrapFactor).
Other examples of soft-pegged pairs:

{renBTC & WBTC} (both track BTC),
{DAI & cUSDT} (both track USD),
etc.
Further Considerations
All liquidity in compliant ERC20 tokens is welcome in Balancer pools, but BAL distribution is a scarce weekly resource (i.e. for an LP to get more BAL, other LPs have to get less). So penalizing soft-pegs is the equivalent of giving an extra incentive for liquidity that has shown itself more useful to the protocol. The 0.7 value has been seen (apparently by most community members) as a conservative measure, that doesn’t drastically alter the current incentives for liquidity and is an adequate value with which to move forward.","['Approve', 'Reject']","[284516.3998571953, 12340.22444994485]",1

The content below has been slightly edited for clarity on a text-only format (e.g. equations substituted from image to text).
__

Proposal to modify the feeFactor curve by changing the exponential coefficient from 0.5 to 0.25. The effect would be to reduce the liquidity mining penalty for high-fee pools, thereby incentivizing a shift toward more profitable fees for liquidity providers.

Motivation

While the core motivation for liquidity mining is the equitable distribution of protocol governance power, economic incentives inevitably attract profit seekers. As such, it is important to align the incentives of those profit seekers with the best interests of the Balancer protocol. Liquidity providers may initially be attracted to Balancer by the profit opportunity that liquidity mining represents, but whether they ultimately stay with the protocol depends on their ability to generate revenue independent of BAL rewards. Above all, Balancer seeks to attract sustainable, long-term liquidity.

At present, the feeFactor curve is quite steep. Swap fees over 0.5% are sharply penalized, with rewards dropping into “negligible” territory around a 5% fee. There are two key consequences of this:

Liquidity providers will set fees as low as possible in order to maximize BAL yield. Many existing pools with fees around ~0.1% are unprofitable in the absence of the BAL distribution and will not be able to outpace impermanent loss in the near future.

Liquidity providers will not bother to weigh the tradeoffs of high trading fees, as >3%-fee pools will not earn much BAL at all and it is quite trivial to earn a high return by just parking some liquidity in a low-fee pool. This creates a disincentive toward certain novel use cases of Balancer such as the “swing trading” strategy proposed by Fernando here: https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/high-fee-balancer-pools-for-swing-trading-8bc1c169a4c2

The Proposal

The current fee factor takes the following form:

feeFactor = exp( -(fee/2) ^ 2 )

It can be generalized, replacing the constant factor (1/2) in the exponential with a coefficient called k.

feeFactor = exp( -(k*fee) ^ 2 )

This proposal is to change the value of this coefficient, k, from 0.5 to 0.25. This will have the effect of shifting the feeFactor curve to the right:

<image showing the two feeFactor curves side by side>

Practical Consequences

The effect on various common swap fees can be computed. Here are the results of the proposed change, taking the format (swap fee : old feeFactor => new feeFactor), where feeFactors are rounded to two decimal places.

TL,DR

Proposal to apply a balFactor = 1.5 to the liquidity of every “useful BAL pair”, i.e. { BAL & one of the uncapped tokens (currently WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC) }, along with a capFactor to BAL adjusted liquidity (i.e. after applying the other factors: ratio, wrap, fee) in case it exceeds $50M. The goal is to increase the incentive for liquidity provisioning with BAL, which should increase BAL liquidity therefore providing better conditions for a wider distribution of BAL ownership.

Context

Users @jammy, @Lex Moskovski and others at the #liquidity-providers channel on Balancer’s Discord came up with the idea of increasing incentives for BAL pools. After a lot of considerations from multiple people and refining on that initial idea, the community ended up voting (on 2020-07-10) on the creation of a balFactor:

<image with Discord voting results: balFactors of 1 and 1.5 were the vast majority of votes>
 
As it was bound to happen at some point, Discord voting was not enough to reach consensus, and a final decision on the matter was postponed until a voting tool could be implemented taking into account the BAL (governance tokens!) balance of each community member.

The Proposal

Application of a capFactor in similar terms as described in the original capFactor proposal (https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56), limiting the BAL adjusted liquidity to $50M.

After the capFactor for all capped tokens has been calculated (to correct down an eventually excessive adjusted liquidity for each capped token), a balFactor of 1.5 is applied to every pair of type {BAL & uncapped_token}.

Further Considerations

Pairs with capped tokens do not qualify for the balFactor, so that pairs of questionable trading demand/utility (e.g. {BAL & cBAT}) are not incentivized.

The $50M cap is more of a safety measure, in place just for the unlikely scenario where the balFactor results in huge and unnecessary BAL liquidity coupled with an unreasonable BAL price spike. Such a scenario is automatically neutered by the cap. For instance, with $100M of BAL adjusted liquidity, the liquidity in all BAL pairs is cut in half for the purposes of liquidity mining distribution (i.e. capFactor_BAL = min(100M, 50M)/100M = 0.5, as explained in the capFactor proposal).Read the formatted version of this proposal at:

TL,DR

Proposal to apply a balFactor = 1.5 to the liquidity of every “useful BAL pair”, i.e. { BAL & one of the uncapped tokens (currently WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC) }, along with a capFactor to BAL adjusted liquidity (i.e. after applying the other factors: ratio, wrap, fee) in case it exceeds $50M. The goal is to increase the incentive for liquidity provisioning with BAL, which should increase BAL liquidity therefore providing better conditions for a wider distribution of BAL ownership.

Proposal by @ross, @ethe, @feddas, @Designer, @chilly\
7/7/2020

---

There was [a snapshot vote that recently passed](https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x48be1e680491b50416595d0a9a9f3e4b233edbf6b9977623fda63b1b5af3d3fc) to allow redemption of the assets in the YAM treasury with YAM tokens, with 54% voting for, 46% voting against, and meeting 410% of quorum (2.05M YAM voting). This vote was put up without any announcement or presentation in the public governance discussion spaces of the DAO (Discord and/or Discourse Forum) and passed on a last minute push.

As a DAO, we are beholden to the will of the token holders, and so this vote passing is a big event and must be respected. With that said, we are beholden to ***all token holders*** and the fact that this vote was created in what could be considered a sneaky and underhanded way cannot be ignored. A vote of this magnitude should be thoroughly discussed and announced, with ample time for stakeholders to weigh in and vote. There are rules around creating proposals and giving sufficient notice to token holders to make a decision. An unannounced vote does not meet these criteria.

Instead of making a unilateral decision that this vote is invalid, we recommend that it be re-proposed via the proper channels and announce it widely so that all token holders have the ability to weigh in and ample time to understand the issues and vote. If those who proposed the vote believe that a treasury redemption is the will of the YAM token holders then they should have no problem with a well publicized vote.

## The Proposal

>***How much you would receive per YAM: ~ $0.25***
>
>Yam is trading at a significant discount to its book value. This proposal would allow token holders who would like to exit to do so and allow long term holders to remain. The primary argument against doing so has been that it would hurt the projects future by draining the treasury to the point where development cannot continue. This is provably false for several reasons with the main being that well over 80% of the YAM supply is in wallets that do not move and can be seen as stagnant as well as not voting or delegating. This means that a very significant percentage of the treasury will remain to sustain years(at the current burn rate) of future development for those who decide to hodl.

>This is an off chain proposal to gauge if an on chain proposal should be made in order to determine if the majority of active and voting yam holders would like to have the option to redeem their yam from the equivalent ratio of the treasury assets.

This vote will be up for a week after it is posted to the discord and socials, with another week to vote on snapshot. To ensure fairness, the snapshot block for the new vote will be set to the same snapshot block as the original vote. The votes will be announced on the discord, this forum, and via the official YAM Twitter.

One editorial note: The redemption price listed in the text above is innacurate. You can see the value and composition of the treasury [here](https://dune.com/ethedev/Yam-Dashboard). There is ~$3.16M in the treasury and the  supply of YAM is 14,692,088. That Yields a redemption value of ~$0.224 per token (as of 2022.07.19). This number will be subject to change as the value of the treasury changes, and the number of YAM increases by 12,000 weekly due to liquidity mining incentives.

Currently as we have discussed changes in terms of how we pay contributors, based off of their focuses, this proposal is for E to continue with his research alongside feedback collection from the community, forming a well suitable yam core development plan to proceed with the developments and to form the operations team that will support yam stability.

# Abstract

@e: Working on constructing the development plan with top most priorities we need including to other elements i described in the [Yam Core Development](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-core-development/1689), where it will be split into smaller pieces to eventually get us to the long term vision that i have been discussing and pushing for. Ultimately a simplified high level timeline will be there to display most of its contents. In addition to working with the team for us to finalize and form the operations council with what will be ongoing, to generally be organized in support of the yam protocol, where i also include my responsibilities for infrastructure and maintenance.

- **Goals:**
    - Collect feedback and priorities from the community.
    - Update and finalize the first piece of the core development plan.
    - Create the high level dev timeline and begin with the first part.
    - Form the operations council and continue infrastructure maintenance.
- **Comp:** E fulltime monthly comp rate of $9917 in USDC and $4250 in YAM tokens based on the 30day avg value.
- **Covers:** Jun-Jul 2022. (As we figure things out, i will revisit the goals with a potential update to begin with the developments around July and for August).

**Note:** Pushing to finalize the development plan the sooner to begin with it around July, for the operations i believe we can have it ready by mid July.

Yam is trading at a significant discount to its book value. This proposal would allow token holders who would like to exit to do so and allow long term holders to remain. The primary argument against doing so has been that it would hurt the projects future by draining the treasury to the point where  development cannot continue. This is provably false for several reasons with the main being that well over 80% of the YAM supply is in wallets that do not move and can be seen as stagnant as well as not voting or delegating. This means that a very significant percentage of the treasury will remain to sustain years(at the current burn rate) of future development for those who decide to hodl.

This is an off chain proposal to gauge if an on chain proposal should be made in order to determine if the majority of active and voting yam holders would like to have the option to redeem their yam from the equivalent ratio of the treasury assets.

There are several simple and secure solutions for the implementation of this if chosen by the community. The most obvious and secure solution would be to utilize the exact same smart contract used by Louis to dissolve it’s treasury holdings: https://etherscan.io/address/0x889dfe07caa0baf3814ddcd1b933d208d9913b5e

This vote is to continue executing on the Yambassadors Silo work to make the UMA in the treasury productive.

In the past month we have executed on the initial UMA voting proposal that you can find here: https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x686972cf540720430d3fc4109664b2136da98d85837e75860f161b51ba8b1890

The steps that have been carried out:
    - Created the 2-key contract (before the last vote)
    - Send UMA to contract from treasury in the last on-chain transaction
    - Removed UMA from contract to treasury in the last transaction (it is now in Timelock, but same thing)
    - I voted successfully in an UMA DVM vote
    - I claimed the voting reward successfully

The next steps according to the original proposal are to send the rest of the UMA to this contract now that it has been successfully tested, and to write documentation. This vote is to ratify sending the balance of the Treasury UMA to the 2-key Contract. Methodology to send is the same as the last on-chain transaction and is laid out in the specification below.

Currently as we have discussed changes in terms of how we pay contributors, based off of their focuses, this proposal is for E to continue with his research alongside feedback collection from the community, to form a well suitable yam core development plan and move forward with it, scoped with updated docs that were started on, this proposal also includes other recurring focuses that E normally handles.

# Abstract

***Background:** Contributions E has made to Yam are numerous from the very beginning of the launch to date, focusing mostly on its core development, stability and security with facilitating and assisting every contributor we ever had on Yam. E believes for yam to gain further values, on a protocol level it must accomplish several milestones and be up to the level and base standards to lead by example (as uniswap aave compound optimism uma chainlink and others …), which from comes the main purpose of the yam dev documents that E has been working on and recently posted for further feedback collection. E believe going through this path will give yam a solid core yet a scalable and attractive model with value add long term.*

### A. Yam Core Development (Planning)

For June and July, as i have already begun will continue progressing on figuring out the long term core vision of the yam protocol development plan as outlined on the [Yam Core Development](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-core-development/1689), [Yam Protocol Multichain](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-protocol-multichain/1688) and the linked docs. My main objective prior getting into any dev work is to complete forming the mentioned with further planning, specifications and timeline updates. Which from and once fully scoped, i am going to propose and proceed with to entirely start focusing on.

### B. Yam Infrastructure

For the next 3 quarters (Q3, Q4 2022, Q1 2023), i will continue maintaining infrastructure, services upkeep and the onchain activity in terms of proposal contracts development, testing, deployments, proposing, execution and following up through, as well for basic assistance, data collection from snapshots and individuals to progress forward. This however does not include things that consists of feature implementation, for example the creation of another contract or a focus that it can relate to, although i will give a feedback to whichever extent of my ability in terms of ideating around a feature request. This includes the usual of being there and help facilitate things.

**For June and July:**

- **Goals:**
    1. Finalize / update the core development plan.
    2. Collect feedback from the community.
    3. Finalize the high level specs / timeline to proceed with the development.
    4. Maintaining monthly the mentioned specifications under “B. Yam Infrastructure”.
- **Comp:** E monthly rate of $9917 in USDC and $4250 in YAM tokens based on the 30day avg value.

**Recurring, after finishing with (A.):**

- **Goals:** Maintaining monthly the mentioned specifications under “B. Yam Infrastructure”.
- **Comp:** Monthly rate of $3850 in USDC and $1650 in YAM tokens based on the 30day avg value.

@e: Note i am pushing to finalize the plan as mentioned in A. and sooner, to then start with it around July, taking into account any changes needed which for i would revisit this section with an update accordingly. Now focusing on both Yam Core Development (Planning) and Yam Infrastructure, then once finished with A. around July i will proceed with the upcoming development while i keep maintaining the Yam Infrastructure.

3. Project Name :building_construction:
What should we call your project?

Answer:
Yam Treasury Management and Maintenance Framework

4. Project Description :thinking: (140 words or less)
*Give a summary of the project you are proposing *

Answer:
Yam’s treasury is the centerpiece of Yam DAO. It is currently valued at approximately $3.1 million (estimated 6.22.22). Here’s a current dune dashboard: Dune
**This proposal is to create a framework for consistent evaluation and rebalancing of the treasury. **
I assisted in building and designing Yam’s current treasury management system along with DAO House a Yam treasury management as a service for other DAOs. Now there is sufficient historical data on Yam’s treasury and expenses to design a long term framework for anyone to manage and maintain Yam’s treasury.

5. About You :busts_in_silhouette:
Tell us about you and your team. What experience do you and your team have that is relevant to the project. Please provide github profiles, websites, prior work, etc

Answer:
I’ve been a contributor to Yam Dao since the start of YamV3, here’s my first public forum post in Oct 2020 for Yam:

Since we are discussing team compensation right now, I will put this on hold and create a new topic when we’ve solidified team compensation plans.
Since then I designed proposed and gotten approved the first initial design of the Yam Treasury Strategy and allocation. I spearheaded the Treasury Management as a Service for DAOs project that was a collaboration between tokensets.com and Yam. The largest client being SushiSwap that invested $10 million of their treasury into the service. My primary focus is and was treasury management.
Here’s a historical public record of some of the work that I’ve done @ Yam DAO:
Profile - feddas - Yam Forum

6. Project Goals and Scope :rocket:
If the project succeeds, what goals will it achieve? How do we measure that success? Please provide specific KPIs. If you are unsure of how to do this, do the best you can and we can work it out together.

Answer:

Requirements Doc
a. Will be published for feedback/snapshot before moving to step 2.
Evaluate current investment strategy of a moderately portfolio targeting < 0.75 Beta and < 0.5 Correlation.
a. Things have changed now that we are no longer in the middle of a bull market, in addition there have been significant changes to Yam DAO and its expenses. Taking these considerations into account to evaluate for long term success of Yam DAO is now more prudent than ever.
b. Also there are significant limitations for a DAO managed Treasury that personal investment portfolios do not have. Due to my previous work with Yam, I’ve worked thru many of these issues and will be able to give a better comprehensive portfolio.
Make recommendations based on results from #1.
a. Should we change strategy targets? Maybe move to a % allocation model since crypto in general is highly correlated and there are not any good counter balances to crypto within the guidelines of a DAO Treasury.
b. What and why are the recommendations appropriate for Yam DAO and the long term future.
Create a framework for rebalancing and maintenance of the treasury.
a. Successful treasury management requires maintenance of the assets.
b. Framework will be a step by step guide with necessary tools to signal for the need to rebalance the treasury and then provide the way to do it.
c. Framework will need to be adjusted if there are significant changes to the types of assets or expenses of the DAO but general guidelines will be provided.
Steward recommendations thru Yam governance, adjust if needed and assist in applying changes to Yam Treasury.
Nice to have: Create a framework that is not specific to Yam’s Treasury and can be applied to other treasuries potentially useful to reinvigorate Yam’s DAO house as a service.
7. Milestones :placard:
What are the steps that you plan to follow to complete this project. Is it one step or multiple? If there are multiple then please list all of them.

Answer:

Requirements Doc
Evaluate current investment strategy of a moderately portfolio targeting < 0.75 Beta and < 0.5 Correlation. Make recommendations.
Create a framework for rebalancing and maintenance of the treasury.
Steward recommendations thru Yam governance, adjust if needed and assist in applying changes to Yam Treasury.
8. YAM / Ecosystem Benefit :blush:
What value does your project add to YAM and the wider ecosystem? How do we measure that benefit?

Answer:
Seeing the rise and the correction of crypto in the lens of DAO treasury management since the start of YamV3 has been fascinating. There have been multiple DAOs / protocols who decided to ignore treasury management and are suffering now because of it. Unfortunately crypto as a whole moves in cycles until this is broken, it is prudent to plan around these cycles. In the heat of the moment it is easy to double down when you should be thinking about the worse case scenario.
**This proposal provides a long term reusable framework that will provide regular rebalancing and flexibility to be used as a base for YAM’s DAO treasury management for many cycles to come. **

9. Funding Request and Breakdown :money_with_wings:
Please include the total funding amount that you need and also include a breakdown of how the funds will be used across each part of the project.

Answer:
Multiple parts of this proposal will be published publicly with request for feedback. I anticipate the need to work 25 hours a week due to the time it takes for public feedback and Yam governance timing.

This grant application is the second grant within the existing [Yam Design Studio Silo](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-design-studio/). For this grant the Design Studio intends to change from a monthly to a quarterly grant period.

The purpose of the quarterly grant is to streamline the process on long-term and or ongoing Silo projects. The desired effect is a lighter governance load so both silo participants and token holders are less bogged down in unneeded governance processes.

## Quarterly Grant

This quarterly (3 month) grant request serves as a funding container. It will work as follows:

1. Each silo participant provides an hourly range with a monthly not to exceed maximum
2. At the end of each month transparency reports are filed by the silo participants
3. Payments are paid on a monthly basis based on the actual hours worked
4. Token holders always retain the ability to stop a silo by submitting a Snapshot proposal

## Why Quarterly?

Besides the reduced management overhead, the advantage to the silo structure is that it provides a high level of flexibility for the silo participants to manage their own time and project. The idea is to avoid participant burn out, apathy or abandonment of projects through striking a balance between freedom and accountability. Flexible hourly commitments can encourage long-term participant involvement while providing a mechanism that allows for payment of the work the participant is able to provide each given pay period.

## Goals and Deliverables

**Yam Super Site**

- Incorporate the work of the Yam Re-Org Silo into the new site, with accompanying visual graphics, infographics, and brand imagery.

**Yam Re-Org Social**

- Showcase and publish the Yam Re-Org ideas on our socials and medium.

**Branding Graphics for Grant Application**

- Create graphics for the grant application that showcase the flow on how to get involved with Yam.

**Yam Re-Org Campaign**

- Develop a marketing campaign to showcase the ideas of the Yam Re-Org.

Complementary Initiatives:

- Metaverse Build Development for community outreach + growth in the metaverse.
- Community Event in the Metaverse. 

## Funding Amount Requested:

Total amount to be split 70% in USDC and 30% in YAM at the 30-day TWAP price on the first day of the month after the month for which compensation is being requested.

We think this is a good beta test for this kind of grant structure within an ongoing silo project.

## Goals and Deliverables

Over the 3 month grant period we will focus on refining and documenting the following:

### Design of Core Reorg

Re-Org Docs (YAM RePlanted) and synopsis articles.

- Concise statement of the Yam ReOrg project purpose and main objectives (90% complete)
- Article 1: What makes a good DAO - documentation that serves as a guiding target (80% complete)
- Article 2: Goals for a new Yam DAO - success definition and specific goals (80% complete)
- Article 3: New Yam DAO model - how grants, silos and a gov-ops council will work (50% complete)
- Diagramming and refinement (30% complete)

#### Milestone 1: 
Substantial completion of all above to hand off for presentation work by YAM Design Studio Silo on June 27th.

After completion of Reorg Docs, Develop Templates for:

- Pre-grant application
- Project Requirements document
- Grant Application
- Counter-Bid document
- Grant objection document

These documents to be worked on as part of milestone 2.

### Presentation and Consensus

- Present new Yam DAO model and communication materials once completed by YAM Design Studio. (early-mid July)

- Coordinate with Chilly to present documents and articles on the new supersite website, twitter, medium, etc.

- Respond to questions, concerns, etc.

- Formally present content for review and feedback to confirm consensus among stakeholders.

#### Milestone 2: 
Vote to approve new process and more forward into implementation
Specification and Implementation

- Based on final consensus, begin the specification and implementation process
- Implement enough structure for grants process to begin. Refine and publish templates.
- Specify and begin to implement the Gov-Ops Council.
- Specification and development of “Governance Repo,” the location and process for storing and updating new grants and governance proposals.

### Complementary initiatives:
(to be worked on as time permits)

- Treasury Yield Distribution design
- Governance contract upgrades
- Token Issuance strategy and design
- Vision and Values documentation and ratification
- Protocol owned liquidity strategy and design

Because much of the current work is design focused, the work follows an iterative process in which discoveries in later phases may change the design. We expect that the broad strokes of the re-org are complete and ready to be presented at the end of June, and look forward to getting additional feedback. This feedback may impact the final product and require some re-working. The same goes for the design of the complementary initiatives, although the current design for the re-org has been crafted with them in mind.
Funding Amount Requested:

Total amount to be split 70% in USDC and 30% in YAM at the 30-day TWAP price on the first day of the month after the month for which compensation is being requested. By Contributor:

### Ross:
- Range 25 to 35 hrs/week = $8,500 minimum and $11,900 maximum per month
- (compensation based on $85 per hr)

### Designer:
- Range 20 to 30 hrs/week = $6,800 minimum and $10,200 maximum per month
- (compensation based on $85 per hr)

Work on this grant has already begun (beginning of June) so compensation requests in July will be for the entire month.","['Approve', 'Disapprove']","[281350.34566049674, 0]",1

Per this post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/my-concerns-around-the-yambassadors-silo/1678, I am proposing that we send 2 UMA to the 2-key Delegate contract I recently deployed in order to test it. In the same transaction we would also withdraw 1 UMA to confirm that we can do so.

2 key contract address: 0x8348c5EC31D486e6E4207fC0B17a906A0806550d
https://etherscan.io/address/0x8348c5ec31d486e6e4207fc0b17a906a0806550d

## Specification
The code to be added to the monthly contract is a simple ERC-20 transfer to the 2-key contract and would look like this:

```javascript
IERC20 internal constant UMA = IERC20(0x04Fa0d235C4abf4BcF4787aF4CF447DE572eF828);

UMA.transfer(2keyContract, 2 * (10**18));
```

the code used in the propose transaction to add the UMA would look like this:

```
targets[2] = address(reserves);
signatures[2] = ""whitelistWithdrawals(address[],uint256[],address[])"";

address[] memory whos = new address[](1);
uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
address[] memory tokens = new address[](1);

whos[0] = address(proposal);
amounts[0] = testAmount*(10**18);
tokens[0] = address(UMA);

calldatas[2] = abi.encode(whos, amounts, tokens);
```

The code used in the propose transaction to remove the UMA would look like this:
```
targets[0] = address(2keyContract);
signatures[0] = ""withdrawErc20(address,uint256)"";
calldatas[0] = abi.encode(address(UMA), 1 * (10**18));
```

We need to provide liquidity to our New LSP synths on Polygon when they are ready. In order to do this we must set funds from the treasury, which lives on Ethereum mainnet to polygon, and then manage those funds there. Those funds will be managed with the existing multi-sig that we have deployed on Polygon. In order to increase security, we should upgrade the multi-sig from 2-3 to 3-5.

### Abstract - What am I proposing?

While we work on a longer term, and more decentralized solution, I propose that we send all funds that we plan to use for Polygon liquidity to our existing Polygon multi-sig (https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5553b79f4ee172e76537fd6a43629c44f6034f18) and use it to perform all actions necessary to provide liquidity for Yam Synths.

At the same time, in order to improve the security of this wallet, we should upgrade it from a 2-3 multi-sig to a 3-5 multi-sig.

The current signers for the multi-sig are @ethe, @flygoing.eth, and @HodlDwon. I propose we expand that list to include @ross and @Snake.

### Motivation - Why am I proposing it?

There is easy way to extend the governance functionality that we currently use on Ethereum L1 onto polygon. There are some new solutions available that may work for the task, but they are not going to be possible to implement in the timeframe needed to perform the liquidity allocation mentioned above. We currently have a multi-sig on polygon that we can use. Because the amount of money that it will control is higher than what was previously assumed for the comethSwap program (what it was approved for), I am recommending we add 2 additional signers to increase security.

All signers are on, or have in the past been on the core team and are known around the community.

### Specifications

In order to update the multi-sig, the existing signers would need to modify the existing multi-sig to add the 2 new signers.

### Basic Summary
We need to provide liquidity to our New LSP synths on Polygon when they are ready (expected early November 2021). In order to do this we must set funds from the treasury, which lives on Ethereum mainnet to polygon, and then manage those funds there

### Abstract - What am I proposing?
#### Liquidity allocation
In continuation of the asset allocation from [YIP-83](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-83-re-allocation-of-assets-post-rebalancing/1518), I propose that we send 130 ETH and $1.1M in stablecoins to provide liquidity for our new synths on Polygon.

### Motivation - Why am I proposing it?
We are launching new Synths on polygon as part of a rollout of our new DeFi-Tools product line. We need to continue bootstrapping these pools to grow the Yam Synths product. At the same time, utilizing these funds in our synths earns UMA rewards for the treasury. Yam Synths products are currently earning ~49% APR on ETH, and we can expect similar (most likely higher) returns on the funds we invest. I will have another post soon that goes over liquidity mining on polygon with the new LSP contracts. But the gist is it is easier and more capital efficient than the current model and should pay out higher APRs that currently, up to ~$20M in TVL.   

### Specifications - How am I proposing it is accomplished?
Proposed Treasury Funds to be moved to Polygon multi-sig:
130 ETH to be deployed to the 2xDPI synth
$1.1 M USD to be deployed, split between to the Sushiswap APR Synth and 50x IL synth.

### Introduction

Per this announcement, https://yamfinance.medium.com/3f5f74af044d, Jason, aka punk1004.eth, has been removed as a contributor to YAM and had all permissions removed from github.

Here is the conclusion that the YAM core team has come to after reviewing all the evidence that was presented to us (copied from the statement made on Medium):

1. There are multiple connections between the contributor’s public wallets and the exploiting (bad actor) wallets.
2. There are multiple connections between the contributor’s public github account and the second github account that was used to do work on these other projects that had funds stolen from them.
3. There are connections between the contributor’s github account and Ethereum wallets to other github accounts and other Ethereum wallets that have worked on, deployed, or been the recipient of funds from projects that many would consider to be scams, or at the very least, suspicious.
4. There is circumstantial evidence including chats and a voice recording that seem to match characteristics of the contributor.
5. The distinction of whether this contributor was personally responsible for these actions or unwittingly caught up in the actions of other individuals ultimately does not matter. Their involvement shows extremely bad judgement and is a serious security risk for YAM.

There are additional decisions that need to be made regarding the payment for previous work Jason has done and continued membership on our discord that need to be answered by the YAM community.

### Abstract

Jason / punk1004.eth has been removed as a contributor from YAM and his status as a core team member has been revoked. All access to YAM code, contracts, private chats, etc has been removed. The security risk to YAM has been dealt with. But as of right now punk1004.eth is still a member of the YAM discord.

All should be aware that if banned there is no way to prevent him from creating another account and re-joining the discord. So banning him is a statement rather than a functional action.

Should punk1004.eth be banned from the YAM discord?### Motivation

These decisions are either beyond the scope of what the core contributors believe they should be deciding upon or are unclear on the best course of action. We feel our best way forward is to put these questions to the DAO as a whole and follow the will of the YAM token holders.

There are additional decisions that need to be made regarding the payment for previous work Jason has done and continued membership on our discord that need to be answered by the YAM community.

### Abstract
Contributors are paid in both stablecoins and YAM based on their approved compensation proposals. The YAM is streamed over 3 months and the stablecoins are paid retroactively every month for work done over the past month. Jason’s YAM stream has ended and will not be renewed. His payment in stablecoins typically would be paid in the monthly on-chain vote with the rest of the contributor’s payments.

The question here is whether the DAO thinks that Jason should receive payment for his last month of work. He has performed the work and tasks that he was given over the last month, and the exploit of which he is accused occurred on the 3rd of November, after the period of work for which he would be paid.

### Motivation
These decisions are either beyond the scope of what the core contributors believe they should be deciding upon or are unclear on the best course of action. We feel our best way forward is to put these questions to the DAO as a whole and follow the will of the YAM token holders.

34,QmSYrh4QD3iCgyGTFSMr2meRJddvBdhf9xtDbRH3y6w29A,Implement BuyBack and Build with Profit,"Forum Post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-86-using-profit-to-buyback-and-build/1531

## introduction

The goal of YAM is to build a community who will use the treasury to build new DeFi and crypto products that will generate revenues. Beyond just generating these revenues, how they are allocated is a important consideration. With the passing of [YIP-80](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-80-yam-treasury-rebalancing/1512), we have taken a big step creating a foundation on which we can build. Rebalancing and rationalizing the treasury is only the first step in building a strong foundation for YAM.

There have been numerous calls for a revenue/profit distribution mechanism that benefits YAM token holders, and with a solidified model for treasury management we can now reason about how a mechanism might work.

As we are still an early stage project, any distribution mechanism should only consider profit (revenues minus expenses and returns). YAM has quarterly report in which we enumerate the inflows and outflows from the DAO. The most recent one can be seen here: 
[Yam Treasury Quarterly Report - Q2 2021](https://medium.com/yam-finance/yam-treasury-quarterly-report-q2-2021-23f56a758c87)

Using this information we can develop a plan to create a sustainable model to use profits to fund further growth and development.

## Methodology

Beyond just looking at profits and expenses for the quarter, we also need to adjust for the overall performance of the treasury between quarters. If the treasury is shrinking then there is no profit, even if our operating revenues are larger than our operating expenses. This is important because it should incentivize YAM holders to manage the treasury in a way that limits investment risk and still rewards investment growth. It also promotes revenue growth since that should be less influenced by market cycles.

There are a few metrics we can use to determine whether the DAO is profitable: Overall growth of the treasury or the difference between product revenues and DAO expenses. I believe treasury growth is the primary metric that we should use. This means that, in the context of this buyback, if the treasury did not grow in the most recent quarter then no profits were realized, even if product revenues outpaced expenses. This is the most holistic way to approach the mechanism. 

We can combine a profit buyback mechanism with our need to fund the treasury with YAM to pay contributors. This would create a system where a percentage of profits are use to buy YAM off the open market, which are then used for contributor payments and incentive programs. This model, combined with the ability of the DAO to mint new YAM, provides a framework for which YamDAO can use profits generated to fund itself while also indirectly rewarding token holders, and provide a path to even eventually remove YAM from circulation.

## How it would Work
See the Forum post here for a full write-up of the methodology: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-86-using-profit-to-buyback-and-build/1531

### Other factors
This model creates a number of levers through which governance can influence the project treasury and monetary policy while still prioritizing treasury and project growth. Governance would need to:

1. Determine reasonable payroll and runway figures for contributor compensation. Because YAM may be minted for payroll, this is a parameter that needs to be managed. This includes setting maximum total salaries and the maximum amount of stablecoins that contributors can earn as a portion of their pay. 
2. Determine how much YAM is needed for incentive programs.
3. Set a max yearly or quarterly YAM issuance rate for the treasury to limit overall YAM issuance.
4. Determine the appropriate risk level for the Treasury per YIP-80
5. Determine the `productProfitReinvestment` and `investmentProfitReinvestment` variables to set how much profit is used to buy YAM.

These different parameters will be in included in upcoming snapshot votes. This vote is intended to ratify the general concept and methodology, with further details determined in future votes.

My role will consist of artist curation, artist relations, and metaverse content creation.

This includes contributing in the development of metaverse products by providing relevant experience in both NFTs & DeFi. In addition to facilitating relationships with artists, builders, and fellow DAOs.

It also involves managing relationships with other projects while strategizing on how to build out Yam’s presence in the metaverse with a focus on creating new streams of income for the DAO and catalyzing a new community for artists.
## Requested Compensation

Full time, $4000/month , 60% stablecoins, 40% YAM
## Biography + Skills and experience

I’m a young but very experienced crypto enthusiast who has been learning and experimenting with cryptocurrency technology over the last 4 years.

From 2017 to 2019 I became familiar with Web3 technologies by working as a social media manager for a few different Crypto startups managing telegrams and twitter accounts. At this time i was also starting to learn about earlier DeFi products like Compound, Maker, and Synthetix.

In the beginning of 2020 I got into NFTs.

At this point i had dedicated myself to grinding in the metaverse as hard as I could weather it was earning wearables in Decentraland, selling my own art, and farming SLP in Axie Infinity. Generally trying to hustle as hard as i could in the nascent space.

In doing so i have built up amazing connections with several Decentraland, CryptoVoxels, & Axie Infinity community members as well as some amazing Crypto Artists and builders in the metaverse. More recently I have moderated for Pranksy and his NFT Boxes project.
## Value add to Yam team

I will bring the unique prospective of a metaverse native with over a year of experience using platforms such as Decentraland, Axie Infinity, CryptoVoxels, OpenSea, and Rarible.

This allows me to provide an experienced prospective of all of these communities when building up marketing pushes and dynamic community events.

I will also provide strong relationships between artists and Yam in order to align communities within the metaverse to create with each other. With the goal of generating interest in Yam and driving adoption from creatives in Yam’s community.
## What I’ve done for Yam

Created content for the MoFY Magazine. This includes artists interviews which has allowed us to onboard multiple wonderful artist like Emotionull that will be the basis for future Yam events.

Supplied the team with my prospective when it comes to expanding throughout the space like NFT drops, collaborative events in CryptoVoxels, and our future plans for an NFT art platform.
## What I’m planning to do for Yam

I plan to leverage my connections in order to collaborate with other passionate communities across the metaverse.

This will include:

-providing content on Yam’s featured artists such as articles and collaboration. ex: wearables, CryptoVoxel art installations, artist interviews and, NFT articles.

-Contributing to Yam’s new project (Museum of Modern Yams) which aims to create a symbiotic relationship between these on boarded artists and the DAO.

-Foster the Yam/MoFY community for artists, virtual land builders and, content creators to build a strong feedback loop of the DAO and artists generating value towards each other.

> The compensation for Snake is set at YAM 12,800/month (rate at $0.75/YAM based on the 30d avg.) + Stablecoin $2,400/month, equaling $12k/month ($144k/yr).

38,QmdU2Xq6C4Ljrqm37Qz2pGzSKwESwDhohR3yYrDth28h5P,YIP-85 - New Human Resources Group,"
### Abstract 

This is a proposal to create an new internal group of contributors who will meet monthly and is empowered to make staffing decisions, propose new hires, propose pay changes, and propose removal of contributors.

The goal of this group is to streamline the contribution process and provide a resource for all contributors to better understand what is expected of them and clear up any problems that arise. It will serve as the primary interface between contributors and governance in matters of compensation and employment.
### Motivation 

The current structure to organize contributors and keep them accountable is not clearly defined. Contributors apply directly to governance to be hired/paid but they typically discuss this beforehand with the existing contributors to determine what their proposal should look like. This process is informal and has typically been done by members of the operations guild. This proposal formalizes what is already happening and makes it clear for all parties.

#### Hiring
The HR group will formalize the arrangement for new contributors who are looking to be hired with the support of the existing contributors. It will provide a way for the current contributors to signal to governance about whether they think a hire is necessary and beneficial.

#### Compensation Changes
In order to streamline compensation updates for contributors, the HR group will compile and propose compensation updates to present to governance for approval. This will typically happen on 6 month intervals as streams complete, but there may be other requested updates in between.

#### Firing
This model provides a framework for governance to get information about contributors who are not performing as specified in their proposals to be removed or have their compensation adjusted. This information is not easily available for YAM token holders. The HR group will make recommendations about compensation changes or removing contributors who are not living up the the standards of the DAO.
### Specifications 

Specifications for this are soft as this is an organizational change. Unless specifically disapproved, this group will begin work immediately.

- This group will meet monthly at minimum to discuss HR and staffing needs for the DAO.
- This group will make recommendations to governance on Hiring and HR decisions. YAM holders still need to discuss and approve these recommendations.
- Approval from the HR group is not required to be hired by the DAO. Anyone can appeal directly to governance. Contributors who are recommended for firing can also appeal directly to governance.
- This group with start with 4 members and 1 alternate (to break any deadlock)
- There is a 1 year term limit for members of this group. They can serve more than 1 term, but must be ratified for future terms.
- Group members are initially put forward by existing contributors
   - Proposed contributors for the first term are 0xE, Natew, Chillzone, and Ross, with the alternate being Feddas.
- Being a member of the HR group does not pay extra or have any added benefits.

### Introduction
This is a proposal to update the contributor compensation framework for those who are working full and part-time for YAM. It increases the % of pay that can be received in stable-coins and changes the vesting period for YAM earned.

To understand what is changing, I recommend reading this post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/analysis-of-current-compensation-model/1526

### Goals

I propose to create a more standard and simple model where contributors can elect to be paid mainly in stable-coins, up to a predetermined cap, while always maintaining a portion of their pay in vested YAM. The core goals of this proposal are:

1. Contributors being able to pay their bills.
2. Contributors core pay not being affected by market fluctuations (unless they want it to).
3. Making sure contributors have some of their income exposure in Yam to help align and incentivize.

### Details

- Pay will continue to be broken down into 2 portions: Stablecoins and YAM.
   
   1. All contributors will be able to take up to 70% of their pay in stablecoins. This is their base pay and is expected to be sufficient for the contributor to pay their bills. This will be paid in the stablecoins, either DAI or USDC.
   2. The rest is an incentive payment in YAM, which has a new vesting graded vesting of 6 months similar to how SNX rewards are vested (linear vesting begins 6 months after YAM is earned).YAM is deposited into the stream at the beginning of the 6 month period and is inaccessible for 6 months. Once the 6 month mark has been hit, the stream starts and the funds are released over the next 6 months.
- YAM quantities paid out will be determined based on a 1month TWAP similar to how it is currently done, but streams will be funded on 6 month intervals (same length as vesting start).
- If a contributor wants to receive a larger percentage of their pay in YAM, they can do so without vesting (30% will always be vested). We expect that contributors who do this will not sell their YAM immediately.

### Implementation

This proposal is to create a framework which we will then apply the current contributors as streams end and need to be updated. After discussion, this framework will be put up for a snapshot vote. Once approved, a separate proposal will be made to apply the changes to contributors. Assuming it is approved before Oct. 1st, then it would be applied to the contributors whose streams end then. “OG” contributors streams end in December and these changes would applied at that point.

The stream mechanism may need to be updated to allow for the 6 month delay in vesting. Dev work will be coordinated to make that happen.","['Yes, Update the Guidelines', ""No, Don't Update the Guidelines""]","[292221.4249375955, 0]",1

[YIP-80](https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/QmYa5RuQNAFqNq3DuBv1G24izWB9LomKZE3Pq2DvAeb7db) proposes a rebalancing of the treasury to manage risk. [YIP-81](https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/QmZjCqA5581cBrys7T2Du8CN2R1FoKJbRP4J9rs7jcGaWu) reconfigures the YAM DAO Set to remove SUSHI, UMA, and INDEX. In making these changes, we will also need to adjust how our treasury is allocated. In making the following recommendations, we will use the post on [Treasury Management Framework 3](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-treasury-management-framework/1511) as guidance.

## Action Items
After Rebalancing, move:
- ~$400,000 USD worth of ETH into uPUNKS.
- ~$1,000,000 USD worth of ETH into uGAS.
- ~$1,000,000 USDC into uSTONKS.
- ~$400,000 worth of ETH, and $400,000 worth of DPI into the Uniswap v2 pool.
- ~$80,0000 worth of ETH and $255,000 in USDC to our new fuse pools according to this [post](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-77-bootstrapping-yam-fuse-pools/1504/5?u=rossgalloway).
- ~$467,000 worth of DPI, ~560,000 USDC, and ~$840,000 ETH (some existing WBTC will be included in this number) to YDS.
- ~$10,000 worth of ETH and $100,000 USDC to the Multi-sig.
- The rest of the ETH and DPI will live in the general treasury (or other governance controlled wallets at the discretion of @flygoing.eth).
- Other assets (Index, UMA, xSushi, GTC, MUST) will stay where they are.
- Stablecoins held in the general treasury wallet will be converted to yDAI per [YIP-82](https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/QmRwUZdc4B7qP9Kfp7GtggRVunoydMVzqLaLkM6qc58ZXr).

Since then, Yearn has developed numerous other vault products and the yUSD vault no longer earns comparable returns to the newer, more robust and flexible products. 

As we rebalance the Treasury and YDS per YIPs 80, and 81, we have an opportunity to upgrade our yield bearing stable-coins to one of these newer products. yDAI is the most philosophically aligned with our mission as DAI is an un-censorable stablecoin backed by ETH and other assets.

Making this change should earn the DAO additional interest from our stablecoins, and although no rates are set in stone, the returns on yDAI should be consistently higher than yUSD due to how the vault is constructed.

## Basic Summary

Restructure the Yam DAO Set so that it does nor include our strategic assets.

## Abstract

I propose that we limit the assets within the Yam DAO Set to only those that can be easily re-balanced without worrying about strategic uses. This would change the current YDS make-up to only include ETH, Stables, DPI, and WBTC. The SUSHI, UMA, and INDEX included in the set now would be moved into the treasury proper with the rest of those tokens
Motivation

### Advantages:
- This simplifies the re-balancing process for the Treasury and moves the onus of rebalancing our strategic assets to the larger treasury management process. 
- It will be easier for anyone to buy this SET since we can use NAV issuance to allow buyers to enter with one asset.
- If YDS that does not contain the tokens of projects that we are working with, it will have a larger addressable market and could be marketed to DAOs as a simple diversified treasury management tool.

## Specifications

Remove the specified assets from the Yam DAO Set. This may entail selling to ETH to exit, and re-buying the assets for the treasury. Some assets may not need to be re-bought if YIP-80 passes, as they are already above our desired allocation percentages.

~ 2930 SUSHI - could be sold for USD if YIP-80 passes
~ 1552 UMA - moved to Treasury

    Beta (vs ETH): 0.7
    Correlation (vs ETH): 0.6
    Standard Deviation (vs ETH): 1

This is the ""medium"" level from the risk criteria developed by @Krugman and can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSCNRXqpIUTFS8AfHrdLJbNox2yRnvWV5EO4dySw3kuVlnwhq07X51Z-ZdUw393ReX1nszf4GXbGv1G/pub

The target allocations for our large groupings of assets will be:

    ETH - 34%
    USD - 33%
    DEFI (DPI + strategic assets) - 33%

At the same time, it will set limits on the percentage of the treasury that the treasury holds in strategic assets, based on utility and market conditions (mainly liquidity):

    Sushi - 6% (Currently ~9.3%)
    UMA - 5% (Currently ~2.7%)
    INDEX - 3% (Currently ~7%)
    Gitcoin - 1% (currently 0.6%)

Read the full Proposal and Discussion here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-80-yam-treasury-rebalancing/1512

In order to meet these criteria, the treasury will sell the following assets for stablecoins:

    13% (~$420,000) of the treasury's ETH
    16% (~$330,000) of the treasury's DPI
    59% (~$356,000) of the treasury's INDEX
    46% (~$384,000) of the treasury's Sushi

These sales will buy either USDC or DAI. We expect this to roughly double the amount of stable-coins in the treasury. If there is a large change in the market before the on-chain vote then these numbers may change slightly to meet the risk criteria  outlined above.

https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x744D16d200175d20E6D8e5f405AEfB4EB7A962d1/transactions

Abstract

This proposal would allocate 50,000 $YAM tokens to a general expense multi-sig. In order to alleviate usage of funds from the Treasury, the community has suggested to minimize the usage of funds from the treasury for expenses, and instead use the $YAM that has already been minted in the contributor vesting pool.

Motivation

We’ve started working with some community developers and other members and asked them for a trial period. This Yam for the general expense fund would be used to incentivize these trial periods and show a commitment from Yam to compensate contributions. While they are performing tasks (before we create a full/part time contributor compensation proposal for them) we need to have access to an operating budget without going through a full governance proposal process for small, and typically irregular payments.

We’ve also started the uGas logo contest and it has gotten a significant amount of submissions from the community. The general expense fund would also be responsible for paying contest winners for this contest and others like it.

The general expense fund would be responsible for:

Yam infrastructure expenses
New Contributor trials / on-boarding
Development / collaborative tools
Gas costs
Small misc expenses directly related to Yam
If it is possible to pay in $YAM, then it should be the first option.

All expenses will be documented and a transparency report will be available monthly.

Forum Post here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-79-remove-the-great-yam-wall/1502

**Basic Summary**
The Great YAM Wall is bad for long term holders and sacrifices the health of the treasury for the gain of those looking to sell their YAM. We should remove it. 

**Abstract**
I have written a long explanation of why the Great YAM wall is a ineffective and counterproductive mechanism here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/tear-down-the-great-yam-wall/1494

TL:DR
- The Great YAM Wall was designed around the rebasing mechanism for YAM, which is no longer active, and because of that the core principals of it are no longer valid.
- The ""value"" of YAM comes from the community and core contributors using the treasury to build products that return value via revenues to the DAO. The GYW reduces our ability to do this by using assets that are productive to buy assets which are not productive. (YAM is not ""productive"" for the treasury because it cannot sell it or use it to make money. By using it for expenses we are further depressing the price.)
- There is little evidence that it will make any difference to the price in the long run as those who were looking to sell anyway do so at the expense of the treasury. 
- Other one time buy back examples (sushi, dxDAO) have not been effective in impacting the price of the token at all.
- We can design a better mechanism that benefits long term YAM holders and aligns the incentives of the community and contributors.

**Motivation**
I believe in what we are building at YAM. I know the rest of the core team do to. We view what we are doing as a marathon and not a sprint, and we should structure our decisions around that viewpoint. While the YAM price is important in the long run, selling off the treasury to make a short term impact on the price is like running a sprint in the middle of a marathon. It is pointless at best and counterproductive at worst.

We removed the rebase mechanism to pave the way for a better YAM. We should do the same with the Great YAM Wall.

**Specifications**
There is no current in-code implementation for the Great Yam Wall now, so there is no active change that needs to be made.

## **Abstract**

Yam.Finance team and UMA team is asking for help in consolidating our $UNI votes and $INDEX votes to iyamfeddas.eth so that we can:

1. Assist Uniswap to divest their community treasury by utilizing KPI options.
    1. In order to do so we need to go through their governance process. Which require 3 different votes each with higher quorum requirements (25k / 50k / 40m). 
2. $INDEX tokens can be used to vote on Defi Pulse Index meta proposals which has a significant number of $UNI votes. 
3. Can also support future initiatives that might be mutually beneficial for Yam / UMA and partners.

Feddas is directly in charge of Yam Treasuries, a treasury management as a service by Yam. Yam Treasuries has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs. We’ve realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAO’s treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter.

Treasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.finance/) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106 1](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)

## **Motivation**

Governance is a very challenging issue in DAOs. DAO governance participation is usually very low on the list of priorities for most stakeholders. As a long term stakeholder of a project, its not that you don't care about the governing the protocol but it's usually two reasons that keep you from participation:

1. Lack of time to fully understand the proposals or even the time to read and follow.
2. Thinking that your participation doesn't really matter. 

Vote delegation helps solve these two issues and will directly help in building out the Yam and UMA ecosystem.

https://forum.yam.finance/t/product-rebrand-proposal/1453

As we all know the DAO is currently working on three core products:
Degenerative Finance Synthetics,
Umbrella protection,
DAO House treasury management.

Yam Finance is putting itself on the map as a DeFi powerhouse, a collective of incentivized participants united by the YAM token and a shared set of values.

Today we’re aiming to take that unifying force to the next level by bringing product branding inline with the YAM token we all love.

If the community agrees with this proposal products will be rebranded as:
Yam Synths
Yam Protection
Yam Treasury

With this milestone we will recenter all Yam DAO products, putting the YAM token at the heart of everything we do. The core message of the DAO will be strengthened, and all products will benefit from this renewed clarity.

$6,250/month worth of Yam (@$2.50/YAM) Streamed Over 3 Months

# Biography + Skills and Experience
I’m the Lead of Product at a seed-stage startup. I have over 7 years of experience designing and building products. I operate in the intersection of customer success, product marketing, technical architecture, and business intelligence; all of which are needed to build incredible products. I’ve led my team from a third-world country to a global scale with international partners and backers. My skills involve full stack development, product design, and marketing. These have helped me build, launch, and scale lots of fun products in the past, for myself (as side projects) and my team. I joined crypto at the peak of the last bull-run (bought the BTC top 😭) and since have gone down the rabbit hole, all the way to #DeFi.

# Value add to Yam Team
Yam operates like a decentralised version of the product studio I run. I’ve learned a lot of painful lessons from my experiences there and will be using that to help the team setup a more robust and efficient product development process. I will be sharing templates and resources we have developed in hopes of that. I also think I can greatly support Yam and it’s suite of products with awesome UX design, branding and marketing graphics.

# What I’ve done for Yam
Integrated new design-to-development handoff workflow
Degenerative V2 information architecture, wireframes, landing page and web app UI
Umbrella information architecture, wireframes and web app UI
3D illustrations and character design
Product strategy sessions
What I am planning to do for Yam
I’ll be designing and developing the frontend for Yam and it’s products (Degenerative V2, Umbrella, and more). And creating illustrations & animations for its numerous brand/marketing applications.

62,QmQF2iVJq93ub3FypXsLKckxRF2j81KGAfQGDSTj4YfMR8,YIP-62 Proposal: Treasury Providing Liquidity for Comethswap L2 $YAM/$MUST Pool on Polygon,"**Basic Summary**

Comethswap is an L2 DEX on Polygon (fka Matic) belonging to the blockchain game Cometh. Yam has been running a promotional campaign with Cometh to create unique Yam-themed spaceship NFTs for use within their game based on designs submitted by the Yam Community. There will be a total of four NFT Yam spaceships.

Shortly after the conclusion of the promotional event, Cometh will launch a $YAM/$MUST pool on their ComethSwap DEX and incentivize it with $MUST rewards. At the same time, the Yam fleet NFTs will become available on OpenSea or via Cometh. The estimated launch is around May 3rd, 2021.

**Abstract**

Yam and Cometh will do a token exchange where Yam will provide Cometh with $25K in $YAM tokens in exchange for $25K in $MUST tokens. Cometh will then pair an additional $25K in $MUST tokens with the $YAM it received to seed the initial liquidity for the $YAM/$MUST pool on ComethSwap. Yam will then supplement that liquidity with the $25K in $MUST tokens plus an additional $25K in $YAM tokens to bring the total pool value to $100K at the start of the incentivized liquidity mining event.

Cometh will incentivize the $YAM/$MUST pool with additional $MUST token rewards. Additionally, the proceeds of the Yam fleet spaceship NFT sales will be used by Cometh to market buy additional $YAM to add to the liquidity held in the pool.

Since Yam does not hold $YAM tokens in its treasury, we will need to use $yUSD to purchase $YAM off the market.

**Motivation**

This campaign has several benefits:

- ComethSwap will become the $YAM token’s first listing on an L2 DEX allowing for trading with minimal gas fees. This will serve as an experiment for future L2 listings.
- This will be Yam’s first “buy back” event and will serve as an experiment regarding future $YAM token buy backs for exchange listings in the future.
- The initial market purchase of $YAM for $yUSD may have a small positive spot price impact on the $YAM token.
- The use of the Yam fleet NFT sales revenue to purchase $YAM may create additional buying pressure on $YAM.
- Using the proceeds from the NFT sale to supply liquidity to the ComethSwap pool allows Yam to deepen the liquidity on the DEX without the need to mint additional $YAM (inflation) or the need to expend too much in treasury funds.
- This liquidity mining event will benefit $YAM token holders who chose to provide liquidity through earning $MUST rewards.
- This promotion will bring added visibility and positive brand awareness for Yam and its products.

**Specifications**

This proposal follows the best practices suggested by Cometh and used with other participating protocols.

1.  $50k yUSD in treasury will be sold into $ETH. If it benefits the trade, the 2.  $yUSD will be unwrapped into $USDC, and then the USDC will be sold for $ETH.
3.  The $50K ETH will be sold for $YAM through the Sushiswap liquidity pool.
4.  $25K YAM will be provided to Cometh for initial pool liquidity in exchange for $25K MUST.
5.  Yam will migrate the remaining $25K YAM and $25K MUST from the Ethereum L1 blockchain to the Polygon L2 blockchain.
6.  Yam will deposit the remaining $25K YAM / $25K MUST into the 7. 
 $YAM/$MUST liquidity pool on ComethSwap created earlier.

Total initial liquidity in the $YAM/$MUST pool will be $100K.

**Voting Choices**

1.  Yes, spend $50k yUSD from the Treasury to supply liquidity to the YAM/MUST pool on ComethSwap.
2.  No, don't spend $50k yUSD from the Treasury to supply liquidity to the YAM/MUST pool on ComethSwap.","['Yes', 'No']","[311441.92773291806, 16766.57374553126]",1

Just for April (working half time): 1340 YAM 🍠

#### Biography + Skills and Experience:

Defi obsessed power user with expert financial product knowledge and investment & portfolio management skill set across the complex financial product spectrum. Strong grasp of Defi ecosystem and UMA’s synthetic asset framework. Solid coding knowledge included. Managing digital asset portfolios and arbitrage strategies since 2016.

My last job (resigned last month) was in Portfolio Analytics within the Data Insight team at a FTSE100 London Asset Manager where I was tasked with enriching data for actionable insight in managing investments. Before this I was working at a boutique asset and wealth management firm as a Portfolio Analyst and Wealth Manager. I have also passed all levels of the CFA program (respected Masters equivalent investment analyst qualification), have a Post Grad in Financial Planning and a base degree in Investment Management.

#### What I’ve done for Yam in the last month:

* Designed yieldYam 👨‍🌾🍠 (in development)
  * Un-liquidatable and to be the highest UMA yielding product in the synthetic ecosystem using YAM (<3) as collateral.
  * Huge utility for Yam holders not only for high APYs but to be used for Yam holders to not sell their Yam but hedge it for bear market conditions.
* Built a telegram bot 🤖for Yammers to monitor their degenerative synth collateral
  * https://github.com/thevdm1/collateral_tracking
* Produced trading based marketing content
* DaoHouse 🏡 business development meetings (post Sushi) as technical support
  * Support on complex queries relating to investment management.

#### Value add to Yam Team:

I would like to bring a wealth of financial expertise to Yam & its product suite. My contributions will always be focused on generating revenue for Yam.💲This is what will help the Dao sustain itself through the brutal cyclical nature of crypto. And as such this proposal will focus on my revenue generating capabilities for Yam if I am to be signed on by the community. 🍠

#### What I am planning to do that is revenue generating for Yam (first 3 months focus):

* Further develop DaoHouse and potentially design the DaoHouse index product 🦉
  * At a 0.7% streaming fee per $10M in such an index product could generate $70k revenue p.a for Yam. Scalable product. Some work still needs to be done before the index project gets a green light
* Continue to optimise Degenerative synths for short term rev. generation 💰
  * My proposed change to our synth mechanics would change GCR from 3.24 to 1.29 (using uGasJun as example) substantially increasing our treasury farming rewards -> 60% (*benefit % declines at lower synth prices). And attract higher TVL because the product can become un-liquidatable, further increasing treasury rewards.
  * Excluding special rewards for June uGas, rewards at assumed 50% APR with our $450k ETH position, the change would have earned the treasury $12k more each month until expiry.
  * This mechanical redesign has the same effects on any risky synthetic asset.
* In depth treasury investment analysis, structuring and management 💼📊
  * Optimise treasury investment return using data driven insight for decision making. By potentially improving our treasury returns even just 2% p.a from analysis and optimisations could generate Yam an extra $140k p.a. (assuming treasury at $7M)
  * Develop a treasury wide asset management framework

#### What else I am planning to do for Yam:

* Technical lead under Feddas in DaoHouse business development 🛠️
  * Including wider support on anything relating to DaoHouse - good to support Feddas who is split between operations and DaoHouse.

The last few months that I have spent working part time for YAM have been great and I would love the opportunity to expand my role within the DAO.

### Biography

I am an architect (buildings) who has worked on projects of many different scales on both the design and construction sides of the industry.  And while this may seem like it is not relevant to the work of building a DAO, it has a number of parallels where I believe I can add unique value (See ""why"" below). I discovered crypto in 2017 and have been active within the DeFi space for about a year. I would consider myself highly versed in the workings of the Ethereum ecosystem, and while I am not a developer, I have a broad knowledge of many projects, with a particular interest in crypto-economics.

### Current Role

My current role in the DAO is a bit amorphous. As described in the initial [compensation plan](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-yam-contributor-manifesto-and-compensation-revised-12-1-2020/1005) my role focuses on “strategy” with specific roles being discord moderation, strategy discussion, and SubDAO token sales, with an expected time commitment of 10 hrs/wk.

In the time since that proposal I have done work for the DAO in a number of different areas:

* [Governance analysis](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-governance-process-analysis-and-questions/1113) and [proposed reforms](https://forum.yam.finance/t/proposed-updated-governance-process-v0-1/1141)
* Work on UMA synths and the YAM collateral and price identifier Umips
* Ideation and discussion around [Degenerative economics and potential token design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ofMqEbTzrrjc11H74GQjBz-iobMta0w1DmxT3R4j8yA/edit).
* Contributed to numerous conversations about overall DAO strategy as well as strategy around specific sub-projects
* Business development leads for DaoHouse
* Moderated both discord and the forums
* Developed a number of out-there ideas including [AYM: a Yam Built Stablecoin](https://forum.yam.finance/t/aym-a-yam-built-stablecoin-and-revenue-token/1121) as well as a long analysis of our [pre-rebase token](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Jxtn1vP-HTkBICop1LFOt5wR3ROpX8Xc-kc58ZZdkA/edit) model that I’m pretty sure no one read.

The time is ripe for me to part ways with my previous job working for an architecture firm and come jump into Crypto and DeFi full time. **Below, I want to lay out why I think I am a good fit to contribute in an expanded role at YAM and how I would do so.**

### Why?

As many have mentioned before, YAM is a great story of rags, riches, and a phoenix risen from the ashes. It is a community of diverse contributors and smart cookies. What we are building is hard to nail down. YAM isn’t one thing, but a loose collection of ideas and projects that are all housed under one umbrella. This is what I love about it. It is not limited by some mandate or assumption of what it should be, but by what we choose to make it.

Building YAM is a bit like designing and building a house. There are lots of different pieces that all have their own requirements but in the end need to work together to make a cohesive and well functioning whole. This is often called composability, and it is what I love about architecture and it is also what I love about YAM, and Defi in general. There are many different elements that all need to be understood so that they can then be fit together to become more than a sum of their parts. **I want to help YAM become more than the sum of its parts.**

### How?

So how can we do that? I realize that the aspirational stuff I wrote above only works if we can get the individual components working well. That is where I will start.

* Degenerative.finance: I would like to take a larger role and help steward our new synths forward. I do not have the financial chops of some of the gurus around like Jono (TheVDM1) and Theo but I have a good sense of how UMA works and would be interested in diving in more. I can help coordinate turning the financial ideas that we have into working synths and assist with the marketing and messaging of them.

* Umbrella: As we gear up to launch Umbrella there seem to be a number of outstanding questions regarding how we want to position it in the market as well as optimize it for the target audience we choose. I would like to take on the challenge of diving into the protocol and working with the developers to better understand the inner workings of it and help to determine how we can make it a successful product. This will require working alongside Theo and Bruce to create a product that is beautiful and functional.

* Yam Factory: This would take lower priority compared to the above 2 roles. The Yam Factory is still just an idea. It needs to be fleshed out with ideation and documentation about what it is and how it may function. If we are going to fund and incubate projects, we need to first be able to communicate to potential builders how we can do that. I would like to work on a framework and documentation around the YAM factory that lays out an MVP for it. Some work on this has been done and it will need to be dug up and considered based on what we have learned recently with Degenerative and Umbrella.

* Overall Strategy: As a small and flexible organization, it helps to be able to wear many hats. And while I may focus a majority of my time on Degenerative and Umbrella, it is still important to keep the whole picture in mind. As I mentioned above, I want to help YAM become more than the sum of its parts.
  * In that spirit, I plan to stay abreast of everything that is happening in the DAO and look for ways that we can create synergies within our products but also with other protocols.
  * I will use the connections that I have within the space to search for new opportunities for YAM.
  * Continue to think hard about YAM and SubDAO tokenomics.
  * Research new projects and opportunities, including layer 2 solutions for our products.
  * Jump in to help with whatever is needed when deadlines loom, and hopefully use some of my design skills to help out our talented design team when needed.
  * Continue to propose crazy ideas in the hope that one day one of them won’t be as crazy as it sounds.

## Biography + Skills and Experience
As a developer, it's important for me to invest my time in projects where I can learn something, whether it's from the people who support me in my work or from the work itself. Besides these aspects however, it was mainly the YAM Community who led to my decision to contribute to the YAM DAO.

I have been part of the YAM community since the YAM protocol launched back in August 2020. Many may remember that day and in particular the moment when the community first came together and made a conscious decision to take a risk to support the YAM protocol in its darkest hours. Those hours not only laid the foundation for the YAM DAO, but also the foundation for my application.

I am a software engineer with experience in web and mobile app development and am able to use Web3, Solidity, Graphql, React and Vue. I am also willing to quickly adapt to a new tech stack should it be required in the future for my work on YAM projects.

### Requested Compensation:
$4,800 worth of TWAP Yam Streamed Over 3 Month Period


### Biography + Skills and Experience:
I’m the Lead of Product at a seed-stage startup. I have over 7 years of experience designing and building products. I operate in the intersection of customer success, product marketing, technical architecture, and business intelligence; all of which are needed to build incredible products. I’ve led my team from a third-world country to a global scale with international partners and backers. My skills involve full stack development, product design, and marketing. These have helped me build, launch, and scale lots of fun products in the past, for myself (as side projects) and my team. I joined crypto at the peak of the last bull-run (bought the BTC top :sob:) and since have gone down the rabbit hole, all the way to #DeFi.


### Value add to Yam Team:
Yam operates like a decentralised version of the product studio I run. I’ve learned a lot of painful lessons from my experiences there and will be using that to help the team setup a more robust and efficient product development process. I will be sharing templates and resources we have developed in hopes of that. I also think I can greatly support Yam and it’s suite of products with awesome UX design, branding and marketing graphics.


### What I’ve done for Yam:
So far, I’ve consulted on Yam on a design-to-development handoff workflow that will greatly increase our development speed (fewer “wen launch?” questions anyone?), some of which we will be trialling for Degenerative finance. I’ve also been working with Bruce on a top-secret project to reward the Yam community. Hint? It rhymes with delectables. I’ve also been working on the information architecture and wireframes for the Degenerative v2 dapp, super excited about this!

Author: @feddas
Forum discussions: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-treasury-providing-liquidity-for-ustonks-and-additional-yam-rewards-for-ustonks-and-ugas/1378


# Basic Summary
Degnerative.Finance is about to list uSTONKs synthetic that tracks an index consisting of ten stocks that are most commented on r/wallstreetbets. uGAS-JUN21 is going to switch to a quarterly expiration to increase liquidity on a single synthetic. Both synthetics will launch on March 8th. 
This proposal 

* yUSD in the treasury (~$910,000) to mint uSTONKs synthetics tokens on degenerative.finance. Then provide liquidity in order to mine UMA tokens. 
* Provide an additional total of 50,000 $YAM tokens as rewards over 3 weeks after March 8th for Minters and LPers of uSTONKS and uGAS-JUN21 to promote an active and strong market. 
  * This will be a trial run for future liquidity mining rewards for synthetics on Degenerative.Finance.
  * $Yam rewards will be provided from the incentive mining pool that has been already setup for farming incentives. No additional YAMs will be minted beyond what has been allocated for the incentive pool. 

# Abstract

Yam will offer additional 5000 $Yam Tokens first week and 10,000 $Yam next two weeks for Minting + LPing uSTONKS. Same rewards will also apply to uGAS-JUN21. 
We will be using around $900k of the treasury to Mint and LP uSTONKS. Initially it will be high CR ~4.

Using the yUSD in the treasury for degenerative.finance has several benefits: 
* Minting uSTONKs and providing liquidity will support the ecosystem for degenerative.finance. The higher the liquidity the more the potential volume and usage for uSTONKs. 
* By providing liquidity, the treasury will receive UMA rewards. 
* Minting uSTONKs requires stablecoin USDC as collateral and LPing uSTONKs requires USDC to pair. Ultimately there is no price risk, only impermanent loss risk and liquidation risk. 

# Specifications
The plan for the uSTONKs mint+lp treasury proposal: 
1. $910k yUSD in treasury will be unwrapped into USDC. 
2. Deposit $600k USDC to mint $150k of uSTONKs at a CR of 4.
3. Pair uSTONKs with $150k of USDC and deposit on AMM 
4. Deposit remaining $150k USDC into our general expense multisig to add collateral to our minted position in case it gets low because the price of uSTONKs goes up too much. 
5. Purchase additional $10k uSTONKs to cover any possible IL
6. If CR hits 2 we will add $150k USDC from general expense multisig in order to protect position.  

The plan for additional $Yam rewards distribution. 
1. Rewards will start on March 8th as soon as contracts are available and up on Degenerative.Finance
2. Additional UMA Rewards and YAM rewards will be airdropped for minting and LPing either uSTONKS or uGASJUN21
3. UMA and YAM rewards will be distributed on the regular monthly rewards distribution which will be April 7th + 3 days on-chain proposal.

## Basic Summary
#### yamHOUSE purchase of Coinshares Gold and Cryptoassets Index CGI

yamHOUSE has been funded with yUSD and Krugman is running analysis on potentially the initial purchases of assets for yamHOUSE. This proposal allows Krugman to purchase CGI. CGI index while it seems simple and boring, it is a very big deal. Structured products like CGI with an emphasis on Growth with reduced volatility in traditional finance receives investments in the Billions. This will be an arrow in our quiver of tools to market DAO House to other communities. 

## Abstract
The CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index Lite Version (CGCI-LV) is an adaptation of the original EU Benchmark Regulated index launched by the CoinShares Group in 2020 (see here: https://coinshares.com/products-services/index-strategies 30) that only includes ERC-20 tokens in order to be compatible in a tokenized index smart contract.


Since the original CGCI is constructed using physical gold and 5 individual cryptoassets some re-engineering of the initial structure was required, whilst ensuring that the core theory and value proposition was preserved. The CGCI-LV therefore deploys the same theory but instead limits the index to 3 ERC-20 token constituents; a gold stablecoin and 2 cryptoassets.
For the gold basket, wrapped-DGLD (wDGLD) was chosen as the ERC-20 gold stablecoin. For the cryptoasset basket wrapped-bitcoin (wBTC) and wrapped-Ether (wETH) were selected based on being the largest and most established cryptoassets.


Academic research conducted in partnership with Imperial College London found that a pairing of gold and cryptoassets in a way that accounts for their risk contribution delivers a risk-adjusted return profile that is superior to holding gold or cryptoassets alone. The CGCI-LV is designed with the aim of providing diversified exposure to the alternative asset space in a way that yields a superior risk-return profile when compared to holding such assets in isolation while being orthogonal to traditional financial markets. Accordingly, the Index must:

* Be comprised of a small number of liquid, investable constituent assets
* Exhibit a relatively stable composition of asset weights that do not vary dramatically between rebalancing periods, leading to low turnover
* Utilise some means of principled risk control leading to lower volatility
* Be specified in a clear and unambiguous manner to facilitate validation and reproducibility
* Hold constituent assets on a long basis only
* Not make use of leverage.


## Motivation
Two noteworthy characteristics of the returns of non-stablecoin cryptoassets are their high volatility, which brings with it a high level of risk, and their high intraclass correlation, which limits the benefits that can be had by diversifying across multiple cryptoassets. Yet cryptoassets exhibit no correlation with gold, a highly-liquid yet scarce asset which has proved to function as a safe haven during crises affecting traditional financial systems.

Although volatility poses challenges in terms of increased uncertainty, there are also benefits to be had from its proper management through diversification and regular rebalancing (Bouchey et al., 2012, The Journal of Wealth Management. Volatility harvesting: Why does diversifying and rebalancing create portfolio growth?). This is exemplified by the so-called Shannon’s Demon approach in which two, ideally uncorrelated, assets – at least one of which is highly volatile – are periodically rebalanced to maintain an ideal target allocation. The resulting expected growth rate is greater than the arithmetic mean of the individual expected growth rates, while the variance of the returns is less than the mean of the individual variances (Poundstone, 2005. Fortune’s Formula.).

The CGCI-LV is intended to be a low-volatility index that utilises the concept of volatility harvesting through (a) forming a basket of cryptoassets and (b) combining it with gold using weighted-risk contribution as a rebalancing mechanism. By decreasing volatility levels, it seeks to yield superior risk-adjusted returns when compared to a number of alternative strategies, including holding cryptoassets or gold alone. Further, it presents a moderate turnover, which should translate into moderate operating costs.

## Size of opportunity
The CGCI has already gained a lot of demand and CoinShares is currently investigating opportunities to deploy the index as an investable benchmark in its passive products business. Additionally, it is anticipated that the CGCI-LV would likely be well received by the native crypto community and is expected to be picked up by CEXs to offer it to their users.

### Basic Summary
Previously Yam has approved a general expense fund of $5000 yUSD from the treasury: 
https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-create-a-general-expense-account-and-reimburse-hodldwon-for-v3-contract-deployment-contribution/1021
This proposal adds 30,000 $YAM from the contributor vesting pool and converts the fund into a 2 of 3 multi-sig for small and irregular payments that would be too onerous go through a full YAM Governance proposal and vetting process. It will still be used for small general expenses, but now also for bounties, on-boarding new contributors before voting on part or full time compensation, marketing campaign costs, etc.

### Abstract

This proposal would allocate 30,000 $YAM tokens to a general expense multi-sig. In order to alleviate usage of funds from the Treasury, the community has suggested to minimize the usage of funds from the treasury for expenses, and instead use the $YAM that has already been minted in the contributor vesting pool.
We will create a 2 of 3 multisig to review and payout any small or irregular expenditures from the general expense fund. I nominate 3 non-U.S. based long time contributors with vested interest in making sure that funds are appropriately spent: Hodldwon, 0xE and Ronin.

### Motivation
We’ve started working with some community developers and other members and asked them for a trial period. This Yam for the general expense fund would be used to incentivize these trial periods and show a commitment from Yam to compensate contributions. While they are performing tasks (before we create a full/part time contributor compensation proposal for them) we need to have access to an operating budget without going through a full governance proposal process for small, and typically irregular payments.
We’ve also started the uGas logo contest and it has gotten a significant amount of submissions from the community. The general expense fund would also be responsible for paying contest winners for this contest and others like it. 
The general expense fund would be responsible for: 
- Yam infrastructure expenses
- New Contributor trials / on-boarding
- Development / collaborative tools 
- Gas costs
- Small misc expenses directly related to Yam

If it is possible to pay in $YAM, then it should be the first option. 
All expenses will be documented and a transparency report will be available monthly. 
When funds are low in the account, a top-up request for additional funds will be made. 

### Specifications
Create 2 of 3 Gnosis Multisig wallet and as 3 non-U.S. based contributors as signers. Suggested Contributors are Hodldwon, 0xE and Ronin. 
Send 30,000 YAM from Contributor Vesting Pool and the $5000 yUSD from Yam Treasury from the previous approval to a multisig and for each disbursement, ensure audit log records include
1) Party paid
2) Payment reason

#### Forum discussions: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-xx-governance-process-update-snapshot-signalling-changes/1234
See this post for more in depth discussion of rationale: https://forum.yam.finance/t/proposed-updated-governance-process-v0-1/1141

#### This is a final snapshot vote to determine the YAM voting power that will be required to create future signalling and final snapshots.

#### Basic Summary
Update the parameters of the governance process to improve efficiency and fairness for all participants. The specific element changes the requirements for snapshot votes

#### Specifications

All YAM quantities noted below are in scaled YAM (what you see in your wallet, and not BoU)

The proposed change is to create two separate types of snapshot votes: Signalling and Final.

Signalling Votes are used to determine support for a proposal and to determine parameters for governance actions. We propose that these votes require 2,500 YAM to be created. There is no quorum requirement on these votes and they can take any form (yes/no, percentage, ranked choice, etc).

Final Votes are used to ratify a proposal using snapshot. They require 10,000 YAM to be created and must be in a YES/NO format. They have a minimum quorum requirement of 500,000 YAM voting “Yes” and will pass with >50% of the votes (same as on chain votes).

This will require some work within the snapshot system to implement, which I leave to devs to comment on feasibility. I have no reason to believe it is not possible, although tweaks may occur once ratified based on feedback from developers. If there are changes to the specifications based on this feedback the proposal will be brought back to be re-ratified.

#### Author: @Feddas
#### Forum discussions: https://forum.yam.finance/t/distrbution-of-uma-rewards-for-ugas-and-yam-treasury-liquidity-mining-proposal-and-liquidation-bot/1138
 
# Basic Summary
The community has already approved using the treasury to provide liquidity to uGas: https://snapshot.page/#/yam.eth/proposal/QmWcns71u1c34b6sM6oJy8WoMLYcwz4b16bknTGvFFXH4x
There are four additional decisions that need to be ratified on how best to use UMA rewards and treasury to support uGas and future synthetics.

### 1. UMA rewards availability for minting uGas and LPing vs only LPing
Yam team believes that rewards for Minting uGas and LPing will provide the highest liquidity for uGas and synths. 

### 2. Since uGas synths expire every month, liquidity needs to be managed to ensure trading of multiple months contracts. How should we allocate UMA rewards for specific month contracts?
Yam Team believes that a weighted split of rewards on any particular month is not necessary. All rewards will be distributed to all Mint and LPers on any uGas contract. 

### 3. Yam community has already voted and approved allocating ~$400k worth ETH from the treasury to support uGas by minting and LPing. Which month uGas should we allocate what portion of this liquidity to? 
Yam team believes it’s best that we allocate 100% of this liquidity to the next month’s contract and roll it over on the 7th of every month. ie. on Feb 7th we will be moving Yam’s liquidity to March uGas contract. By providing all the liquidity on one month, it allows Yam to better manage risks of liquidation. If in the future the market matures, we can consider changing this. 


### 4. Create and deploy a Yam Treasury supported uGas liquidation bot. 
Yam team believes that we should deploy a liquidation bot to protect, Yam’s position but also the community’s positions. 
 
# Abstract
uGas is the first synthetic Degenerative.Finance is launching with and creating the right balance of incentives and liquidity is important to build out the synthetic ecosystem because uGas is only the first of many synthetics. 

The UMA rewards are based on the total value of minted synthetics vs total value of minted uGas. UMA distributes 50,000 UMA per week across all synthetics. Yam will receive it’s portion based on that ratio. Yam will distribute the rewards as per our medium article 10% Yam Treasury 40% dApp mining (degenerative.finance which is also Yam) and 50% to end users. After discussing with the UMA team there are a few things that need to be discussed and determined. A few key points that UMA explained: 

uGas’s primary use case is hedging / speculation. Need to add liquidity to at minimum a month in advance contract. Ie. Jan 1st, we should add liquidity to Feb’s contract. Jan’s gas usage is already starting to be known, so it’s ability to hedge or speculate is reduced. The more uGas that is minted, the more UMA rewards Yam receives to distribute. 
 
 
# Motivation
Yam’s goal is to create as large as possible uGas market by increasing minting and LP. We can do this by controlling the distribution of UMA rewards across uGas contracts. There are two variables that Yam should determine: 
Do we reward mint + LP or just LP
Yam team recommends we mint + LP for now then we re-evaluate. 
Cons - Rewards based on total invested are approximately half due to the increased collateral requirement.
Pros - Mint + LP creates a neutral position in uGas, so there’s no uGas price risk but there is impermanent loss risk and liquidation risk. Encourages more minted uGas thus creating a healthier market.
Beginning, ending and weighting of UMA rewards for specific monthly contracts. 
Yam team recommends we weigh rewards 75%/25% for the next two months uGas contracts and roll those rewards forward on the 7th of every month. 
ie. Today is Jan 7th, rewards are moved to 75% Feb and 25% March until Feb 7th. 
Based on recommendations from UMA it is better to add liquidity to next month’s contract. 
How much of the treasury should we invest into each uGas contract to provide liquidity? Previously, we approved providing 50/50 liquidity to the future two months but because of liquidation concerns we need to re-evaluate. 
Yam team recommends that the treasury deploys 100% of liquidity on Feb contract and rolls the liquidity March contract on Feb 7th + 2.5 days governance. 
There is a risk of liquidation if uGas prices rise and or ETH prices fall. Since it requires 2.5 days to pass an emergency provision, risk of liquidation is possible. UMA noted that anyone can deposit additional collateral to our position at any time to reduce the risk of liquidation. If added, it can only be removed by owner of contract (Yam), so there needs to be a defined reimbursement process and or incentive program. 
Liquidation bots are necessary for security of the contract. Brock is currently funding and running a bot. This function should be transferred to the Yam and its treasury. 
 
 
# Risks
There is a chance of liquidation which we will mitigate by monitoring the position and creating a discord bot to alert everyone if there is a position that is close to liquidation. 
A primer on how liquidations, collateral ratios and pricing of uGas token. 
There are two collateralization ratios (CR): 
Global CR - This is the average collateralization ratio across all token sponsors of a synthetic token. When minting uGas, you must stay above this CR. 
Minimum CR – This is the ratio that if you drop below, your collateral could be liquidated to cover your minted assets. For uGas tokens this ratio is set at 1.25. 
To mint uGas tokens, you deposit ETH as collateral and it allows you to mint tokens up to the Global CR. For example if you deposit $10,000 worth of ETH and the GCR is 4, that means you can mint up to $10,000/4 = $2,500 worth of uGas tokens. In this example, if you minted 10 uGas tokens, if you return 10 uGas tokens, it will unlock all of your collateral no matter the price of the token at the time of return. 
Pricing of uGas tokens is derived from the 2hr Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of the highest liquidity AMM pool. TWAP makes it resistant against flash attacks as they only effect a single or a few blocks, then natural arbitrage should return the price back to normal. 
What’s the risk of liquidation? If we mint with a ratio of 3.5 and the minimum CR is 1.25. uGas 2-hour TWAP would have to increase by 156% or ETH decrease by 64% to be close to minimum CR, both of which are unlikely.

https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-multisig-guardian/1123/5

Basic Summary

The Guardian role in the Compound governance module allows for the veto-ing of proposals. This is a helpful mechanism to provide an additional layer of security for the protocol to prevent governance takeovers. While this threat was greatest in the early days of the protocol when delegation was low and a vote AGAINST a malicious proposal might not have been feasible, it is still a valuable security measure to have.

As such, I propose to transition the Guardian role to a 3/5 Multisig.

Motivation

Currently the Guardian is set to the YAM Deployer address, controlled by Brock. He has never had to use the Guardian, and in many ways its very existence acts as a deterrent, but it is an unnecessary single point of failure for the protocol and adds unnecessary risk to his person and the protocol.

Specifications

Create a multisig with the following signers, create new Governor with multisig as governor, update admin of Timelock to new Governor:

**Basic Summary**

Yam is about to launch Degenerative.Finance dApp based on the UMA platform, our first few synthetics are going to be uGas tokens. For more information visit our discord chat and links below.

This proposal would use the up to the currently non-utilized ETH in the treasury (~$220,000) to mint uGasFeb / uGasMar tokens on degenerative.finance. Then provide liquidity in order to mine UMA tokens via their developer mining program: https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-announces-developer-mining-6f6fe15d5604

**Abstract**

Degenerative.finance beta will launch on Dec 21st and part of the treasury’s goal is to support the Yam ecosystem which degenerative.finance is a part of. Assets in the treasury should be utilized to gain yield with risk according to our investment strategy. Using the ETH in the treasury for degenerative.finance has two benefits:

1. Minting uGas tokens and providing liquidity will support the ecosystem for degenerative.finance. The higher the liquidity the more the potential volume and usage for uGas.
2. By providing liquidity, the treasury will receive UMA rewards.

**Motivation**

Degenerative.finance’s uGas token is the first of a series of synthetics that Degenerative plans on rolling out to the public. I’ve included a guide on what uGas is below. Adding liquidity to the uGas tokens is important to support the infrastructure and it also gets UMA rewards.

What is uGAS?

* uGAS is a Synthetic Gas Futures Token.
* Each uGAS token is named after the month that it’ll expire at the end of (for example, the uGAS-JAN21 token will expire at 0:00 UTC, Feb 1st 2021.)
* Once the uGAS token expires, it will settle at the median gas price of all Ethereum transactions for the past 30 days.
* Each uGAS token represents 1,000,000 GAS, so if the median gas price over the 30 days before expiry was 70 Gwei, the uGAS token would be worth 0.07 ETH.

Wait, what’s a Synthetic?

* Synthetic tokens are collateral-backed tokens whose value changes depending on the tokens’ reference index.
* In the example above, our uGAS’s reference index is the 30 day median gas price.
* Synthetics are created by depositing collateral into a smart contract and minting tokens backed by that collateral.

If you have any questions about Synthetics, feel free to drop by Yam’s discord.

**Risks**

There is a chance of liquidation which we will mitigate by only minting enough tokens to have a collateral ratio of 3.5 or Global Collateral Ratio, whichever is higher.

A primer on how liquidations, collateral ratios and pricing of uGas token.

There are two collateralization ratios (CR):

1. Global CR - This is the average collateralization ratio across all token sponsors of a synthetic token. When minting uGas, you must stay above this CR.
2. Minimum CR – This is the ratio that if you drop below, your collateral could be liquidated to cover your minted assets. For uGas tokens this ratio is set at 1.25.

To mint uGas tokens, you deposit ETH as collateral and it allows you to mint tokens up to the Global CR. For example if you deposit $10,000 worth of ETH and the GCR is 4, that means you can mint up to $10,000/4 = $2,500 worth of uGas tokens. In this example, if you minted 10 uGas tokens, if you return 10 uGas tokens, it will unlock all of your collateral no matter the price of the token at the time of return.

Pricing of uGas tokens is derived from the 2hr Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of the highest liquidity AMM pool. TWAP makes it resistant against flash attacks as they only effect a single or a few blocks, then natural arbitrage should return the price back to normal.

What’s the risk of liquidation? If we mint with a ratio of 3.5 and the minimum CR is 1.25. uGas 2-hour TWAP would have to increase by 156% or ETH decrease by 64% to be close to minimum CR, both of which are unlikely.

**Specifications**

To implement this proposal:

1. Create smart contract to use ETH currently in the treasury to deposit as collateral. Allocation as follows:

*  ETH split 50/50 for uGasFeb adn uGasMar.
*  Take 75% of the ETH to use a collateral and 25% to pair with uGas token to LP

2. Mint uGas tokens.
3. Deposit uGas and ETH as a liquidity provider on Uniswap to mine UMA.

=== In the Beginning ===

https://medium.com/yam-finance/yam-finance-d0ad577250c7

We’ve come a long way since the launch of Yam back on August 11th. As we move forward and learn from past choices, some fascinating dichotomies of programmable money and the people that govern them arise; the features of Yam are incompatible.

=== Motivation ===

Yam seeks price stability by changing the supply of Yams in your wallet without trying to adjust the value in your wallet, but that hasn’t worked very well. The price moves in the direction of the peg, but the problem comes when the community, who govern the protocol, seek price appreciation and not stability.

Token holders want appreciation of Yam:

How do these two things all fit together? Well, they don’t…

There needs to be a positive feedback loop between community governance, the YAM governance token, and value creation by Yam Treasury investments, and by all accounts the rebasing mechanism is holding us back.

We are currently developing multiple products in tandem including Umbrella, UMA-Degenerative, and YAM DAO Set (YDS). All of which have some component of revenue generation. We are also installing the machinery for our Yam Factory to hopefully create even more products. I would like the Yam community to focus on what we are building and not the rebasing function.

Here are the Pros of a rebasing asset:

It can be gamified (largely due to artificial price movements and supply changes)
It’s an interesting experiment that could lead to unique use cases that non-rebasing assets cannot do.
Stable-ish (in theory)

Here are the Cons of a rebasing asset:
More complicated to understand and calculate profit/loss than a non-rebasing asset.
Composability between other protocols like AMMs need to be whitelisted otherwise YAMs staked as a liquidity provider could be lost.
Any centralized exchange needs to constantly update account balances according to the changes in supply.
Stable-ish
high gas fees for calling the rebase function an syncing whitelisted pools for the balance updates (high $100’s to low $1,000’s per month just in gas fees)

Composability is important for long term sustainability. We are already finding new collaborations with other DeFi protocols and we don’t plan on stopping there. Potentially some of these collaborations will be hindered by a rebasing asset.

== Specifications ==

Developer light to implement. The scaling factor would be fixed at a specified time and the rebase function deactivated by calling this function:

See Forum Discussion https://forum.yam.finance/t/rfc-replace-yam-rebase-mechanism/1058

Instead of the rebasing mechanism, there are other ways to raise funds for the Treasury. We propose a simple 3% yearly inflation of Yams fed into the Treasury for future strategic investments.

Possible uses of the Yam to directly support the Yam ecosystem:

- Add additional distributions as farming incentives currently allocated to Yam/ETH Sushiswap pool.
- Buy ETH to pair with Yam to provide liquidity on the Yam/ETH Sushiswap pool and farm Sushi.

How does this help you as a token holder?
Easier to understand than rebasing and treasury purchases and provides less barriers to enter for new investors. They are able to understand the purpose of their investment and the goals of Yam.

Additional liquidity allows for larger purchasers to enter and exit.
Allows the treasury to continue to grow via Sushi farming.

=== Basic Summary/Abstract ===

https://forum.yam.finance/t/force-yamv2-mitigation-to-yamv3-to-keep-community-consensus-united/772

My proposal has positive poll. I try again.
YAMv2 and YAMv3 are separated from each other, they are confusing. People buy V2 by mistake and lose money. This is not good for Yam. It is better we stop V2 and only focus V3.

This proposal is to bring users YAMv2 into YAMv3 so we have consensus. Consensus is important for future of Yam. We give Yamv2 time and let everyone know that we want to bring V2 into V3.

=== Motivation ===
Make Yam Community Consensus United Again!

=== Risks ===
The very little risk for yam community, the benefit is we could keep the YAM consensus a ONE, not two.

=== Specifications ===
YAMv2 to mitigate to YAMv3, team should specify a final date.

## Biography, Skills and Experience

BS in Systems Engineering with minor in Finance.

Worked in Wealth Management for ~10 years. Received my securities license. Expert knowledge in risk management, mutual funds, insurance, mortgages and sales. 

After wealth management, I built and ran restaurants. Two restaurants were built from ground up, including design, construction, hiring, marketing, guest relations, accounting and all internet systems. One is a quick service restaurant 4-stars on yelp and opening a second location in 2021. I am the primary shareholder and my partner runs the operations. The other one is a full-service restaurant 4.7 stars on opentable.com. Expert knowledge in operations management from top down. Managed a team of 60 employees. 

My alternative life has been in crypto since 2015. Crypto is my passion. I believe in the future of it, I eat sleep dream crypto. Created multiple crypto related products and services, from a hedge fund to physical secure crypto gift cards. Been searching for an opportunity to join a project/team like Yam. This is where my passion lies.

## Value add to Yam Team
Experience in finance, business and crypto puts me in a unique position to be operations role to create an organized framework and to fully utilize resources to achieve Yam’s mission. My goal is to create enough infrastructure so that Yam as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization can become an Autonomous that can achieve its mission. 

## What I’ve done for Yam
I started with Yam since V1, assisted in the voting to save yam but didn’t start contributing until V3. With my wealth management background I saw the proposal to buy $250k DPI without any thoughts to overall treasury management. To me as a token holder at that time, I was worried that without an overall portfolio plan with risk management, the treasury would be in trouble for the long term, so I volunteered. Following the guidance of the Yam team and the Yamifesto, here is a list of things that I’ve directly worked on and wrote about on the forum.
1. Formalize Yam Treasury % Allocation for Yam Ecosystem Development (including developer pay) / Investment Strategy
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/formalize-yam-treasury-allocation-for-yam-ecosystem-development-including-developer-pay-vs-investment-strategy/742
	b. This started the discussion of portfolio management and a better way to manage the treasury. 
2. Formalize a treasury investing strategy and allocation.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/formalize-a-treasury-investing-strategy-and-allocation/703
	b. Led to this discussion of investment strategy for the investment side of the treasury. 
3. YIP Proposal: Treasury investment strategy and allocation – Updated.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-and-allocation-updated/831
	b. Listen respond and improve idea but continually push forward. 
	c. I think this is when I was invited to be a “strategist”, before this point I was only a community member trying to help out. 
4. YIP Proposal: Treasury investment strategy and allocation - Updated 10/16.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-and-allocation-updated-10-16/853
	b. Listening and learning what limitations and how to go about working inside the Yam ecosystem. It is easy for you or I to buy a cryptocurrency and stake/farm but doing it using a DAO with on-chain governance voting is significantly different. 
5. YIP Proposal: Treasury Investment Strategy - DPI / ETH Indexcoop Farming.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-dpi-eth-indexcoop-farming/873/2
	b. Applying discussions from community and investment strategy from above proposals, I push forward the idea of farming Index.
6. YAM Investment Portfolio - Description and Current Road Map.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-description-and-current-road-map/906
	b. A conversation on between me and another member on discord sparked the idea of a collaboration between Tokensets and Yam which eventually turned into YDS – Yam Dao Set. 
	c. Fortunately one of our strategists is @Krugman which is #2 in Assets Under Management on Tokensets currently. Krugman was able to formalize this relationship. 
	d. I continued to update the community on current progress via discord chats and forum posts. 
7. YAM Investment Portfolio Update #1 – Voting for Investment Strategy.
a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-investment-portfolio-strategy-polling-voting/927
	b. Krugman is an expert at technical analysis for risk management. He designed a system to manage the risk of the portfolio in YDS – Yam Dao Set. 
	c. Proposal helps the community decide on the level or risk / return that we want for the investment arm. 
8. YIP: Create a Contributor Manager Position.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-create-a-contributor-manager-position/947
	b. As I was going through the process of YDS I noticed a few things that needed more structure in Yam. 
		i. We had super talented contributors that have stuck around and volunteer their time because they believed in Yam. When they could they help tremendously but ultimately their time was tied up in things that they needed to do to create income. 
		ii. There was no structure to coordinate the efforts of contributors. Without coordination of efforts, a lot of value is wasted. 
		iii. I proposed that Trent take up the efforts and be a manager of current and future contributors. 
		iv. In addition, someone needs to manage a budget for paying contributors. Volunteers can only last so long without pay.
9. YAM Investment Portfolio Update #2.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-update-2/948/1
	b. Update to YDS as we communicate with the set team and find out how to collaborate so it is mutually beneficial. 
	c. I nominate Krugman to manage the set because of his past experiences. I believe he will make us money. 
	d. We also start plans to offer this as a product to other organizations. We are building a unique product that will be very beneficial for other DAOs. Once we get YDS setup, it will be very easy to market this product/service and generate revenues for Yam treasury. 
10. Modelling of Size and Effectiveness of The Great Yam Wall.
	a. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-size-and-effectiveness-of-the-great-yam-wall/959
	b. Ragequit was one of the reasons why I invested into Yam but because of a few issues it was side tracked. 
	c. TotV3 and I designed the new ragequit protocol that will use the treasury to directly support the price of Yams if it goes down too much. 
	d. This post models the potential value that can be achieved out of a small portion of the treasury. 
	e. If we are to use treasury funds we should be aware of the potential impact of those funds. 

TL/DR:
I’ve directly worked on a number of proposals to build the Yam ecosystem. Every proposal was unprompted, I noticed a need and started the proposals then adjusted as I learned, discussed and understood. My efforts directly with purchasing ETH and Farming Index (DPI was not my initiative) have already generated $10ks+ in revenue. YDS I know will generate even more revenue for Yam. Ragequit was a community initiative but never finished, and I intend to finish it. 

Aside from proposals, everything that I do I create a framework and discuss with the team. I’ve opened the lines of communication to the Chinese community. These frameworks are a critical component in creating an autonomous organization. “Give a person a fish and it will feed him for one day, teach a person how to fish and it will feed him forever,” this is my motto in building Yam. In order for Yam to be autonomous there needs to be clear guidance for every step of the organization. Creating a framework in the beginning of the organization before it grows to big is key to growth and sustainability. I’ve learned this lesson multiple times owning and running my own organizations.

**TLDR:**
All part-time contributors have been critical in multiple aspects of developing and building Yam. They were never promised compensation but they volunteered for several month because they believed in Yam’s mission: 
 
Yam is a community run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance, bound by shared financial incentives with the goal of empowering people with greater economic benefits and financial well being within the emerging world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
 
As we progress through the building of Yam’s ecosystem, time requirements and dedication is necessary to build out the current and future products. 
 
### Here are the guidelines for part-time contributors to receive compensation: 
•	Each contributor has their roles and responsibilities. 
•	Part-time commitment is ~10hrs of documentable work a week. 
•	Monthly contributor reports. 
•	Quarterly reviews. 
•	Weekly discussions and or calls
•	Contributors will control their own time, if there are any issues with the weekly requirements, they are flexible. 
 
### Contributor Core Values
•	Open and Merit Based Discussion: Contributors should organize information to be presented to the community in an open and unbiased manner.

[Yam Mission Statement Ratification](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-yam-mission-statement-ratification/1009)
# Basic Summary
This proposal is to vote on the Yam’s Mission Statement.
# Abstract
The Mission Statement is the culmination of a four-part brand definition process as documented in previous forum posts. Please review and vote on the mission statement. If you vote “No”, please provide a comment. Yam’s mission statement summarizes the purpose that drives the Yam DAO community. It says why Yam does what it does. When Yam considers new opportunities, it relies on the mission to make appropriate decisions.
# Motivation
Brands are tools that drive value: it was this premise that motivated Yam contributors to invest time developing the Yam brand. Branding is a long-term strategy that can yield measurable returns throughout the life of Yam as it grows and morphs.
### Here are Three reasons to invest time and energy developing the Yam brand.
#### 1. Attract Customers, Yam Members, and Ecosystem Partners
By clearly defining audience personas and crafting marketing messaging that’s specifically targeted at your ideal target audiences. Significantly improve relationships with those that interact with Yam’s brand. And few things are more valuable than brand loyalty.
#### 2. Boost Value of Organization
Never underestimate the power of brand equity. it can have a positive effect on your YAM token price. Stronger brands realize stronger financial performance. The long-term result of branding is that the Yam DAO itself is worth more.
#### 3. Increase Marketing Effectiveness
When your brand is cohesive and well-articulated, your marketing initiatives will be too. Branding encompasses the essential “first steps” that define Yam’s core messaging, brand personality, and marketplace position. A set of guidelines and templates that come out of branding will save Yam time, money, and frustration when developing future initiatives.
# Specifications
At the core of the Yam brand is the mission statement which is presented below in both a short-form and a long-form.
# Yam’s Mission Statement - short-form
Yam is a collaborative community innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance. Our open, fair and ethical philosophy fosters an inclusive and energetic culture. We are a fair-launch DAO pushing the bounds of innovation and launching experiments to enable the very promise of what DeFi can become for the world: a global, permissionless financial ecosystem.
________________________________________
# Yam’s Mission Statement - Long-form
Yam is a community run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance, bound by shared financial incentives with the goal of empowering people with greater economic benefits and financial well being within the emerging world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Yam mission and vision is supported via three guiding pillars.
#### Fair and Ethical Distribution
By the community, for the community. We are an ultra-committed community of doers embracing an open, fair and ethical philosophy. The Yam community fosters an inclusive, energetic and collaborative culture committed to building valuable products and infrastructure that benefit the Yam community.
#### Decentralized On-Chain Governance and Treasury
Yam is committed to decentralized protocol ownership, leveraging its powerful and forward-looking community to both build and guide the protocol forward. The community decides together how best to invest the treasury and grow the protocol which can only be performed with approval from YAM holders’ on-chain votes.
#### Innovation: Unique economics with cutting edge experimentation
Yam seeks to enable the very promise of what DeFi can become for the world: a global, permissionless financial ecosystem. Think of Yam as an idea factory dedicated to creating new innovations and launching experiments. Yam is therefore in uncharted waters, full of unknowns and possibilities, and we like it here. In the midst of these unknowns and possibilities, Yam’s mission serves as its north star.
#### How Yam is different
While other DeFi ecosystem players subscribe to similar goals, many make various trade-offs for efficiency, security, or profit in place of decentralization and community ownership. These tradeoffs can sometimes be rationalized, but Yam will refuse to stray from our core values, and instead drive confidently forward together with our community.

# Basic Summary
#### Hi Yam Fam, I @Krugman am applying as Yam Dao Set Portfolio Manager
# Abstract
#### Operations Manager Role and Responsibilities (Part-Time Position) 
•	Yam Dao Set portfolio management - responsible for building and maintaining smart contracts and UI for YDS.
•	Portfolio risk management and rebalancing based on governance set guardrails. 
•	YDS Product and partnership development

#### Requested Pay: $2,500 USD and 416.67 Yam/mo (1 Year Vesting BoU Yam)
#### Biography + Skills and Experience:
Krugman is a full stack software developer by profession.  He has spent the last decade as a retail trader and has experience with Forex, futures, options, options on futures, equities and crypto.  He entered the crypto space in 2019 and joined TokenSets as a premiere trader.  He quickly rose to the top of the leaderboards in total buyers, AUM and performance.  He regularly participates in governance across multiple DeFi protocols.
•	Working with TokenSets to build out the functional and technical requirements noted above.
•	He will be directly involved in building the smart contracts needed.
•	Was a launch-day social trader on tokensets and is ranked #2 by total AUM. 
•	Trading since 2013 with experience in cryptocurrency, FX, futures, options and equities. 
•	Been a core contributor with Yam since the beginning. 

#### A word from Aaron:  
I am honored to be nominated and considered for the position of Yam Dao Set Portfolio manager.  Ever since entering the DeFi space in 2019 I have become very passionate about centralized finance.  That journey began with me registering as a social trader on TokenSets in early 2020 and developing some of the largest AUM and highest yielding social sets to date.  This journey has culminated in me becoming a major advocate of DeFi where I often write detailed technical write-ups of various DeFi topics and have even been inspired to start a YouTube channel where I plan on creating a hub of video tutorials to help onboard the next generation of decentralized finance users.

While I have felt drawn to many things (teaching, writing articles, videos, etc.) my strongest passions have always been with software development and financial markets.  That fact is clear over my decade plus experience as both a full stack software developer as well as a trader and student of global markets.  This position as the Yam Dao Set Portfolio Manager gives me an opportunity to use those passions and skills to help further the goals of the Yam dao and wider Yam community.  I believe that the future of Yam is very bright and this community has much to look forward to in the years ahead.

Thank you for considering me for this position and the responsibilities and duties it entails.

•	Yam infrastructure expenses
•	Development / collaborative tools
•	Gas costs
•	Small misc expenses directly related to Yam
•	Minor marketing/contest rewards for community members.

In addition, A reimbursement to HodlDwon for 15ETH that he paid for Yam V3 Smart Contract deployment on Sept 17. Gas costs were extremely expensive at that time. Thank you @hodldwon for contributing to this.

After YDS is ready and tested, we will move the assets and let the Portfolio manager reallocate funds as needed. 

General consensus from the community found that a moderate 3 was appropriate for our initial strategy:
A majority of the treasury is held in a yielding stable coin yUSD, I would like to diversify more of the yUSD into wBTC and ETH to approach our target of moderate 3 aggressiveness which would target a Beta (vs. ETH) of 1.5 and a correlation of 0.8. Since the Beta underlying target is ETH, this creates a fairly aggressive portfolio, which will contain a good amount of volatility. This is balanced by the fact that we only invest a minority portion of the entire treasury into YDS.

@Feddas
@ToTV3

Basic Summary
A core value proposition for YAM has always been the unique value of our growing treasury model. A ragequit function has been a goal of the community as a way to create a price floor from the beginning. Full implementation of ragequit will not work as it was originally envisioned primarily because capital inside the treasury will be utilized to grow and develop the Yam ecosystem. This proposal is an alternative to initial ragequit designs and would allocate n% of the value of the treasury for use in executing buybacks if Yam Market Cap < Yam Treasury Value.

Abstract
A function will be created that is callable by anyone. Function will only be available when Yam Market Cap < Yam Treasury Value. Yam Treasury Value will not include any new Yam product tokens until they are voted on to be added to this function. When called, the function calculates the necessary size of purchase to increase Yam Market Cap => Yam Treasury Value. Funds for use in this function will be earmarked and set aside by this proposal. This will effectively create a price floor for Yam as originally proposed by ragequit by providing a strong defense for YAM as price is falling or as Treasury value rises.

When the function is called:
If market cap is above book value there is no action
If market cap is below book value the necessary purchase as calculated by the function will be executed on the highest liquidity YAM pair.
YAM procured by this function will be used in the most productive way possible determined by the community. This might be burning, selling, using for incentives, providing liquidity, lending, etc.

The value of funds allocated to this function should increase as the treasury grows up to a maximum cap. Options for achieving this will be determined by the developers to be a simple and easy as possible.

Specifications
Vote to determine whether or not we should move forward with this iteration of ""ragequit"". Future snapshots will determine the pool amount and potential ways to use any Yams bought using this function for the benefit of the community. 

Chinese Translation
基本总结
YAM的核心价值主张一直是我们不断发展的资金模型的独特价值。无处不在的功能已成为社区的目标，从一开始便是建立价格底限的一种方法。完全实施ragequit不会像最初设想的那样奏效，这主要是因为国库内部的资金将用于发展和发展Yam生态系统。该提议是初始暂定项目的替代方案，如果Yam市值<Yam国债价值，则将n％的国库券价值分配用于执行回购。

抽象
将创建一个任何人都可以调用的函数。仅当薯类市场市值<薯类国库券价值时，该功能才可用。 Yam Treasury Value将不包含任何新的Yam产品令牌，除非将其投票通过添加到此功能。调用该函数时，将计算必要的购买量以增加Yam市值=> Yam国债价值。该提案将预留专用于此功能的资金，并予以预留。当价格下跌或国债价格上涨时，这将为Yam 提出一个强有力的辩护，从而有效地为Yam 提出价格底线。

调用函数时：
如果市值高于账面价值，则不会采取任何措施
如果市值低于账面价值，则将根据流动性最高的YAM对执行该函数计算出的必要购买。
通过此功能采购的YAM将以社区确定的最有效的方式使用。这可能是燃烧，出售，用于激励，提供流动性，贷款等。

随着国库增加到最高限额，分配给该职能的资金价值应增加。开发人员将确定实现此目标的选项，使其尽可能简单易行。

技术指标
投票决定我们是否应该继续进行“ ragequit”迭代。将来的快照将确定池数量以及使用通过此功能购买的任何Yams的潜在方式，以使社区受益。","['Yes proceed with building the ""Great Yam Wall""', 'Do not proceed. ']","[98639.36725495684, 0]",1

Encourage YAM price appreciation by temporarily restricting the supply of YAM during the v3 relaunch.

Summary

YAMv2 that is deposited in the YAMv3 migration contract will become available to withdraw and use according to the following schedule:

- 50% available immediately upon v3 launch;
- 50% to become available (vest) continuously over the first 30 days after v3 launch.

YAM paid out to liquidity providers in Uniswap pools will be available to withdraw and use according to the following schedule:

- 50% available immediately when the incentive is claimed;
- 50% to become available (vest) continuously over 90 days after the incentive is claimed

YAM that is awarded to addresses that delegated votes in the attempt to save YAMv1 will be available to withdraw and use according to the following schedule:

- 100% to become available (vest) continuously over the first 90 days after v3 launch.

Rationale

It is desirable to head into the initial YAMv3 rebases with a price in significant excess of the target price of $1.00. This will help build excitement for the return of YAM and to seed the YAM treasury to fund the purchase of assets and future experiments to expand YAM.

When v3 launches, there will be users who do not yet own YAM who want to purchase YAM to take part in the experiment. This demand to purchase YAM will put upward pressure on the price. By restricting the amount of YAM initially available to buy on the market through the vesting recommended in this proposal, this may improve the price heading into the initial rebases.

Vesting of tokens, including vesting of YAM awarded to addresses that delegates voted in the attempt to save YAMv1 and YAM awarded to liquidity providers, will also help to align incentives and to encourage longer-term engagement with all users of the YAM platform.","['For Vesting Schedule', 'Against']","[250119.6564626119, 3209.205786542279]",1
117,QmcHG5AFKrSXJ7bnww8rJfTSUPYtK3tbVXBVr4oxzKoEqY,YIP-17: YAM FAM Improved LP Incentives,"Objective

Incentivize YAM liquidity providers over a longer time period while avoiding overpaying for liquidity—and creating unnecessary downward pressure on the YAM price—in the first few weeks after launch.

Summary

YAM payments to incentivize liquidity providers in the YAM:yUSD Uniswap pool will be distributed according to the following schedule:

- 92,538.3 YAM to be paid to liquidity providers in the first week;
- The amount of the incentive to decrease by 10% in each subsequent week.

If this payment continues indefinitely, the total incentive paid to YAM:yUSD liquidity providers overall will be 925,383 YAM. This is the same LP incentive total as proposed in the YIP-15 amendment.

Rationale

YAM is a long-term experiment, and YAM incentives should be designed to support the goals of the YAM platform over the long term.

The liquidity provider incentives proposed in the YIP-15 amendment start far too high, distributing 30% of the LP incentive pool—almost 10% of the current YAM supply—in only the first week! This dilutes current YAM holders, overpays for liquidity, and puts unnecessary downward pressure on the YAM price.

By stretching the liquidity provider incentives over a longer period of time, liquidity can be incentivized over a longer time period and unnecessary downward pressure on the YAM price can be avoided.","['For Improved Incentives', 'Against']","[252968.84160598987, 174.64477997673217]",1
118,Qma5N6xV4nkzBALgGZMSD8L7A7mrsrRMntXpx2xT1MGPbu,YIP-23: YAM FAM Migration Rescue Airdrop,"Objective

Airdrop funds to assist users who missed the YAMv1 → YAMv2 migration except for dust accounts, accounts with YAMs only in Uniswap, and unharvested yield accrued to LPs but never claimed.

Summary

Using a snapshot of YAM V1 balances at the last possible block of migration, airdrop YAM V3 according to the following rules:

- Account has more than a “dust” amount of YAM V1, where ‘dust’ will be defined based on gas costs at the time of the airdrop;
- The YAM V1 is not in a burn address;
- The YAM V1 is not in the Uniswap Pool;
- The YAM V1 was harvested to the user wallet and not left “unclaimed”

Stated clearly, accounts that purchased YAM after the migration block will not be compensated. And accounts that failed migration because they were providing liquidity in Uniswap will also not be compensated. Only YAMs claimed (harvested) to the user’s wallet will be valid, unclaimed yields will not be compensated.

Records of all compensation transactions will be published for inspection by the YAM community.

This is an alternative to “YAM FAM Migration Rescue Multi-sig Fund” and if both pass, would be enacted only if it receives more “approve” votes than the “YAM FAM Migration Rescue Multi-sig Fund” proposal.

Rationale

Around 1.5% of the YAM supply—approximately 75,000 YAM—missed the YAMv1 to YAMv2 migration. The migration window was a rather short 72 hours, and some users did not hear the announcement, could not reach their wallet in time to migrate, or encountered technical difficulties with the migration transactions that prevented migration from succeeding.

By airdropping this small amount of funds to assist these users, the YAM project can demonstrate its commitment to early supporters and invite them to re-engage with the YAM project.","['For Rescue Airdrop', 'Against']","[22200.768991539473, 35110.03188096424]",0

Set aside funds to assist users who missed the YAMv1 → YAMv2 migration except for dust accounts, accounts with YAMs only in Uniswap, and unharvested yield accrued to LPs but never claimed.

Summary

Allocate funds to compensate users who missed or failed to migrate from YAMv1 to YAMv2 according to the following schedule:

- Set aside up to 50,000 YAM (1% of the 5,000,000 YAM total supply), but start with only 10,000 YAM in a 3-of-5 multisignature wallet managed by active YAM community members (Members TBD);
- If the initial 10,000 YAMs is disbursed to claimants, YAM Governance would vote to mint another batch of 10,000 YAM for disbursement by the multisignature wallet;
- Advertise the availability of assistance to users who missed the YAMv1 migration;
- Disburse funds to compensate users that failed to migrate with 100% of the equivalent number of YAMv3 that they would have received had they successfully migrated to YAMv2;
- Six weeks after the launch of YAMv3, any unclaimed funds set aside are to be sent to the YAM treasury.
- Some migration failures were already compensated by YAM community members. These community members would have blockchain records examined, and would be reimbursed for their proactive efforts to compensate for failed migrations.

Compensation requests will be compared to a snapshot of balances on the last possible block of migration, excluding those accounts in the Uniswap pool and reimbursed from the multisig on a case-by-case basis. Stated clearly, accounts that purchased YAM after the migration block will not be compensated. Accounts that failed migration because they were providing liquidity in Uniswap will also not be compensated. Only YAMs claimed or harvested to the user’s wallet will be valid, unclaimed yields will not be compensated.

Records of all compensation transactions will be published for inspection by the YAM community.

Item 1:

We propose to update the conclusion of the V2 interim governance period to 11:59PM UTC, August 31, 2020. All valid proposals and amendments passing with quorum at that time and not superseded by a conflicting proposal will be implemented in V3.

This timeline ensures all currently valid proposals will have time to conclude, with the exception of the proposal to create a more formal YIP process. While this idea is valuable, the governance process will necessarily change with the fully functional V3 protocol, and a proposal framework can be developed through community dialogue without a V2 vote. 

Item 2:

We propose the following audit details:

Auditor: Peckshield Inc.
Cost: $28,000
Length: 3.5 person-weeks
Rate: $8,000/person-week
Start Date: Week of 8/31/2020
Completion: Approximately two weeks after start

This option was chosen based on auditor availability, as well as the fact that Peckshield is already familiar with the codebase due to their work on V1 to V2 migration.

Item 3:

We propose the remaining funds from the Gitcoin audit grant will be used to fund future audits and a bug bounty program to be instituted at launch, at the launch team’s discretion.

There are three steps to go.

1. Short-term: YAM wallet issues a new tokens named Yamily(Yamy), partly used for airdrops to YAMv2 moved to YAMv3 holders, which can increase members’ centripetal force to the community and stimulates the price raising of YAMv3; partial tokens are used for private and crowd sale, It can greatly increase the financial income of the community,  also throw a high expectation of YAM Wallet and YAMv3’s launch to the public.
2. Mid-term: Once the YAM wallet is launched, partial tokens be used as lottery rewards for the mining user, which can attract new users rushing into the pool, but users need to only go through the YAM wallet to enter the mining pool. There're three effects following--YAM wallet’s popularity, the rapid increasing users in mining pools, and the higher price expectations of YAMv3.
3. Long-term: Become decentralized banking system, compatible with cryptocurrency and fiat currency, link crypto financial services in the physical world, further to change the global fiat currency financial system. (The specific approach is still to be discussed)

The distribution of YAM wallet tokens: 
10% for airdrop, 
30% for sale, 
20% for mining pool lotto rewards,
  8% for wallet development team rewards, 
  2% for proposal rewards, 
30% as the executive team’s salary and ecosystem maintenance. 
The time is on the clerk, executive details authorizes the project team to decide.
I think this proposal can be a proper way to meet the interests of all community members, and will not cause the YAMv3 price to fall rapidly after the mining pool is exhausted; in the long-term development, the YAM community can also create a new Defi aspect.

YAM first come to my attention after the price crash due to bugs in a smart contract. I have been closely following YAM development including the V2 migration and this latest governance proposal.

In order for YAM to move forward, a good YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) system is urgently needed. While I see most of the new proposal here in one or another way asking for support for their proposal on governance system and etc... I strongly believe that the first and most important thing to do now is ""TO ESTABLISH A YIP SYSTEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PROPOSAL"".

After some discussion I come to the following proposal :

1) We Urgently Need To Establish A YIP System Before Proposing Any New Proposal
The main reason behind this is that the YIP system serve as a backbone for any new proposal before they can be agreed and implemented by the community.  Without a YIP system anyone can suggest a new proposal and things will become complicated fast before a solution can be found.

2) Any New Proposal Must Obtain Simple % of Vote Before Becoming Officail Suggested Proposal

3) Official Suggested Proposal Must Obtain Certain % of Vote And Cannot Exceed Certain % of Rejection Before Qualified As An Official Proposal

The 2 tiers system that I proposed above should be able to eliminate the weak proposal and allow majority community members to focus their precious time on studying only on the official suggested proposal (rather than all new proposals) before they vote to accept or reject the proposal.

As you can see I did not list specific % of vote require in 2) and 3) above, this is because I strongly believe that the community should be allowed to decide this after this proposal had been accepted.

Lastly, please give me your support on the YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) System to make YAMv3 a better system. Thank you.","['Yes - Accept This Proposal', 'No - Do Note Accept This Proposal']","[61625.52723251594, 2797.418693322693]",1

Delegators equal to or under 27 votes: 2,275 delegators * 27 YAM = 61,425 YAMv3
Delegators over 27 votes 1:1 = 286,780 YAMv3

129,QmSUbZ7zMs2nJ8iemVpDDEtpUWqpGuu3zE7zdozAxCvzjF,YIP-15: Delegator Reward Modification,"Trent Elmore and Brock Elmore submit the following proposal to increase delegator rewards.

While I believe the initial proposal was well in line with the expectations set, it has become apparent that many in the community disagree with the existing reward structure. Delegators showed great faith in the team and project, took on risk in showing this support, and are extremely valuable community members.

Many argue that delegators should not only be recouped for opportunity cost, but rewarded more generally for their commitment to the project. I agree and believe that, in return, it is fair that the community ask for their continued support of the project.

I propose a modification to the flat + scaled approach proposed in YIP-2: All delegators with votes equal to or less than 20 votes will receive a flat 20 YAMv3 reward, while all delegators with over 20 votes will receive a 1:1 reward. This ensures every delegator receives at least a 1:1 reward, whereas the original YIP-2 allocated some delegators significantly more than 1:1 and some significantly less.

Rewards breakdown:
- Equal to or Under 20 YAM Delegated: 2,100 delegators * 20 YAM = 42,000 YAMv3
- Over 20 YAM Delegated 1:1 = 290,665 YAMv3
- Total Delegator Rewards: 332,665 YAMv3

In total, this is a 92% (~159k) increase in delegator rewards, and delegators will receive 6.6% of the network, not including the potential community fund.

Rather than being immediately vested, however, these rewards will be unvested over a 1 month period, streamed on a block-by-block basis. This will promote the continued engagement of the delegator community.

In order to keep the total V3 supply in line with YIP-2 and YIP-12 potential supplies, I also propose to decrease the total LP Pool rewards from 1.1M to 940,923, following the same distribution scheme leading to ~282k in rewards the first week, decreasing by 30% each week.

I also propose that any rounding necessary to bring the supply to a whole number be left to developer discretion.

Finally, I propose that should this proposal be passed, additional proposals relating to delegator rewards will be considered invalid. 

TL;DR:
- Delegators with equal or under 20 votes receive 20 YAM
- Delegators with more than 20 votes receive 1:1 reward
- Total Rewards 332,665 (92% increase from YIP-2)

The proposed delegator reward distribution in YIP-2 does not reward YAMv1 delegators sufficiently. 242,953 YAMv1 delegated to save YAM, yet according to YIP-2 only 173,588.83 YAMv3 will be awarded. This isn't even a 1:1 reward. Under this model, delegators will receive a fraction of their original delegated amount as rewards. This proposal would remove the flat-reward model specified in YIP-2, correctly quantify the amount of YAMv1 delegated, multiply this amount by 2x, and distribute them by address on a pro-rata basis. 

Motivation
YAMv1 delegators are not getting sufficiently compensated for doing all they could to save YAM. Individuals who delegated, exited the YAM/yCrv pool which was yielding 100% ROI. These individuals also implicitly committed to staying out of the pool for 3 days and essentially missing out on a 300% ROI. 

The official YAM twitter even indicated that the original intention was that delegators would get ""significantly more"" YAM than those who remained in the pool. 
https://twitter.com/YamFinance/status/1293739908721446912
Under the current model proposed in YIP-2, this is not the case. 

YIP-2 calculated delegator rewards of 173,588.383, while 242,953 YAMv1 was delegated to save YAM. The proposed rewards do not even account all the YAM that was delegated to save YAM (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yam-finance/yam-protocol/master/yam_delegator_snapshot_10650187_draft.json).

Proposal
1. Correctly account for all the YAMv1 that was delegated (242,953), and multiply that by 2x. 
2. Distribute this amount as YAMv3 (485,906) on a pro-rata basis to addresses in this file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yam-finance/yam-protocol/master/yam_delegator_snapshot_10650187_draft.json) according to the percentage delegated.

Total YAMv3 delegator rewards would be 485,906 instead of 173,588.
Total YAMv3 supply would be:

3,726,411 (YAMv2)
1,100,000 (YIP-2 YAMv3 Liquidity Incentives)
485,906 (Delegator rewards)
= 5,312,317

Note: This excludes the 1m additional YAMv3 reserved for Treasury, which is under vote in YIP-8.

This proposal, if ratified, would redirect 1% of all inflows to the treasury to a [Gitcoin Grants Wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x232C95A72F132392171831cEcEc8c1161975c398), in order to support public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. If ratified, every funding from the YAM treasury that went to the Gitcoin Grants wallet would be 100% used for public goods funding for the Ethereum ecosystem.  This funding would be allocated to the [*Tech* Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/tech?) category.

This proposal was motivated by [a tweet from Nick Dodson](https://twitter.com/iamnickdodson/status/1294264371489767424?s=21 ).  There is plenty of discussion on that thread to checkout as you weigh your votes.

For the uninitiated, Gitcoin Grants is like a crypto-style patreon, powered by [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com), that has [delivered over $2.5mm of funding to Ethereum projects since Jan 2019](https://gitcoin.co/results).

There are many promising projects in the community that support public goods (like ETH1/ETH2 development, L2 research, media, education, etc).  Given Gitcoin's long history of successfully supporting public goods on Ethereum at scale, without being captured, through a tough bear market, I believe Gitcoin is the strongest contender at the current moment, in this category.

There are two main reasons that I believe this is a good idea for the YAM community:
1.  **Karma** -- Gitcoin Grants played a part in funding the transition form v1 => v2 [see this link](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1059/yam-protocol-audit). 
2. **High ROI Community Goodwill & Publicity**.  We can shift the narrative around YAMs being a ""degen"" project to having some ""regen"" effects to the ecosystem, like funding the base layer upon which it depends.  This will make YAMs part of the broader conversation around [rainbow colored money](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/rainbow-colored-money-the-story-behind) in the Ethereum ecosystem, and public goods funding in the information age.

If this proposal passes, I will commit to the following:
1. 100% of the tokens that go to this wallet from the YAM contracts will be sent to public goods (minus gas fees, which I expect to be fairly negligible).
2. Prominently listing YAMs as a co-funder of Gitcoin Grants Rounds, for each round it contributes funding.
3. I would be happy to provide a report back to the YAM community on where the YAM funds went, once per quarter, for every quarter in which the value that the YAM system provided to Gitcoin Grants was more than $10k USD.

I appreciate the consideration that the community has given to this proposal

YAM holders do not have the option of ignoring proposals as any proposal could be negative for the future of YAM and need to be voted down.

Therefore, making submitting a proposal incur a cost is needed to prevent too many proposals from being submitted.

A fresh proof-of-burn of 1 YAM should be required with each proposal submission to make it a valid submission. The Ethereum transaction ID of this burn should be attached to the proposal text. Burning involves transfer of 1 YAM or more to this Ethereum address:

0x000000000000000000000000000000000000AAAA

is not being used, as many Ethereum wallets will not allow a transfer to it.

This proposal would add functionality to the rebaser to call sync() on the ETH-YAMv3 Uniswap pool during rebase. This would make liquidity added to that pool safe from losing funds during rebase. This proposal does not include any additional incentives to be provided to LPs on this pool.

Reasoning:
Due to the fact that Uniswap tracks token balances internally, assets that rebase (like YAM) need to explicitly call sync() during rebase or a portion of the assets pooled can be stolen after rebase. Since ETH is the top pooled asset on Uniswap, it makes sense that we would want to encourage liquidity on the ETH-YAMv3 pool as well.

2] Mooniswap protects liquidity providers from arbitrage and front-running attacks. We saw this during the V1 Yam speculative bubble.

3] Providing liquidity on Mooniswap will allow the community to farm 1"" governance tokens and expand the influence of yam governance to other components of the DeFi market.

YAM first come to my attention after the price crash due to bugs in a smart contract. I have been closely following YAM development including the V2 migration and this latest governance proposal.

In order for YAM to move forward, a good YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) system is urgently needed. While I see most of the new proposal here in one or another way asking for support for their proposal on governance system and etc... I strongly believe that the first and most important thing to do now is ""TO ESTABLISH A YIP SYSTEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PROPOSAL"".

After some discussion I come to the following proposal :

1) We Urgently Need To Establish A YIP System Before Proposing Any New Proposal

The main reason behind this is that the YIP system serve as a backbone for any new proposal before they can be agreed and implemented by the community.  Without a YIP system anyone can suggest a new proposal and things will become complicated fast before any solution can be found. As a proof of my point there are around 40 new proposals which is to many for the community to digest at the time of my writing.

2) Any New Proposal Must Obtain Simple % of Vote Before Becoming Official Suggested Proposal

3) Official Suggested Proposal Must Obtain Certain % of Vote And Cannot Exceed Certain % of Rejection Before Qualified As An Official Proposal

The 2 tiers system that I proposal above should be able to eliminate the weak proposal and allow majority community members to focus their precious time on studying only on the official suggested proposal (rather than all new proposals) before they vote to accept or reject a proposal.

As you can see I did not list specific % of vote require in 2) and 3) above, this is because I strongly believe that the community should be allowed to decide this after this proposal had been accepted.

Lastly, please give me your support and vote to make YAM a better system. Thank you.","['Yes, Establish YIP Sytem', 'No, YIP System Is Not Needed']","[64.52507894814886, 2920.553258392235]",0

Our motivation for submitting this proposal is to ensure an efficient transition from V2 to V3 that addresses mission-critical issues in the most fair way for the largest amount of the community possible. We believe this is the best path forward, but it is up to the community to decide, this is not an exhaustive list of possible changes, and we do expect additional proposals to be submitted.

As mentioned in the Proposal Mechanics proposal, anyone can submit further proposals which may supersede and/or iterate upon the below.

Item 1: Minor Protocol Updates

We propose the following protocol updates. While there are many ideas on how the Yam protocol can be improved, we find it prudent to focus on minor updates that improve upon V1 with limited overhead.

- Update reserve asset to yUSD (yyCRV), which has higher yield potential than yCRV
- Replace YAMv1/yCRV sync() call on Uniswap V2 with YAMv3/yUSD sync() call
- Hardcode proposal (50K pre-rebase) and quorum (200k pre-rebase) thresholds
- Make voting period 2 days instead of 3 for quicker governance action
- Complete audit of fully functional YAMv3 protocol

Item 2: YAMv3 Incentivization Distribution

We propose a single farming pool be established on the YAMv3/yUSD (yyCRV) Uniswap V2 LP pool. The first week of incentives will begin one hour after V3 launch and total 330,000 YAMv3. Incentives will be reduced by 30% each week, resulting in a total of 1.1MM YAMv3 tokens distributed to stakers. 

We also propose a 1MM YAMv3 community fund, held outside the reserve in a separate community fund contract. This fund will be controlled by V3 governance, will not impact quorum requirements for voting, and can be used as the community sees fit. Uses may include but are not limited to new incentivized pools or ecosystem development initiatives.

TL;DR:
- YAM/yUSD LP Incentivized  Staking Pool, initial weekly issuance of 330k YAMv3, decreasing 30% each week, totaling 1.1MM.
- 1MM YAMv3 Community Fund

Item 3: YAMv2 to YAMv3 Migration

We propose a 1:1 migration for YAMv2 holders. A migration contract with no deadline will be created, which will allow YAMv2 holders to burn their YAMv2 tokens in exchange for YAMv3 tokens.

TL;DR:
- 1:1 migration from V2 to V3 via migration contract

Item 4: Delegator Rewards

We propose utilizing a snapshot taken at the time of the #saveyam governance proposal to reward delegators utilizing a “flat and scaled” reward model. The list of delegators can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yam-finance/yam-protocol/master/yam_delegator_snapshot_10650187_draft.json

The rewards will also be used to bring the total supply of YAMv3 to a round number, by the following calculation:

 (YAMv3 Total Supply) - (Community Fund) - (LP Pool Incentives) -  (YAMv2 Total Supply) = (Delegator Rewards)

Total delegator rewards will be approximately 173,588.383 YAMv3. We propose to distribute half (approximately 86,794.192) of these rewards on a flat basis to the 3,173 delegators, rewarding each delegate with approximately 27.354 YAMv3 tokens. The remaining 86,794.192 YAMv3 tokens will be distributed to delegators in proportion to their percentage of total votes delegated. This structure compensates small holders for their efforts and incurred transaction fees, as well as compensating all holders for their proportional impact.

These delegator rewards will be fully vested on V3 launch.

TL;DR:
- Approximately 173k in rewards, half distributed on flat scale to all delegators, half distributed proportional to voting contribution

Proposal Summary:

Total V3 Supply: 6,000,000

Protocol Updates: 
- Update reserve asset to yUSD (yyCRV), which has higher yield potential than yCRV.
- Call sync() on Uniswap V2 YAMv3/yUSD pool
- Hardcode proposal (50K) and quorum (200k) thresholds
- Make voting period 2 days instead of 3
- Complete audit of fully functional YAMv3 protocol

Farming and Incentives:
- YAM/yUSD LP Pool, receiving 330k YAMv3, decreasing 30% each week, totalling 1.1M.
- 1M YAMv3 Community Fund

Migration: 
- 1:1 migration from V2 to V3

Delegator Rewards:
- Approximately 173k in rewards, half distributed equally to all delegators, half distributed according to a linear scale of voting contribution

Should this proposal be passed, past and future proposals that do not conform to these mechanics will be considered invalid.

While the original launchers of Yam will be submitting proposals, this framework is intended to make clear that anyone meeting the minimum requirements is able to submit proposals, some of which may supersede ours. The power and value of YAM lies in the YAM community, and we are excited to see what the community brings to the table in this interim period and in YAMv3.

It should be noted that any proposal may not be implemented without approval from the YAM community. 

We're also thrilled and humbled by the support we've received from many in the DeFi community that have rallied behind us. One special shout out we'd like to give is to the Balancer and Snapshot Labs teams who built and are hosting this governance portal. This was something they did not have to do but graciously offered as we sought ways to limit our influence over this process.

Item 1:

We propose a 3 day minimum voting period, with a maximum voting period of 7 days. This will ensure tokenholders have adequate time to assess proposals and vote, while also ensuring an efficient process.

Item 2:

We propose all proposals must have a deadline prior to September 7, 2020, to ensure adequate time for code implementation prior to audit. This means the latest that a proposal can be submitted is September 4, 2020.

Item 3:

We propose that all proposals not approved by the deadline must be resubmitted in YAMv3 governance to be considered for implementation.

Item 4: 

We propose that a minimum of 100 YAMv2 be required to submit a proposal. This is to prevent proposal overload and ensure an efficient V2 to V3 governance process.

Item 5:

We propose to utilize the 4% quorum requirement initially set in V1 for approval of YAMv2 governance decisions.

Item 6:

We propose that when submitting a proposal, a block height for a snapshot of balances must be chosen. The snapshot of balances will serve as ground truth for voting power. This block must be the current block at the time of proposal start time (+/- 15 minutes). Any proposal found not to do this will be disregarded and considered invalid, even if it achieves sufficient votes.

Item 7:

We propose that in the event of conflicting approved proposals, priority will be given to the proposal that was approved most recently.

","The Biswap team constantly searches for new ways of advancement and analyses the DeFi industry. Via the precise evaluation, it is vivid that the market is moving in the prospect of such spheres: NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships between strong projects. Those spheres have epic volumes and thousands of active users on Binance Smart Chain.

The team thoroughly monitors requests from the Biswap community and has received a great number of requests concerning the implementation of new directions which are highly popular in DeFi.

Each one of you is the main navigator in the development of the global Biswap DEX. All your support inspires us to make aims real. Your active participation in the decision-making with Biswap like the Community Voting has shown incredible result: Binance Labs has officially announced the strategic investment in the improvement of Biswap!

Such outcomes of the synergy between the project and community when both support one idea motivates us to reach even higher peaks and we are extremely grateful for all of that!

Due to the reason that together we look in the same direction and you support our decisions, we want to evolve in popular directions like NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships.

Advantages of the Biswap evolvement in the popular directions:
🌐 Powerful and greater Biswap ecosystem
🌐 New levels and records in DeFi
🌐 Strengthening of the BSW token
🌐 Involvement of thousands of new users to Biswap DEX
🌐 Lucrative opportunities for community
🌐 Huge partnerships possibilities
🌐 Greater volumes and statistics
🌐 BSW token burnings

The Path of Implementing New Biswap Directions 
Successful releases require a substantial amount of resources. In order to release the prospective directions of NFT (Earn), GameFi (Earn to Play), and Strategic Partnerships in the Biswap ecosystem, it is necessary to affect the BSW tokenomics by redistributing 70 mln BSW tokens for those purposes.

In the meantime, 6 mln BSW tokens got used, during 5 months, out of 100 mln BSW tokens allocated for Transaction Fee Mining (Fee Return) in BSW tokenomics. We see that this amount is a lot for the Fee Return. By taking the dynamic speed of development of the DeFi sector into account, we offer: redistribute 70 mln BSW from the Transaction Fee Mining pool. 

📍This amount will be redistributed gradually over a substantial period.

So, 24 mln  BSW will be left for Fee Return after Biswap uses 70 mln to expand the ecosystem of the project and provide new products for Biswappers. The future depiction of Biswap tokenomics in favor of new Biswap directions only shows that modifications won’t negatively influence users’ earnings or opportunities on Biswap.

The BSW tokenomics could be modified in the following way:

Max Supply: 700 000 000 BSW tokens

600 mln  BSW tokens are allocated as follows:

80.7% — Farms & Launchpools
4.3 % — Referral Program
5 % — Investment Fund
1 % — SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)
9 % — Team


100 mln BSW tokens will be distributed:
70 mln BSW for NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships
30 mln BSW for Transaction Fee Mining.
 
The rest of the Fee Return pool left after the changes in BSW tokenomics (24 mln BSW tokens) is a substantial amount that will continue to reward Biswappers, along with mighty NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships releases implemented for further globalization of the Biswap DEX!
Here are the proposals:
🔥🔥🔥 Option 1: Improve the tokenomics and help the project rapidly grow:
80.7% - Farms & Launchpools
4.3 % - Referral Program
5 % - Investment Fund
1% - SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)
9% - Team
100 mln BSW tokens from Fee Return will distributed:
70 mln BSW for NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn) and Strategic Partnerships
30 mln BSW for Transaction Fee Mining.
❌ Option 2: Keep the tokenomics as it is:
80.7% - Farms & Launchpools
4.3 % - Referral Program
5 % - Investment Fund
1% - SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)
9% - Team
100 mln BSW tokens from Fee Return will be kept with no integration of new direction for Biswap.

Supply cap: 10M sUSD → 20m sUSD (proposed increase of supply cap)

DEX Liquidity: ~$50m+

Normal mode:

LTV: 60%

Liquidation threshold: 75%

Liquidation penalty: 5%

E-mode:

Assets: Stablecoins

Max LTV: 97%

Proposal: Increase of supply cap by 100% to 20m sUSD

The current sUSD supply cap on v3 is 10m sUSD and has been reached shortly after the launch of AAVE and Optimisms liquidity mining program on AAVE V3.

The proposal’s goal is to suggest an increase of 100% to 20m sUSD supply cap via the fast-track process as outlined here

Reasons for increase:

sUSD Dex Liquidity: Despite market conditions, sUSD DEX liquidity vastly increased across Optimism on Curve, Uniswap, Velodrome, and others. This can facilitate healthy liquidations if ever necessary.

sUSD’s Healthy Peg: Throughout the entire time sUSD has been an asset on AAVE, it has held peg and has not decreased within 1% of the expected peg of $1. This is due to increased sUSD Dex liquidity, and constant arbitrage of the peg by market makers.

Optimism Liquidity Mining: Due to the ongoing OP liquidity mining program on AAVE V3, the sUSD supply cap has been hit very quickly. To ensure that more users are able to supply/borrow on AAVE, it is important to increase this supply cap to ensure that there is ample amounts of sUSD available on AAVE.

We look forward to the discussion on increasing the Supply Cap of sUSD on v3 by 100% to 20m sUSD.

Note: We’ve used the template set by sAVAX when they’ve increased their supply cap via Fast-Track as well.","['Increase sUSD Supply Cap to 20m', 'Leave sUSD Supply Cap as is']","[196077.2304893065, 2.5928164406521033]",1

Support Documentation: Avalanche Bridge | Avalanche Support

## Summary

This is a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset. BTC.b is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge.

## Motivation

The Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community, introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology. The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and off-ramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi. It is a seamless, easy and secure process.

## Driving Factors

Secure: the bridge must be audited and built with security-first technologies.
Cost-Effective: the cost of bridging assets should be low.
Fast: the transaction should take the least amount of time possible.
Transparent: users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process.
Intuitive: users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge.
Specifications

### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team.

### Provide a high-level overview of the project and the token

Ava Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups. Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages.

BTC.b is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is non-custodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest on/off ramps to the Bitcoin network.

### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral?

BTC.b is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest, easiest and safest way to get BTC on-chain. As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTC.b allows another avenue to get BTC on-chain.

BTC.b is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, Pangolin, Benqi, and Paraswap.

### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Avalanche’s primary network consisting of its X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain went live a little over a year ago with on-chain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime. C-Chain is an EVM-compatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages.

The Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi, peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum. Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush, Avalanche’s liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021, attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users. Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away.

### How is the asset currently used?

Currently, there is about $28M worth of BTC.b bridged to Avalanche C-Chain. Some of the top protocols with BTC.b integrated include $30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance, the Avalanche native stableswap, $2.6M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol, and $14M of liquidity for the AVAX-BTC.b pair within the AMM Trader Joe.

### Emission schedule
No emission schedule

### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

The bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8. The wardens include Ankr, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, Protofire, Avascan, Ava Labs, Bware Labs, and Halborn. BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet. This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet.

The number of holders: 408

### How It Works/Technical Specifications

The Bridge can be broken down into two main parts: the SGX application and a set of third-party indexers and verifiers called “Wardens.” The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing. The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network. For security reasons, neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users. Instead, they’ll explicitly whitelist each other’s IP addresses for direct communication. In addition, all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature. For relaying information to the Bridge user base, each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings, assets requirements, and attestation report. The front end is set to disable itself if there’s any discrepancy within the critical information.

### Proposed Technical Parameters

BTC.b is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV, a 75 percent liquidation threshold, and a 6.5 percent liquidation penalty. With the level of on-chain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTC.b back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins, these parameters are safe.","['Yes', 'No']","[200698.6656802891, 7.371994557502667]",1

status: Proposal
author: 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmony’s Horizon Bridge.

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop.

Specification
If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.","['Yes, Freeze Harmony V3 Market', 'No, Keep Harmony V3 Market As Is']","[112999.61141516424, 101.36785734609067]",1

## Summary

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.
The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. 

agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.

At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.

There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). 
Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.

Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.

The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).
The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

agEUR has a Chainlink feed on Polygon with USD.

## Audits

We have had four different audits which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits)

## Benefits for Aave V3

agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg.

One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.

Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.

Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.

Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.



## Risk Parameters

With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.

V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon

Pocket is a decentralized RPC protocol with a permissionless network of over 45.000 incentivized nodes. This gives us the best resilience in the market with latency comparable to leading centralized providers, while being decentralized. Dapps that use Pocket Network’s RPC get to own their service and the more they use it, the cheaper it gets. As opposed to other providers, rather than paying a monthly fee that is a recurring cost, Dapps using Pocket get allocated RPC service based on a POKT stake, which allows them to own their infra in a liquid way. By using Pocket, Aave will be actively incentivizing decentralization as the more traffic is served by the network, more rewards are generated, causing more nodes to be spun up for the chains in question.

Rationale:

We have learned that Aave currently uses a basket of public RPCs for servicing the end user relays. Team members have expressed the desire to improve this solution as it is not very stable and there are recurring problems in service from these different public RPCs. This is especially problematic for mainnet ETH & Polygon for which POKT provides dedicated RPCs.

By providing Pocket Endpoints to Aave’s user facing RPC we can improve the RPC service level (both latency and % uptime) and contribute to Aave’s decentralization by providing it with the most decentralized infrastructure in the market, making it more resilient and censorship resistant, while allowing Aave to own their service through its stake.

We have developed a contract and method based permissioning method that will be implemented for AAVE’s endpoint, so that it can only be used to interact with AAVE protocol.

Proposal:

We believe a good start is to provide this service with an app stake that’s good for 25M relays (won’t get rate limited if exceeded) and later ramp up depending on performance, user feedback and how much the DAO is willing to invest.

Pocket Network would stake 118,815 POKT on behalf of AAVE DAO. This would be funded as follows:

Budget:

25M Relays:

$POKT 118,815

$POKT price at time of posting: $0.138 USD per POKT

Total: $16,396.47 USD

Goals:

1) Improve stability in Aave’s public facing Web3 infrastructure.
2) Decentralization of Aave’s front end RPC.
3) Give Aave ownership of its RPC service via owning the POKT token.
4) Further promote decentralization in the Aave and crypto communities.
5) Raise awareness of Pocket’s service and mission to decentralize web3 infra.
6) Encourage other projects to decentralize their infra with Pocket Network.

Milestones:

1) Integration: Integration of Aave with Pocket via inclusion of a simple URL addition
2) Onboarding/Testing: Testing of the Pocket Network endpoint. Tech support provided by Pocket engineers
3) Ramp up: Allocation of a certain % (equivalent to 25M Relays) of Aave traffic to Pocket Network
4) Increase of % and Pokt stake if service is performing as desired;
Proposal content in short

We propose an addition of Aave’s frontend RPCs to Pocket Network, in order to solve stability problems currently experienced in the use of public RPC’s (especially on mainnet), as expressed by the community.

We are offering an endpoint with a stake for 25M relays that won’t get rate limited and to be ramped up in a phased manner.

To fund this we are asking the AAVE community the funds to buy 118,815 $POKT which will represent their service stake, allowing for AAVE to send up to 25M Relays per day.","['Yes', 'No']","[117204.92440409612, 8.832478336716688]",1

A proposal to whitelist deBridge, a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol, for Portals V3 on all chains where Aave v3 is deployed – with credit lines for USDC ($4M per chain), USDT ($4M per chain), and ETH (2000 ETH per chain).

## Overview

**[deBridge](https://debridge.finance/)** is a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol that enables decentralized transfers of arbitrary data and assets between blockchains. The protocol is an infrastructure platform and framework for:
- Cross-chain composability of smart contracts
- Cross-chain swaps (deSwap is one of the applications built on top of deBridge that enables capital-efficient cross-chain swaps)
- Bridging of any arbitrary asset and data
- Interoperability and bridging of NFTs

In deBridge, we strongly believe in the concept of composable finance where a combination of different DeFi primitives or protocols enables solutions with the highest level of capital- efficiency that can’t be achieved by standalone protocols or applications. deBridge was designed to be fully compatible with the existing DeFi ecosystem, and **[deSwap](https://app.debridge.finance/deswap)** is a good example of this. It leverages deBridge’s generic messaging framework in order to provide users and protocols with the ability to perform a capital-efficient cross-chain conversion between arbitrary liquid assets, all in one transaction

More information about deSwap can be found **[here](https://blog.debridge.finance/any-arbitrary-cross-chain-swaps-with-debridge-1inch-network-862212087d6a)**. 


Instead of reinventing the wheel and developing a dedicated AMM or DEX, we integrated with Curve to utilize its capital-efficient stableswap AMM and partnered up and integrated with the liquidity aggregator 1inch. This design allows deSwap to source liquidity and routing from existing protocols. This is much more effective than running meaningless liquidity mining campaigns to have a ton of idle liquidity sitting as TVL with near-zero utilization. We truly believe it's more reasonable to source liquidity from a protocol like AAVE when it's needed and to do revenue sharing between the protocols. 

**Portals enable a great synergy between deBridge and AAVE** by bringing additional utilization for locked liquidity in AAVE as well as providing a new type of routing for cross-chain swaps through deSwap, where no intermediary pools or wrapped tokens are needed. In addition, the integration will facilitate atomic transfers of positions between Aave instances on different chains which ease cross-chain interactions with no need to switch wallets/networks.

## Technical Specifications

deBridge is an infrastructure for developers and projects to integrate with or use to build any type of cross-chain applications and primitives. The design of the deBridge protocol consists of two layers:
Protocol layer – on-chain smart contracts deployed on every blockchain supported by deBridge.
Infrastructure layer – off-chain validation nodes operated by validators that are elected by and work for deBridge governance. (List of active validators can be found [here](https://explorer.debridge.finance/validation-progress).

More details about the technical implementation and design of the deBridge protocol can be found in our [documentation portal](https://docs.debridge.finance/).

The protocol has been live since February and has processed over $45M in volume, 80k+ cross-chain transactions, 45k+ unique users, and generated over $120,000 in fees for the protocol and validators securing the network. 

The major activity in the protocol has been generated by deSwap, a cross-chain swap solution built on top of the deBridge generic messaging protocol. deSwap enables decentralized cross-chain conversion of arbitrary liquid assets. Here is some useful information: 

**If applicable the number of routers, total liquidity of routers**
Cross-chain swaps are currently routed through the deUSDC/deETH liquidity pools at Curve protocol which have ~$9M of liquidity provided by deBridge users and partners. A complete list of liquidity pools can be found here: Cross-Chain Swaps Liquidity - deBridge

**Is liquidity incentivized?**
At this moment liquidity is not incentivized. Liquidity providers receive 2 BPs in the form of trading fees from Curve. Anyone can provide liquidity to the protocol.

Once control over the protocol is passed to governance, there is a plan to submit a governance proposal to the deBridge DAO to retroactively reward participants proportionally to how they have helped out the protocol in the early stages

**Is there a fee model for participants?**

The protocol takes a 10bps fee from every transaction (5bps go to validators and their delegators that help to secure the protocol, and another 5 bps go to deBridge treasury)

Dune dashboard: https://dune.com/mak5577/DeBridge

Bridge and cross-chain swaps for users: https://app.debridge.finance/

Technical documentation: https://docs.debridge.finance/

At this stage cross-chain swaps are routed through the intermediary deUSDC pool at Curve which sets the maximal amount of swap being limited by liquidity in the pool (https://docs.debridge.finance/deswap/cross-chain-swaps-liquidity). The credit line provided by Portals will solve this problem by enabling new routings and more capital-efficient cross-chain swaps with larger transactions, limited only by the amount of the credit line.
One of the unique features of deBridge is the cross-chain ""transactions bundling"" where an arbitrary set of actions can be packed into one cross-chain interaction, e.g. users can do a cross-chain swap and supply the resulting liquidity to AAVE. 
The liquidity from Portals will be used in various scenarios:
1) Facilitate liquidity inflow into AAVE v3 on different chains so users can supply liquidity using any arbitrary asset on any chain supported by deBridge.
2) Let anyone automatically transfer positions across instances of AAVE v3 on different chains.
3) Utilized for routing of cross-chain swaps performed by users/protocols through deSwap.
4) Any applications and projects that integrate the [deSwap API](https://debridge.finance/api) which will use Portals’ liquidity bringing additional monetization to the AAVE protocol.

We have prepared for the Aave community an application POC for swap + deposit into AAVE in a single transaction: https://stake-aave.debridge.finance/stake-aave

Once the deSwap widget is integrated into the AAVE application, all users of the AAVE UI will utilize liquidity of Portals to perform above-mentioned interactions with the protocol. This is an example of ETH liquidity routing on Ethereum which is converted into AVAX and supplied to AAVE on Avalanche:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5cNShm5.png)


Once integrated with Portals, its credit line will be used instead of deUSDC.

## Technical implementation
Integration with Portals is to be performed through a dedicated deAaveAdapter smart contract that will be developed by the deBridge team and audited by our security partner Halborn. This smart contract utilizes the deBridge generic messaging protocol and interacts with Portals (AAVE Pools). 

It receives liquidity from the user, then redeems the loan on one chain and takes the same amount of credit to another chain. Whenever users or protocols perform a cross-chain swap, the following set of actions is performed by the smart contract:
1. Accept liquidity from the sender on chain A (e.g. Arbitrum) and check if there is any unbacked amount to be repaid
2. Pay the outstanding amount and lock the remaining liquidity in the deAaveAdapter
3. Send a message to the deAaveAdapter on chain B (e.g. Polygon) through deBridge. The message contains a command to take a loan, redeem aToken and transfer liquidity to the receiver

Once the transaction initiated on Chain A is final and irreversible, the deBridge infrastructure will execute the transaction on the destination Chain B in the following sequence:
1. Execution of the passed message in the external call to deAaveAdapter
2. deAaveAdapter will mint the needed amount of aTokens by calling mintUnbacked function of Portals
3. deAaveAdapter will redeem received aTokens and transfer the resulting tokens to the receiver by calling withdraw method of AAVE protocol

This design of deAaveAdapter guarantees that the liquidity lent from Portals on one chain is always backed by the same amount of asset locked in deAaveAdapter on another chain. By this design, liquidity that was lent to deSwap always remains in AAVE’s possession as any user/protocol can bridge assets from the chain with an outstanding loan to unlock the corresponding amount of the same asset locked in the deAaveAdapter on another chain. 
This diagram shows the general flow of a cross-chain interaction when deSwap will be integrated with Portals:

![](https://i.imgur.com/QoCmmH9.png)

## Proposed list Credit Line request
The credit lines to be allocated to deBridge are requested for each blockchain where AAVE v3 is deployed. deBridge is currently deployed on 6 blockchains and one of the reasons we haven’t deployed on others has been the lack of liquidity for deSwap. Portal is solving this problem and deBridge will prioritize integration to have the list of supported blockchains matching those where Portals are deployed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Llsbqfn.png)

The maximal amount of the cross-chain swap that can be performed by users and protocols in one transaction is capped by the amount of approved credit line. deBridge will pay a 2bps fee on all the liquidity taken from the Portals
 
#### Incentives
An incentive program may be approved by the deBridge DAO after the deBridge token goes live.

### Audits & Security
List of relevant security audits of the network
Security has always been our main priority. deBridge has passed four independent security audits by reputable companies such as 
- Halborn 
- Zokyo
- Ackee Blockchain
- Neodyme 

All security audit reports can be found on our [Github](https://github.com/debridge-finance/debridge-security).

deBridge has a long-term partnership with [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) that audits not only smart contracts but all the modules created for the protocol. 
We also have an ongoing bug bounty program on Immunefi:
https://immunefi.com/bounty/debridge/

We have done extensive research and seen that many bridges are missing various security measures like basic balance sheet validation and nonce sequence validation. These crucial components among others have been implemented in deBridge. More details about our cross-chain security strategies can be found here:

# Simple Summary

Acquire 100,000 BAL tokens by deploying a Bonding Curve contract. The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].

# Abstract

Deploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.

Aave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.

# Motivation

The original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].

With the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.

With 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].

With the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].

Having not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.

There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.

# Implementation

A Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].

The 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.

# Simple Summary

Acquire 200,000 BAL tokens via a combination of performing a BAL for AAVE token swap. The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].

# Abstract

Perform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. 

All 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. 

Initially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.

# Motivation

Aave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].

When the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.

In addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.

By exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.

Aave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.

The initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].

The initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].

With 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.

# Implementation

The token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].

The aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].

Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.

The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools

title: ARC - Update Risk Parameters Mainnet Arc Market
status: Proposed
author: @MatthewGraham, @ncitron, 3SE Holdings and UHOM
Created: 10/04/2022

----

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes updating the mainnet Arc market Loan to Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold to be the same asset listed on mainnet V2 market, as determined by Gauntlet.

# Abstract

The risk parameters on the mainnet Arc market are currently not being maintained and are more conservative than those belonging to the same asset on mainnet V2 market. This proposal recommends updating the mainnet Arc market LTV parameter to match the LiquidationThreshold of the same asset listed on mainnet V2 market.

We intend to re-propose a quarterly update of the risk parameters for the mainnet Arc market quarterly in an attempt to keep both markets in sync with mainnet V2 market, or mainnet V3 once live.

# Motivation

This risk parameter change is targeting the following improvements on the Aave Arc Market:

* Align Risk Parameters - The risk parameters on Aave Arc market are currently more conservative and are in need of being updated to better reflect the mainnet V2 market and also the risk profile of the user.
* Improve UX - Increasing LTV ratios and reducing the Liquidity Penalty enables greater capital efficiency across the market.

Given the extra precaution shown when approving Borrowers on the Aave Arc Market, the recommendation is to amend the LTV to reflect the risk profiles of market participants. For now, the intent is to maintain the mainnet Arc market in line with the mainent V2 market on a quarterly basis.

# Specification

The below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and their respective risk parameters on the mainnet Arc market.

Forum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630

Proposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)

### Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.

There’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.

### Risk Parameters

* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain

### Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Core team at QiDao Protocol.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.

Despite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.

MAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.

MAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.
* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance
* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.

5. How is the asset currently used?

* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)
* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap
* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave

6. Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

* Market Cap: ~$250M
* 24h Volume: >$40M
* Volatility: Low
* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose

## Summary

The Llama Community would like to ask for your support in listing CVX as a collateral asset. CVX is the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol.

## Motivation

CVX is not currently listed on major lending markets, including CVX on the platform would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage. This has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earn asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around $578.04k at the time of writing.

In addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).

##  Specification

**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**

Llama Community has presented a proposal to deposit Aave community funds into Curve and Convex Finance. Listing CVX on Aave enables Aave to earn aCVX tokens which can then be used to support the treasury management proposal detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).

**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?**

Convex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted $CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV.. Adding support for $CVX will in turn provide future opportunities as Convex will also support other protocols in time. ie: FXS

CVX is the governance token of the Convex protocol. By locking $CRV for life on Convex, each user gives his veCRV voting power to vlCVX holders (CVX lockers). Every vlCVX holders can vote on Convex governance proposals but also Curve governance proposals and gauges weights (5.05 veCRV/vlCVX). In the future, each vlCVX holders will control voting power on other tokens like FXS (users already can lock for life FXS for cvxFXS but vlCVX holders cannot vote on Frax governance proposals and gauges weights).

**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**

CVX would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem. Adding CVX creates another use case outside of the Convex tokenomics model. Llama expects the CVX demand to be similar to CRV. Additionally:

* Significant Borrow Demand: Users can borrow CVX and then either stake or lock the CVX token to earn yield. In addition to direct yield, investors may borrow CVX to lock and then influence how the inflation schedule of CRV and CVX is distributed. CRV has one of the highest utilisations and dollar value borrowed of all high volatility assets listed on Aave V2.
* CVX holders can deposit (lend) CVX and then borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).

Llama Community intends to use the aCVX revenue generated to support Treasury Management activities. In this instance, aCVX could be redeemed and locked on Convex to then influence how the CRV and CVX inflation schedule is distributed. Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools.

There is $43.2M TVL on the sAAVE pool and $11.8M TVL on the AAVE pool on Convex.

The Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave. The community will enjoy extra revenues from the reserve factor.

**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**

Convex, as DeFi farmers themselves, the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto-selling. They also believe CRV stakers should be rewarded more as they are effectively, mining together with Liquidity Providers. They intend to change that with Convex by charging a lower performance fee, returning fees back to the CRV stakers and CVX token holders, and distributing rewards directly.

The concept of Convex was published to the public on April 15, 2021 with the protocol launching on May 17, 2021.

30th April 2021 - [Convex platform was whitelisted on the Curve platform](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-57-whitelist-the-convex-protocol/1654%20and%20Vote%20results:%20https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/44)

7th September 2021 - [CVX vote locking went live](https://convexfinance.medium.com/september-update-vote-locking-launch-liquidity-provider-incentives-and-more-1380f406f725)

**5. How is the asset currently used?**

The CVX token governs over 559M$ worth of CRV locked in the protocol (and $4M worth of CVX in the Convex treasury multisig). CVX is currently only available on 2 Fuse pools, however there is no liquidity there.

**6. Emission schedule**

The emission schedule can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics).

**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**

**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)


# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.

# About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.

jFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.

We have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).

Combined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).

We also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.

We debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:

- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).
- $78M of volume on our primary market.
- 33k swaps by 9k users.
- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).
- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).
- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.
- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.

# Benefits for Aave V3
### Fiat on and off-ramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.

We have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).

Having jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.

### Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).

### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.

### DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.

### Low risk collateral
As collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.


# Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:

1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.

# Security specification and risks

### Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.


[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)


### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.

There is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.

It does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.

Forum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-ageur-on-aave-v3-on-polygon/7325


## Summary

The purpose of this AIP is to list agEUR, Angle Protocol's decentralized Euro, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon.

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.  
The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin in November. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 129m, a TVL in the protocol > $225m, and an average daily volume > $4m.

agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains, like on Polygon with the PoS bridge.

So far, there are more than 8m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity on Quickswap ($14m liquidity) and on Curve (~$2.5m).  
Besides Quickswap and Curve on Polygon, on mainnet agEUR has liquidity pools on UniswapV3 ($48m liquidity for agEUR/USDC), Sushiswap ($11m for agEUR/ANGLE) and Curve ($130m). The stablecoin can be minted in a capital-efficient way at oracle value from the protocol meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.

Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora and Fuse.

The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 155%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).

agEUR has no Chainlink feed yet but it passes all the security requirements to get eligible to a feed. If this Snapshot vote is positive, then the Chainlink team could setup this oracle pretty rapidly.

## Security Considerations and Risk Analysis

Angle has had three different audits by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits). It also has a $500k bug bounty on Immunefi.

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token (which went live in January)

Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (Guillaume Nervo, Picodes, Pablo Veyrat), Julien Bouteloup, 0xMaki and SebVentures.

agEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the multisig described above. Only protocol related contracts have minting rights on this contract, and so there's no multisig or EOA that can directly mint agEUR at the moment.
agEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a multisig on Polygon. Only Polygon PoS has the minting right on the contract.

agEUR has been assessed by Curve Team, report is available [here](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/ageur-angle-protocol?utm_source=url)

## Benefits for Aave V3

agEUR could be an interesting asset for Aave V3 efficiency modes: for instance if there is an efficiency mode with other Euro stablecoins, we could imagine people taking advantage of Aave V3 to get significant leverage and to arb the stablecoin back to peg (leveraging Curve and potentially Quickswap as well).

Angle community could even push for shifting incentives from Quickswap to UniV3 on Polygon to allow for better arbs leveraging Aave.

agEUR could also be another asset in Aave’s Polygon efficiency mode for stablecoins in general allowing for interesting FX arbs here as well.

On top of that, in the first place agEUR could be used in isolation mode which means this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.

As for the overall benefit of agEUR for the Aave community, many agEUR holders are looking for a reliable place to deposit their stablecoins and get a simple yield on this. Aave would provide this use case.  
More generally, many DeFi farmers are coming from Europe and want to get a yield on their home currency without being exposed to a USD/EUR change risk. Listing agEUR on Aave would open the gates for many institutional players coming to get yield on their €.

Besides arbitrageurs, we could expect borrowers of agEUR to be people wanting to either take advantage of the different yield opportunities provided by LPing agEUR or by people wanting to get leveraged on another asset while being exposed to the € price of it (and not the $).

## Risk Parameters

With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, the following parameters are proposed:

1.  V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
2.  V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
3.  V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 5M$ debt ceiling

## Protocol Data

### Market Data

- Market Cap: $145m, ($8.7m on Polygon)
- 24h volume: typically ranges between $2-$20m

### Social Channels

- Twitter: 25.9k
- Discord: 31.2k

### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:

On mainnet:

-   **Date of Deployment**: Oct 23rd 2021
-   **Number of Transactions**: 2347 and 15614 transfers
-   **Number of holders for token**: 489 (NB: there are many incentive programs involving LPs of agEUR which means actual amount of holders is higher)

On Polygon:

-   **Date of Deployment**: Nov 23rd 2021
-   **Number of Transactions**: 683and 5976 transfers
-   **Number of holders for token**: 162

Forum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-alusd-as-borrowable-to-aave-v2/7191

# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.

# About Alchemix and alUSD
Alchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.

Alchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.

Alchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.
1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.
2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD
3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.
4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.
5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.

alUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.

These mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.

# Motivation
alUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.

Going forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.

# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users
alUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.

# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis
Certik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf

Currently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.

Aave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.

The Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.

## Background
The discussion about Aave on Starknet [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploying-aave-on-starknet/6726).


## Introduction
A proposal to start bootstrapping the Aave ecosystem over Starkware has received good support from the Aave community, as it allows to expand to a new and promising environment, following the lead of Aave v3 with rollups.

This bootstrapping was proposed to be executed in 2 phases: an initial one getting in touch with the new technology, while still building something valuable for the Aave and Starknet communities; and a second one, more ambitious, most probably porting Aave v3 to Starknet.

As the facilitator of the project, I outline on this document the details of Phase I, including scope, time estimation, team members and budget allocation request from the Aave DAO.


## Phase I. Scope

### The project. aTokens bridge
As explained on the initial post, the target of the initial Phase is simplicity, while adding value for the communities.

One of the options was to create some kind of pooling model, for people to deposit and withdraw from Aave Ethereum without ever touching Ethereum and its (current) high gas cost. Since that initial proposal, the idea has been refined together with the built team.

Phase I will pursue the same goals as the original pooling idea, but this will be done by building wrappers and smart contracts around the canonical Starknet bridges, for the aTokens of Aave Ethereum. Following similar idea as pioneered by Aavegotchi with maTokens, together with some extra bridging infrastructure on both the Ethereum and Starknet sides, this model will allow to:

Build the basic blocks for products to integrate easily with Aave from Starknet. Including smart contracts and interaction libraries.
Solve some interesting and useful challenges, like cross-chain liquidity mining.
Boost Starknet’s user base, by providing Aave facilities.
Keep simplicity.
In terms of user flow, the system will provide smart contracts infrastructure to:

Users entering on Starknet via CEXes or on-ramp services to deposit on Aave Ethereum, just by buying an aToken equivalent on Starknet.
Same for withdrawals, by selling the aToken equivalent on Starknet.
New opportunities to liquidity providers to build on top of that, potentially monetising the movement of liquidity between Ethereum and Starknet.


### Timeline
The project is estimated to take a total of 2 to 3 months, with the variability depending on the implementation of the most experimental aspects, like the cross-chain liquidity mining.

As part of the facilitator role, I will post bi-weekly updates on the state of the project, informing the community on the progress on all aspects.

A more detailed timeline is the following:
![Timeline](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/7edbf24a3327584d6bdd5a4da617a801dfd85ba8.jpeg)

The project start will be marked by the execution of the on-chain proposal requesting the initial funds of the project.

### Team
Since the initial proposal, multiple teams showed interest on participating on the project. Considering the final scope, the team will be formed by:

- 1 facilitator of the project, part-time.
- 1 frontend/backend developer, part-time.
- 3 Cairo/Solidity developers, full-time.
- 1 Solidity developer part-time (depending on availability and need).
- **Total**: 3 full time and 2-3 part time.
The team is balanced to have expertise on the Aave ecosystem and Starknet.

### Budget breakdown
Salaries. Covering the full scope of the project, estimated for 3 months and to not be modified unless the final timeline is too short (>1.5 month less) or too long (>1.5 month long).
Gas cost. For deployments of contracts, plus all managerial efforts concerning mainly the payments from the Aave DAO.
Audit. We plan to engage 2 audit firms, both with EVM/Solidity expertise and at least one with Starknet/Cairo experience.
Bug bounty. Maximum to be spent, but most probably over-estimated if no important issues are found.
Buffer. 10% of the total budget.
![budget](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/7fc0a6a7abe4bdc0d0b7295ac8bf002d7dd299fa.png)


### Payments
For the Starkware part, the payments will be managed as coordinated between the Starknet team, the facilitator and the team members.

For the Aave part, 2 payments are proposed, to be requested via proposals on the Aave governance:

At the start of the project, 100’000$ to cover mainly fixed expenses.
Before starting audits (beginning Month 3), $92’500.
Any reconciliation of budget (e.g. return unused funds) will be done at the end of the project, with the bug bounty being kept by the team during 1 year, and then returned to the governance if not used.

Given the nature of the development, the payment will be done on stable assets from the Aave treasury.

### Deliverables
Smart contracts (Ethereum/Starknet) for wrapping and bridging of aTokens, fully open source and with a permissive license like MIT.
Full documentation of the codebase, architecture and model in general.
Public audits.
Continuous update to the community about the project.

### Next steps
- This Snapshot proposal to ratify the project.
- If passed, create on-chain proposal to request the initial funds.
- Start the project development.","['Approve', 'Not approve']","[210656.82968825984, 0.0890741494072324]",1

Title: MakerDAO Multi-Collateral Dai onboarding on the AAVE Arc Market

Status: Proposal

Authors: @zxMori_MakerDAO, on behalf of the MakerDAO Growth CU


Abstract
This proposal aims to jumpstart the onboarding process for Multi Collateral Dai on the Aave Arc Market. Dai is a stablecoin backed by multiple collateral types, mainly ETH, WBTC and other stablecoins such as USDP (Paxos Dollar) and USDC (Circle USD Coin).

Collateralization components of Dai on 2021-12-27. See more at https://daistats.com

986×520 40.9 KB
Fig. 1: Collateralization components of Dai on 2021-12-27. See more at https://daistats.com

Maker users can open positions in the protocol, mint Dai against their collateral and are able to either hold Dai or use it to leverage yield farming opportunities on the DeFi space.

Dai’s position in the markets
Dai is the premiere stablecoin available for use in DeFi protocols. It, being crypto-native allows users to borrow an amount of stablecoins leveraging their crypto positions, without the need to sell their volatile assets. This allows for a wide range of use cases, from simple stable borrowing to complex leveraged positions, enabled by the Maker Protocol.

The amount of Dai in circulation as of 2021-12-27 amounts to ~$9.3B, making it the biggest crypto native stablecoin on offer in the market. Due to this, many protocols on the Ethereum ecosystem (and on sidechains such as Polygon, Avalanche, and Fantom) accept Dai positions.

Dai services for institutions
MakerDAO has facilities for institutional clients to leverage their own positions (either crypto, via regular vaults - or real-world assets via RWA vaults 1). This proposal, thus, aligns with our institutional offerings - since having Dai on a permissioned market that institutions can enter will allow them to get right into into DeFi products without having to jump through hoops to stay in the clear KYC-wise.

We’ve already onboarded several financial institutions to the DeFi space, including Societé Generale (borrowing Dai against government-issued bonds), Nexo (offering our Vault solution to their platform’s users) - so we think a MakerDAO x AAVE collaboration for institutional clients is right on theme for both projects’ stance on institutional support.

Specification
Multi-Collateral Dai should be whitelisted for use on the Aave Arc Market. The address of the token on the Ethereum Main Network is 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f","['YES', 'NO']","[124187.27675544108, 0.10090101907995278]",1

AIP: TBD
Title: ARC - Add FOX Token (ShapeShift) as collateral
Status: Proposal
Authors: @valthedad @seven7hwave

SUMMARY

As explored in more detail below, listing FOX on Aave would provide an opportunity to earn additional fees as FOX holders collateralize their assets and increase platform liquidity. FOX is a token with a growing presence in the broader DeFi ecosystem, and is tied to an open-source platform that reduces friction and creates a better experience for crypto users.

BENEFITS FOR AAVE

Through the obvious mechanics, the addition of FOX to Aave would directly increase the platform’s usage and fees. The lending market for FOX is likely to increase over time; in addition to the aforementioned THORchain and Osmosis integrations, FOX is available on Rari Fuse. The Tokemak community also recently voted to give ShapeShift its own reactor, and in December 2021 the asset was added to Coinbase Pro. As such, it’s probable that demand for FOX in a borrowing-platform context will continue to grow in the months and years ahead.

FOX TOKEN BENEFITS

The roadmap for the ShapeShift DAO is ultimately driven by the community of FOX Token holders. Holding the token provides those holders with a number of benefits, including exposure to ShapeShift’s various value-accrual mechanisms:

- Revenue-sharing agreements with DeFi projects integrated into our platform, such as Yearn
- Revenues generated from commissions from validators operated on behalf of the DAO
- Revenues generated from allocating assets in the DAO’s treasury to DeFi strategies

Our newly-launched V2 platform is available at https://app.shapeshift.com. This version is open-source, supports multiple wallets, multiple blockchains (not limited to EVM-compatible networks), and is architected for complete decentralization.

The new ShapeShift, powered by a full open-source stack, will enable completely decentralized access to DeFi protocols across any chain. Additionally, the upcoming FOX Chain will provide backend node infrastructure for any interface that wants to be truly decentralized.

RISK MITIGATION

In July 2021 a comprehensive audit of Fox Token was undertaken by BlockchainLabs.NZ. The token’s smart contract has been live since 2019 and has a track record of bug-free interactions with the Ethereum blockchain. The token’s source code is viewable here: https://github.com/shapeshift/fox-token

# Simple Summary

The Aave V1, V2, and AMM market Reserve Factors (RF) on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield. The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aave’s metagovernance influence.

# Abstract

The Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer, Curve, and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities' tokenomic constructs. Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income, aToken yield derived from Aave V2, and governance token incentives in the form of BAL, CRV, CVX, stkAAVE and LDO.

The first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 13.4% and 4.6% respectively. The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80% or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees, stkAAVE, and BAL rewards. The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards, with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies.

The second investment theme is more complex. It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers (LPs). Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards, which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools.

The data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data.

# Motivation

## Part A - Consolidation

The legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~[$219M](https://app-v1.aave.com/home) of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time.

![|602x232](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqR-eDXg4N7SOqTj-zsEC)

This proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around ~[$821K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$27.45M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below:

![|602x232](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/947026c5031f95dbb5c76d9939f772d746867d90.png)

## Part B - Retain TVL & Increase Returns

Whilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most, if not all, treasuries to hold. The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens. Thus, Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence.

The two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals:

* Retain TVL within Aave
* Exceed aToken returns
* Accumulate metagovernance influence

In addition to these three goals, the Convex / Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens. aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider (LP) token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield.

The Compound pool on Curve has [$174.5M](https://curve.fi/compound/) of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has [$55.3M](https://curve.fi/aave/) of TVL.This is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool, 10.13% vAPY, relative to the Aave pool earning 7.58% vAPY on Convex.

# Specification

## Overview

Llama proposes diversifying $26,67M (94.36%) of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols: Convex, Curve and Balancer. The combined Aave V1, AMM, and V2 market RF totals [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) at the time of writing. A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) and a high-level overview is shown in the figure below.

The table below shows the assets that will be deployed within this proposal. Note this is only 94.4% of the assets and 5.6% of the assets are to remain unchanged within the Aave V2 RF.**

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c10a19f49f9edbbd241d7a280d0a0541e2bf9316.png)


The table above includes the following stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD and sUSD from the Aave V1 and V2 markets. The AMM markets holdings have not been included as they only total $119.3K at the time of writing.

The table below shows asset allocation per each strategy:

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/33eaba04a8080fdd0c5b6496090155a98965bab4.png)

The balance within the Aave V2 RF, not deployed in one of the above strategies is shown as Other (Longtailed Assets) in the figure below. The percentages reflect the overall composition of the RF, noting that 94.4% of the consolidated RF is deployed into one of the strabled detailed in the above table.

**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DLtTpPMVMYL0mhKSaCrroYwwD4r3-3uRDgwUjLIeZjrmMwnQ8i7-PSfgrwnHJLJnd5b4GfeTIhVuaW1emtWc12o-YFyQTqgVMOMyPni023sKbTxZFpyneBVCGu_eV3u-UuvOcsLc ""Chart"")**

The actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs. This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped / redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV.

The subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded.

## Convex / Curve Strategy

### Convex Allocation

The Convex (CVX) allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below:

**![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492da.png)**

In order to fund the initial $2M purchase of CVX, all of the AMPL, BUSD and TUSD will be used ($842.2K) and the balance, $1,16M, will be funded with USDC. This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of $43.20 is equivalent to about 46,300 CVX tokens.

We expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convex’s veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges. Based upon this [snapshot](https://vote.convexfinance.com/#/proposal/QmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp) and the [Voting Rules and Information](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/voting-and-gauge-weights) section of Convex’s documentation, we estimate around 70,000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate. This is expected to cost a further $1.02M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue. We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convex’s snapshot.

The assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed. Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments. However, we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading.

AMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions. Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap. The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap. Wherever possible, aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market.

The newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convex’s snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools. Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate.

The locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convex’s veCRV are distributed across Curve’s gauges. Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained.

### 4 Year Locked Curve (veCRV) Allocation

The aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV. This strategy is subject to Aave’s V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curve’s governance process.

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/21477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cf.png)

The veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges. Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior, these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge.

Subject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curve’s veCRV contract, the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV, then stake to earn CRV, CVX and 3crv, pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders. This is expected to generate 47.35% vAPY, see snippet below.

**![|602x244](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9G-SRpimpcuJqnZLX-OvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD)**

The earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time. The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aave’s voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV, then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time.

### Productive aToken Stable Strategy

The sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE, CVX and CRV rewards. The two strategies are expected to generate around 4.07% vAPY and 6.19% vAPY before Aave’s CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield.

The table below shows the allocation, how each strategy is funded, and which pool those funds are to be deposited into.

![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/03ca5c3d9bf70c960c6769e35b6a630d64b6ce18.png)

### Productive ETH Strategy

After transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF, the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool. The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV, CVX and LDO incentives. The expected yield is around 6.65% vAPY.

![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838.png)

No vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens.

## Balancer Strategy

### Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy

Balancer has recently launched the first [Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe?utm_source=website&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=aaveboostedpools) on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 13.4% vAPY at the time of writing. Using the [Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063) as a guide, we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining (LM) and even replace the Stable Pool in time.

The Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income, LM incentives, and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield. Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across. Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase.

The strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI, USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool. All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence.

AIP: TBD
Title: ARC - Add DPI as Collateral on the AAVE ARC market
Status: Proposal
Authors: @MatthewGraham @metfanmike @Mringz @3SEHoldings
Created: 03-02-2022

# Summary

This proposal aims to begin the onboarding process for listing DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) as collateral on the Aave ARC market.
# Abstract

DPI is the market leading DeFi themed indices product that presents investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to some of the largest DeFi names. The DPI token, an ERC20, is readily traded and has strong on-chain liquidity. DPI is currently supported by several large institutional investors making it readily accessible to large investors.

This proposal presents an opportunity for the Aave community to begin the onboarding process in working towards an Aave ARC listing. This will enable Aave to offer direct exposure to defi without needing to list several tokens and as we have seen from the Aave V2 Ethereum market listing there has been significant large investor demand for DPI.
# Motivation

On the 21st August 2021, Aave was the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform. The value of the DPI deposited into the Aave V2 Ethereum market quickly grew to over $60M. Furthermore, most of this $60M was supplied by a handful of addresses, which shows there is market appetite amongst investors to deposit indices like DPI on protocols like Aave ARC.

DPI is the market benchmark for DeFi and is becoming the investor grade standard for DeFi. Adding DPI would dramatically increase support to help make DeFi more readily accessible to more traditional investors via the KYC approved Aave ARC platform. Having already found strong support within the retail segment of the market with over [15,600](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1494ca1f11d487c2bbe4543e90080aeba4ba3c2b) holders. Index Coop believes listing DPI on Aave ARC as collateral with risk parameters in line with Aave V2 Ethereum market will be an ideal listing choice, offering exposure to many leading DeFi protocols through a single asset listing. Furthermore, being a basket of tokens, the volatility characteristics make DPI ideal for use as collateral.

# Rational

DPI is a basket of 13 popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum. The methodology behind DPI is from Scalara (formally Pulse, Inc), a subsidiary of DeFi Pulse. The criteria for token selection can be found [here](https://www.scalara.xyz/). DPI is the most popular DeFi index product with ~$100m AUM and over 15,600 holders.

DPI is built on top of Set Protocol and managed by Index Coop. Index Coop is a decentralized and autonomous asset manager governed, maintained, and upgraded by INDEX token holders.

Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

DPI would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem because it allows for a large pool of dormant capital (>$100m in non incentivized DPI AUM) to find a productive use. Additionally:

* Significant Borrow Demand: There is significant desire from whales to lend out the DeFi Pulse index and to use the DPI as collateral to borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).
* Low Volatility: Because indices are a basket of tokens, they represent less volatility than the component assets by themselves
* Efficient Sector Representation: Adding an index as collateral also gives exposure to all the component tokens while only having to add in a single token, thus saving gas in Aave’s system
* Liquidity via Primary and Secondary Markets: Minting and redeeming represent the primary market of the indices, but many users can buy and sell indices on the secondary markets - mostly Uniswap. The price on the secondary markets are kept at Net Asset Value (the market value of all the underlying components) through a network of market makers that redeem the tokens when price is below NAV and vice versa.

Additionally IndexCoop DAO is voting on a liquidity mining campaign to draw TVL to the Arc Market and give institutions a taste of the power of token incentives.

## DPI for Institutions

IndexCoop, the DAO issuer of DPI, has relationships with Fireblocks (a whitelister for the Aave ARC Market) as well as BitGo and Coinbase Custody to provide institutional custodial options, as well as deep liquidity through partnerships with market maker, and ARC market participant Wintermute.

Listing DPI will allow institutions to gain access to direct DeFi exposure without Aave ARC needing to list many tokens.

# Specification

DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) should be whitelisted for use on the Aave Arc Market. The address of the token on the Ethereum Main Network is 0x1494CA1F11D487c2bBe4543E90080AeBa4BA3C2b

# Simple Summary

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.

In addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.

# Abstract

Liquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.

* [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market

Continuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.

# Motivation

This proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.

The incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.

In addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:

1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)
2. Increase liquidity
3. Attractive (low) borrow rates
4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor
5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform

Within this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.

# Specification

The below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.

Key changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:

* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market
* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.

Note: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.

Option 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)

Option 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.

Asset Value Deposited Multiplier Daily stkAAVE Incentive LM Allocation (%) LM Incentive Split (%) LM vAPR (%)

Mathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)

# Rationale

The previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.

Aarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.

Aave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.

# Discussion

The previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)

With the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.

With the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.

## Economics

* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.
* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.
* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.
* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.
* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives
* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.

Further details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community. Please note, each query will need to be run separately.

# Simple Summary
We propose adjusting two (2) AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market: LTV and Liquidation Threshold.

# Abstract
This proposal updates two AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community. Index Coop has compiled the following analysis for Gauntlet and the broader Aave community to review.

# Motivation
Updating the AVAX parameters seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

# Specification
The criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the AVAX token on Avalanche network is presented below (data as of Jan. 23, 2021):

AVAX Avalanch Market Risk (Coingecko Data)

|Holders:|1.8 m|A|B+|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Transactions (C-chain)|79 m|B+|
|Mkt Cap|$15 bn|A+|
|Avg. Volume 1m|$860 m|B+|
|Avg. Volume 3m|$1.14 bn|B+|
|Norm. Volatility|6.21%|B-|

The AVAX token risk score compiled by Index Coop is B+.

Holders are estimated by the cumulative address count.

Market Cap is calculated using circulating supply.

The Norm. volatility parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.

AVAX Volatility Data (Coingecko Data)

|Time|S.D. of daily log returns|
| --- | --- |
|t=7 days|6.21%|
|t=30 days|5.54%|
|t= 90 days|6.88%|
|t= 180 days|7.80%|
|t= 365 days|8.81%|

|AVAX Loan to Value|50%|60%|
|AVAX Liquidation Threshold|65%|70%|

# Implementation
We are actively seeking feedback on how to implement this proposal. At this point in time an AIP vote could signal community intent/desire to change the requirements with the changes to be made by the guardians of the Aave Avalanche Market or via the AIP if a permissionless process is in place by that point in time.

Upgrade V2 to V3: This is currently not possible and puts Avalanche in the second cohort with respect to deploying Aave V3. This would provide better UX but also poses technical challenges.

Deploy V3: This would mean that there would be two markets, V2 and V3 and a migration would need to take place. Under this scenario, Aave V3 on Avalanche would happen sooner. 


Please see link to governance forum below. 

https://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-v3-on-avalanche/7045/4

Summary:

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on the Avalanche C-Chain.

Proposal:

On October 4, 2021, the Aave protocol was successfully deployed on the Avalanche C-Chain. This was made possible by the overwhelming support 5 received from the Aave community at the voting stage. The protocol launched in tandem with the Avalanche Rush 6 incentive program. The Avalanche Foundation allocated AVAX rewards to Aave users as part of Avalanche Rush, helping bring new users to the Aave ecosystem while also rewarding existing users. These initiatives supercharged the impressive growth of both Aave and Avalanche, with the Avalanche market quickly becoming Aave’s largest market after Ethereum.

The Avalanche C-Chain has evolved significantly since our last proposal and now hosts a mature and fast-growing DeFi ecosystem. Some highlights:

Users: The Avalanche C-Chain now has more than 1.5 million unique addresses and reached nearly 800k monthly active users 1 in December 2021.

TVL: More than 5 billion dollars has been bridged from Ethereum on the Avalanche Bridge, with the total TVL on the Avalanche C-Chain surpassing 10 billion dollars 1, making it the 4th largest blockchain by TVL.

Decentralisation: The Avalanche network remains as secure as ever and now counts more than 1,200 validators 1. Avalanche consensus allows it to easily scale to tens of thousands of validators.

Transaction volume: The Avalanche C-Chain routinely achieves more than 500k daily transactions, sometimes exceeding 1M daily transactions. This constitutes up to 80% 1 of the daily transaction volume on Ethereum.

Development activity: There are more than 16,000 1 cumulative unique smart contract deployers on the C-Chain and hundreds of dapps 2 live.

The deployment of Aave V3 on Avalanche will be mutually beneficial, allowing the protocol to tap into the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem and fulfill its multi-chain vision.

Deployment strategy:

The Avalanche Foundation will continue to incentivize Aave V3 through Avalanche Rush and focus on a safe migration from Aave V2 to V3.","['Upgrade V2 Market', 'Deploy V3 Market']","[243.1063433630397, 11535.273346470734]",0

aip: TBA
title: ARC - Enable Borrowing of DPI on Aave Markets
status: WIP
author: Index Coop - @MatthewGraham and @ncitron
created: 17-01-2021

# Simple Summary
Enable DPI to be borrowed on Aave markets.

# Abstract
Enable DPI to be borrowed on Aave markets.

In response to the Cream attack, AIP-44 was implemented disabling DPI along with xSUSHI borrowing as a precautionary safety measure whilst further analysis was performed.

Shortly after enacting AIP-44, DPI was found to be safe. Do note, DPI was not vulnerable to the same potential abuse as xSUSHI was and disabling borrowing was an initial reaction to ensure safety of user’s funds.

This proposal is to reinstate DPI as an asset that can be borrowed on the Aave markets.

# Motivation
At the time when AIP-44 was proposed, Index Coop knew that this attack was never possible for DPI. Index Coop fully supported temporarily suspending the borrowing market out of an abundance of caution.

xSUSHI is vulnerable because SUSHI can be donated to the xSUSHI contract to inflate its value. It is the ability for SUSHI to inflate the xSUSHI value that made the Cream exploit possible. For DPI, this same attack is not possible. This is because Index Coop has its own internal accounting system, which prevents the underlying components from being sent to the contract to inflate its price. The DPI Chainlink oracle uses this internal accounting system to calculate the value of DPI (sum of all parts), ensuring that the DPI price cannot be manipulated in any way.

For those that are interested the details attaining to the xSUSHI incident on CREAM can be found here and here.

With a deep understanding of the Cream exploit now widely understood within the broader ecosystem, Index Coop believes it is time to enable borrowing of DPI on the Aave V2 market.

# Specification
The recommendation is to enable borrowing and although there are a number of extrinsic use cases for DPI emerging, starting with a utilisation rate of 45%. For Variable Interest Rate parameters, a Base of 0, Slope 1 of 7% and Slope 2 of 300% was selected which is similar to the constituents within DPI. At this point in time, there is no ask for Stable Interest Rate borrowing.

The details outlining the original specification for listing DPI can be found here, AIP-31 2. For any additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi.

# Implementation
We recommend keeping the Collateral Risk Parameters as is and enabling Borrowing of DPI with the following Borrow Interest Rate Parameters.

# Risk Parameters:

LTV 65%
Liquidation Threshold 70%
Liquidation Bonus 8.5%
Reserve Factor 20%

Variable Interest Rate Parameters:

UOptimal 45%
R_0 0%
R_s1 7%
R_s2 300%

https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-deployment-to-bittorrent-chain-bttc/6813 

Summary

The BitTorrent DAO Community asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into BitTorrent Chain (known as BTTC), which can expand lending to the BitTorrent community and, with the provision of incentives, bootstrap the launch of Aave on a new ecosystem.

Proposer

BitTorrent Chain is an open-source, EVM-compatible blockchain that offers high concurrency, higher submission speed, lower transaction fees, and smoother operations. Since BTTC is fully-compatible with TRON, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, users are able to transfer mainstream assets among TRON, Ethereum, and BSC in a decentralized manner. Openness and accessibility are core values that we practice through our cross-chain strategy, and we find that aligns well with Aave goals.

We seek to support Aave in its multichain expansion and invite Aave to enable the Aave v2 front-end for BTTC. We believe that BTTC is ready-made to support Aave: BTTC offers a secure infrastructure (multi-node validation), heterogeneous cross-chain solution, faster transaction confirmation (PoS consensus mechanism with an average block time between 2-3 seconds) , and lower transaction fees (<$0.01 on average).

As the Layer 2 of TRON, BTTC inherits the advanced technology and resources from TRON, as well as $1.1bn TRON Ecosystem Fund. Since TRON’s MainNet release on May 31, 2018, TRON has risen to become the world’s fastest-growing public chain and the world’s largest network in terms of stablecoin settlement. Currently TRON boasts a staggering $70 billion worth of assets, over 66 million TRON accounts, and more than 39.9 billion TRC20-USDT in circulation on its network.

Moreover, BTTC integrates with Binance Smart Chain, which has one of the strongest deflationary mechanisms and currently has more daily active addresses than the rest of all layer 1s combined. That compatibility makes BTTC a better fit for DeFi applications like Aave.

We are convinced that BTTC is key to ushering in an era of connecting all chains, helping achieve rapid growth across the DeFi space, especially the Aave community.

Rationale

Current status of the BitTorrent Chain

BitTorrent Chain’s vision is to provide a high-performance, highly scalable, low-cost solution for blockchain platforms that delivers a superior user experience for decentralized applications without sacrificing decentralization while leveraging the existing developer ecosystem.

BTTC is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of consensus. As the first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol in the industry, users can transfer assets within TRON, Ethereum, BSC without any limits. The PoS consensus network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 2-3 seconds, making the network an incredible homecourt for DeFi and other EVM applications.

Why is it good for the Aave ecosystem?

BTTC is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, economic, and instant finality. The BitTorrent DAO Community has allocated up to $1bn for users of the Aave protocol. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established TRON community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on BTTC will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.

There is great potential for synergy between BTTC and Aave. As a close partner of TRON, BTTC will be able to contribute more than $1bn on Aave, and there are already more than $800mn assets of BTTC community on the Aave. The TRON DeFi ecosystem is thriving: Total Value Locked across TRON DeFi protocols is $5.39bn and growing. Many well-known protocols such as JustLend, Sunswap, amongst others, have deployed on TRON. On BTTC, Aave would find many users eager to participate in lending markets and add value to the Aave network.

Besides, as BTTC integrates more mainstream public chains like BSC, it will ease down the process of interacting between users and Aave, and that will definitely catapult the Aave ecosystem to the next level.

Why is signaling necessary?

Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, we believe that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on–and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. Deploying the Aave protocol on BTTC will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.
Proposal
Founded in 2019, Metis launched its Layer 2 mainnet on November 19, 2021. We are building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution with fast and cheap transactions; no-code integration via a middleware layer powered by smart contract templates; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) infrastructure enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain, with all the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.
A mere eight weeks after launching Andromeda mainnet, Metis TVL surpassed the majority of its competitors, surging to the #3 spot as measured by L2Beat and reaching $500M+ TVL. As the fastest growing L2, Metis has taken the blockchain world by storm with its Optimistic Rollup technology, EVM-Equivalence, and incredible mutually-incentivized ecosystem. With a robust and secure infrastructure, a self-deployed Graph node, multiple oracle providers, on-chain explorers, and a dedicated integrations team ready to assist throughout every step of the porting process, Metis is ready for Aave integration.
Metis envisions and supports a multichain future and seeks to invite Aave to expand its own mission of creating a multichain future, by having Aave enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aave’s multichain expansion. As well, there are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from.
Metis’ commitment to a decentralized future is built into its very structure, including the ethos of creating a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem where its partners are set up to thrive. This is best exemplified by Metis’ Builder Mining Program. This program allows all DApps deployed on Andromeda to directly participate in the revenue Metis generates. For example: if Aave deployed on Andromeda, 30% of the fees accrued from every single transaction occurring through Aave would be kicked back directly back to Aave, in perpetuity.
The mission at Metis is to provide the infrastructure and incentive system to make deployment on our network a no-brainer. This additional revenue will be going to the Aave DAO’s treasury and as such, will be able to be utilized as seen fit by the Aave community at large.
Metis also has some of the fastest transactions in blockchain, often executing faster than your web browser can process them, and always executing faster than MetaMask can record them. Transactions on our Layer 2 network currently cost about $2-$3, considerably less than the gas fees on Layer 1 Ethereum. Metis will launch its own storage layer by the end of Q1 2022, which will enable cheap, secure storage of NFTs and other large blocks of data, while doubling as an additional scalability layer; as a result, transaction fees will drop to just cents by the end of Q1 2022.
The traction earned by our popular DeFi protocols are great case studies to the adoption and eagerness of the Metis community to engage with our DeFi ecosystem. Netswap, the first ever native Layer 2 DEX, surpassed $1B in trading volume in its first month of operation. Likewise, popular yield optimization protocols Beefy Finance and Pickle Finance have achieved great success since integrating and launching their protocols on Andromeda.
Metis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We are considering the options of qualifying airdrops for interaction with the protocol on Andromeda and building Reputation Power (allowing for future whitelisting opportunities) for Aave holders voting on this proposal. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network.
Metis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.

SEBA submits a proposal to Aave Governance for adding SEBA Bank as a “Whitelister” to Aave Arc.

SEBA is a licensed and supervised Swiss Bank providing a seamless and secure bridge between digital and traditional assets. SEBA serves professional and institutional clients which include top-tier private banks, asset managers and crypto companies. The interest of SEBA’s clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime. Initially lending crypto and staking with SEBA, those investors are now showing significant interest for accessing yields in DeFi protocols. Due to various regulatory restrictions in their jurisdictions, SEBA’s institutional clientele has not been able deploy liquidities at large scale in Aave until now. The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations. At SEBA, we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues. 

The Aave Governance will review and approve Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants. As a Swiss digital asset bank, we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc.

## About SEBA Bank
Founded in April 2018 and headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, SEBA Bank is a pioneer in the banking industry with the mission to build a regulated and progressive technological bridge between the traditional and the crypto worlds. With a FINMA banking and securities dealer license, SEBA Bank closes an important gap between the new digital economy and traditional banking. SEBA Bank enables professional individuals and companies as well as institutional clients to invest, custody, trade, stake, lend and borrow digital and traditional assets, all in one place. 

What SEBA brings to the Aave Arc community:

*	A fully regulated digital assets bank that embraces innovation
*	With a large institutional client base in demand for exploring new opportunities in DeFi
*	And with a banking-grade platform to securely bridge liquidities in Aave ARC

Paragraph Summary

Our goal is to accelerate Aave's expansion in the multi-chain world. Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts.

Boba Network invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v3
front-end for Boba markets, and adding Boba Network in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.

Introducing Boba's WAGMI incentive program for builders and developers, in collaboration with UMAprotocol, we will be distributing WAGMI options on $BOBA tokens to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Boba Network.

WAGMI options are KPI (key performance indicators) options based on metrics relating to Boba Network, such as monthly active wallets or project specific TVL. Traditional liquidity mining programs are zero-sum: users come to collect high rewards and are incentivized to keep those rewards. WAGMI farming turns this model on its head by being positive sum: users are incentivized to evangelize and encourage behaviors that grow Boba.

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support.

Our overall goal is to use Boba’s $100 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 1,000 dapps and 1mm+ daily transactions.

Motivation

Aave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Boba ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Oolongswap, FRAX, Synapse, Dodo and many other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Boba and will add net new users from Boba’s 300,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs and NFT marketplaces, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Boba.

Specifications

Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts. Boba offers fast exits backed by community-driven liquidity pools, shrinking the Optimistic Rollup exit period from seven days to only a few minutes, while giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.

Boba’s extensible smart contracts will enable developers across the Ethereum ecosystem to build dApps that invoke code executed on web-scale infrastructure such as AWS Lambda, making it possible to use algorithms that are either too expensive or impossible to execute on-chain.

Boba Network aspires to be the People’s L2 that puts users and developers first. The goal is to build a pragmatic L2 that is the first step towards opening Ethereum to the next Billion users. Boba is an L2 Ethereum scaling & augmenting solution built by the Enya team as core contributors to the OMG Foundation.

Boba has grown to ~$350mm in TVL on mainnet since launch and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible.

HAL makes it simple to monitor and build automated workflows based on real-time blockchain data. Our mission is to ""glue"" together centralised and decentralised technologies (https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-gluing-manifesto-159cabef0532) to help the ecosystem strive. By leveraging push notifications, DAOs can increase user engagements and provide additional value to their members.

This proposal looks to embed the HAL notification system into the Aave UI.

### Motivation

Given the market volatility, it is critical for Aave's lenders and borrowers to carefully monitor their positions to prevent liquidation. HAL's Aave recipes (https://9000.hal.xyz/aave) are already used by thousands of users for risk management.

Adding HAL into the Aave UI will unlock additional level of protocol engagement and security for all Aave users.

### Benefits for the Aave community

The integration would allow all AAVE users to be notified about the status of their Health Factor. Using our recipe, AAVE users can be notified in real time on the health factor conditions of their position, thus greatly reducing the risk of being liquidated.

Moreover, this integration increases the trust within the AAVE community, allowing anyone to have access to information on the health factor in a straightforward form and with the possibility of receiving a notification via Email, Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Slack and Webhook. We already witnessed a similar positive feedback loop in the past when we did a similar integration with Bancor (https://twitter.com/HAL_Team/status/1389945442818011140).

# ARC: Add ENS as collateral

## Summary

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is an critical piece of infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem with over 400,000 names registered and hundreds of intergrations across the ecosystem.

$ENS is the governance token providing ownership over the ENS protocol. $ENS governs the direction of the ENS treasury as well as controlling crucial protocol parameters via the ENS registrar controller.

This proposal looks to onboard $ENS as a collateral asset to Aave. 

## Motivation

Following conversations with Aave and ENS core team members, we've found that ENS is a prime candidate for Aave, already having gathered over $1B in circulating market cap and millions of dollars in liquidity across the ecosystem.

The addition of ENS to Aave lending markets will unlock additional liquidity and optionality for all ENS holders.

## Benefits to Aave Community

ENS is a highly reputable multi-billion dollar protocol with a significant amount of liquidity on Ethereum. The addition of ENS will provide Aave with an increase in bandwidth and utility for the protocol.

In addition, the Aave community should be aligned with the addition of ENS token given a significant amount of the Aave community also hold ENS names (and ENS tokens as a result of the retroactive distribution).

title: Aave V2 - Liquidity Mining Program (90 days at 30% reduced rate)
status: Proposal
author: @MatthewGraham
created: 2021-10 25

# Simple Summary
Liquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2on the 26th April 2021 via AIP-16 6 and then voted to continue on the 24th August 2021 via AIP-32 2 for an additional 90 days. AIP-32 incentives are due to expire 22nd November 2021.

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives for an additional 90 days from when AIP-32 2 finishes, up to including the 20th February 2021. The incentives will be distributed at a 30% reduced rate, commencing the tapering of incentives on the Aave V2 market.

Stable coin / low vol assets receive lending and borrowing incentives, split 1:2, in favour of borrowers over lenders. Aave V2’s revenue is derived from interest paid by borrowers and borrowing demand drives lending yield through higher liquidity utilisation. High vol assets receive lending incentives, skewed towards assets more recently listed and communities that have static relationships with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.

# Abstract
The intent is to recognise liquidity mining incentives played a large role in helping grow Aave V2 TVL, whilst being conscious that competitors continue to offer incentives APRs marginally exceeding what Aave is currently offering.

When incentives were reduced aggressively on the Polygon market, the daily revenue reduced significantly. There is a risk that by tapering liquidity mining incentives on Aave V2 too aggressively could trigger the same outcome as what was experienced on the Polygon market.

* AIP-16 6: 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th April 2021
* AIP-32 2: 2,200 stkAAVE per day 2 from 24th August 2021
* AIP-XY: 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd November 2021

Based on the learnings from the Polygon market and reviewing the governance forum, this proposal reduces Liquidity Mining rewards by 30% over the next 90 days. For the following 90 days during 2022, the logic would be to continue further reducing incentives pending how the market reacts to the implementation of this proposal.

It is to the benefit of the protocol to incentivise borrows more than depositors. Conceptually, incentivizing borrows already increases deposit rates, so passive depositors still benefit significantly.

To encourage the depositing of high volatility assets, this proposal suggests incentivising the lending of newly listed assets and continuing to offer incentives on those that are strategically important for the Aave community. Offering incentives on newly listed assets is expected to kickstart the supply of liquidity.

# Motivation
As a community member, liquidity mining has been great for bringing more users as stakeholders for the Aave Protocol and distributing the governance power to a wider more decentralised group of holders. Distributing stkAAVE means users also backstoppers of the protocol and automatically have skin in the game.

I would say that most liquidity that a liquidity protocol such as the Aave Protocol needs is stablecoins - incentivised as diversely as possible and also encouraging stablecoins that are aiming towards decentralization such as RAI, FEI and FRAX.

I would like to present to the community an opportunity to continue distributing stkAAVE at the same rate per day across the Aave V2 market with the intention of achieving the following:

* Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)
* Increase liquidity
* Attractive (low) borrow rates
* Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor
* Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform

As the value deposited within the Aave V2 market has grown from ~$5B to ~$21B and the $AAVE price has underperformed this growth, the incentive APR is lower now relative to the start of the prior incentive period.

On the 17th June 2021, the incentives on Polygon were reduced by 5x and revenue fell from $55.77K per day to $32.27K per day. This highlights the risk of reducing incentives to hastily. It is worth noting Compound is providing liquidity mining rewards similar to the existing 2,200 stkAAVE distribution level in terms of APR across key stable coin (low vol asset) markets.

author: @MatthewGraham @afromac
created: 04/11/2021

ARC: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-polygon-market-wmatic-risk-parameter-changes/6021

## Simple Summary
We propose adjusting two (2) MATIC risk parameters on the Aave Polygon Market: LTV and Liquidation Threshold.

## Abstract
This proposal updates two MATIC risk parameters on the Aave Polygon Market to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community. Index Coop has compiled the following analysis for Gauntlet and the broader Aave community to review.

## Motivation
Updating the MATIC parameters seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

## Specification
The criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the MATIC token on Polygon network is presented below:

wMATIC Polygon Market Risk (Polygon Network Data)

Holders:	168,102	B+ to A-	B+
Transactions	100,240,631	A	
Mkt Cap	586,568,252	B+ to A-	
Av. Vol.	$50,675,854	C+ to B-	
Norm. Vol	0.06579	C+ to B-	

The MATIC token risk score compiled by Index Coop is B+. This matches the risk score cited here 1. However, the volatility score of B- (C+ to B-) is justified by the 0.06579 score compared to 0.064 in the table presented in the documentation 1. Further to this, assets like BAL and BAT on Ethereum have similar vol characteristics to wMATIC on Polygon. The Norm. Vol parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.

wMATIC Volatility Data (Polygon Network Data)

Time	S.D Vol
t=7 days	0.08475
t=30 days	0.06535
t= 90 days	0.06622
t= 180 days	0.09013
t= 365 days	NA

Based upon the volatility data share above, Index Coop suggests changing the Liquidation Threshold and Loan to Value parameters as shown below:

Parameter	Current Value	Recommended Value
wMATIC Liquidation Threshold	65%	70%
wMATIC Loan to Value	50%	65%

## Implementation
We are actively seeking feedback on how to implement this proposal. At this point in time an AIP vote could signal community intent/desire to change the requirements with the changes to be made by the guardians of the Aave Polygon Market or via the AIP if a permissionless process is in place by that point in time.

shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for UST
ARC discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-support-for-terra-usd-ust/6003
created: 2021-11-09
updated: N/A
---

## Simple Summary

TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin issued on the Terra blockchain. Its market capitalization has grown to [almost $2.8B](​https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-usd​) since its inception on October 1. UST is designed such that each UST can be redeemed for $1 of LUNA, and vice versa. This has kept the price close to the peg, which is essential for a stablecoin.

## Motivation

Terra is committed to a multi-chain strategy and as such are motivated to find vibrant borrowing/lending markets for UST on all of the chains where UST is supported. Ethereum continues to be the top destination for assets from the Terra ecosystem.

UST is supported by major dApps including Curve, Uniswap, Sushi, Harvest, etc. UST can also be deposited into Mirror Protocol mAsset pools on Uniswap, and is depositable into Anchor via [EthAnchor](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/developers-ethereum/ethanchor). We believe there will be sufficient demand for borrowing/lending given the variety of existing use cases.

Finally, as referenced earlier, Terra has begun its migration from its centrally held bridge to [Wormhole](https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto). This move should lower the centralization risks associated with UST while increasing its adoption case as it reaches more chains via Wormhole in the future.

## Proposed Parameters

UST will be used both as collateral and for borrowing. We proposed the same parameters used for DAI:

```typescript
export const strategyUST: IReserveParams = {
  optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.8).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  baseVariableBorrowRate: new BigNumber(0).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.04).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  stableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.02).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  stableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  baseLTVAsCollateral: '7500',
  liquidationThreshold: '8000',
  liquidationBonus: '10500',
  borrowingEnabled: true,
  stableBorrowRateEnabled: true,
  reserveDecimals: '18',

V1 of the Aave Protocol provided a way for users to provide and obtain liquidity autonomously, and to earn yield on any liquidity provided to the protocol.   

In December 2020, a second version of the Aave Protocol was deployed, which brought new features to liquidity provision and liquidity access in the DeFi ecosystem. V2 of the Aave Protocol featured, among other things, credit delegation, the ability for users to choose between stable and variable interest rates on any borrow transaction and certain gas optimizations and improvements.   

Around the same time, Aave Governance gained administration and maintenance over V1 and V2 of the Aave Protocol, and were tasked with the continued growth of the ecosystem around the Aave Protocol (the “Aave Ecosystem”). 

The Aave Ecosystem has grown organically over the past two years, supporting successful, safe and risk conscious operation of the Aave Protocol.  The community has supported the Aave Protocol’s expansion from the Ethereum mainnet to the Polygon and Avalanche networks as well. 

After these two years of substantial growth, this snapshot proposal to the Aave Governance seeks community approval for a new iteration of the Aave Protocol: Introducing Aave V3. 👻 🎉 

The features associated with Aave V3 represent a significant technological advancement from DeFi liquidity protocols as we know them today. 

Aave V3 introduces the following features (among others):  

- Portal: allows assets to seamlessly flow between Aave V3 markets over different networks; 

- High Efficiency Mode: allows borrowers to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral;  

- Isolation Mode: limits exposure and risks to the protocol from newly listed assets by only permitting borrowing up to a specific debt ceiling;  

- Risk Management Improvements: provides additional protection for the protocol through various risk caps and other tools;  

-  L2-Specific Features: designs specific to Layer 2 networks to improve user experience and reliability;  

-  Community Contribution: facilitates and incentivizes community usage through a modular, well organized codebase. 

These features make V3 the most robust and efficient DeFi liquidity protocol ever designed. 

In the event that the community votes affirmatively, the Aave Protocol V3 codebase audits being conducted by OpenZeppelin, Trail Of Bits, Peckshield, ABDK and Certora will be completed in or around the end of November. In addition, certain auditors may apply to the DAO to conduct additional audits of the code upon release before deployment. 

If the community votes positively for deployment of V3 of the Aave Protocol, there will be a set of additional Snapshot votes for the community to determine the following: 

- Deployment Networks:  Given the proliferation of efficient networks, including L2s, the community can vote on which networks V3 will be released initially.  V3 will be able to be deployed on a maximum of three networks upon release, so the Snapshot will be a “ranking” vote. 

- The V3 code licensing: In light of the fact that the Aave Ecosystem is highly diffuse and decentralized, Aave Governance will decide what type of license, if any, will apply to the Aave Protocol V3 code.  As far as we are aware, this is a first for the DeFi space! 

- The V3 Bug Bounty program: The community will decide on size, duration and scope of the Bug Bounty program, as well as who (e.g., the RiskDAO, etc. – see proposal here [insert RiskDAO governane proposal]) will administer the program. 

- Retroactive funding:  The community will also be able to decide whether to provide retroactive funding to those who contributed to the creation of V3, and how much funding to provide.   

If the community votes to deploy V3, another ARC will provide additional details relating to each of the additional votes described above. 

Once these votes determine the community decisions and the current audits are finalized, the deployments voted upon by the community can begin.

**Summary:** 

Llama proposed an [initial treasury strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-initial-treasury-strategy/5602) to productively deploy Aave’s treasury. This Snapshot proposal is a follow-up to request the Aave community’s feedback on whether we should implement Aave treasury strategies on sidechains or on mainnet only. The pros and cons of both options are outlined below.

**Background**

Most of the Aave’s treasury is on Ethereum mainnet. The mainnet treasury is split between Aave V1 and Aave V2 + AMM market.

-   Aave V1 reserve factor: 0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae ($865K)
-   Aave V2 + AMM reserve factor: 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c ($20.9M)

But Aave’s treasury on other chains is growing too:
-   Aave Polygon RF: 0x7734280a4337f37fbf4651073db7c28c80b339e9 ($7.1M)
-   Aave Avalanche RF: 0x467b92af281d14cb6809913ad016a607b5ba8a36 ($660K)

This proposal solicits community feedback in order to propose strategies that fit Aave DAO’s preferences.

**Option 1: Build a strategy on each chain**

*Benefits:*
-   Avoid rebalancing the treasury
-   Allow the DAO to diversify the yield
-   Diversify the risk with several protocols
-   Reduce gas costs

*Drawbacks:*
-   Sidechain security is lower than mainnet security
-   More protocols can increase the risk
-   Implementation is complicated with several AIPs

**Option 2: Group all the reserve factor together and focus on mainnet strategies:**

*Benefits:*

-   Easier implementation (less strategies, less AIPs)
-   Mainnet security

*Drawbacks:*

-   Higher gas costs
-   Need to rebalance all RFs to Aave V2 periodically
-   Less yield opportunities

The goal of this poll is to know if the community would like to start implementing Aave strategies on each chain or on mainnet only.

If the community votes for Option 1, we will build strategies on each chain - Polygon and Avalanche today. Aave need not keep assets on sidechains in perpetuity. If there is a better yield opportunity on mainnet, Aave would still be able to bridge funds on mainnet.

However, if Option 2 is voted, Llama should focus on building strategies on mainnet only.

ARC discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793/6
created: 2021-10-18

## Simple Summary

Lido allows users to earn staking rewards on the Ethereum beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure. This is done through the stETH token. stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit and can be held, traded, or sold.

Full ARC and discussion can be viewed here: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793

Proposed voting choices:
1. Yes: Add stETH as proposed (no borrowing)
2. No: Do not add stETH

## Abstract

There is strong interest in using stETH to earn additional yield without taking a lot of risk. This is evident through the growth of the stETH/ETH pool on Curve Finance, which has become the most liquid pool on Curve with a liquidity of $3.8 billion.

The addition of stETH on to Aave can work to attract a larger audience to both Aave and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to Aave as market participants look to borrow against their staked ETH or lend their stETH for a yield.

We want people who want to be responsibly long ETH (i.e. via taking leverage on AAVE) to be able to put some extra staking rewards on top.

## Motivation

stETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons:

- stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;
- stETH is a productive asset. Earning rewards on collateral effectively lowers the cost of borrowing. This could make borrowing more attractive on Aave and help to increase market utilization (and therefore Aave’s protocol revenue from stablecoin reserve factors).
- stETH is a very liquid asset with over $3.8 billion in liquidity locked in the Curve stETH/ETH pool.

## Proposed Risk Parameters
These have been modified since the last proposal. The reasons are described below. Generally, the functions of stETH have held consistent during growth and market volatility.

LTV: 70%
Liquidation Threshold: 75%
Liquidation Bonus: 7.5%
Reserve Factor: 10%

A LTV of 70% is higher than the 56% average LTV across non-stablecoin assets and 10% lower than ETH’s 80% LTV. This gives the protocol more room to safely liquidate stETH with a volatility profile similar to ETH.

Interest Rate Model (we plan to not have stETH borrowing available initially):

UOptimal: 60%
Base: 0%
Slope 1: 8%
Slope 2: 200%

As stETH is more suited as collateral instead of a borrowing asset we adjusted the utilization rate to 60% and doubled slope 2 in order to safe guard enough liquidity in the event of market consolidation and liquidation events.

stETH liquidity and risk considerations

- stETH inherits all of ETH’s market risk, so they should be considered together for the purpose of evaluating market risk
- stETH value is defined and backed by the value of Ether and expectations on the beacon chain withdrawals timeline. As the expected merge gets closer, stETH risk will drop down significantly.
- stETH is one of the most liquid tokens in crypto with low exchange volumes and extremely high liquidity
- stETH liquidity is ensured by Lido’s strategy incentivizing a consistent stETH peg

52,QmcgTovk982fcUTN17qtDyZ4oCoVGnKZJGuwMVtqspfphk,Should Aave add the audited claimRewardsToSelf function to the liquidity mining incentives contract?,"
**Summary**
Aave incentive contracts currently only contain claiming functions in which the caller specifies the recipient to address, who will receive the claimed rewards. Unfortunately, this poses a security problem for abstractly-designed smart contract claimants that do not have fully-trusted originators of claiming txs. This is the case for Enzyme vaults.
By adding an additional claiming function to the incentive contract that uses msg.sender instead of to, the tx originator no longer needs to be trusted.
This simple addition - that can reuse the exact same claiming logic as the current claiming functions and will not require any changes to storage layout - will increase composability opportunities with Enzyme and similarly architected protocols.


**Background**
Enzyme is a decentralised asset management infrastructure built on Ethereum. It allows asset managers to build on-chain investment Vaults that utilise and allocate to the newest innovations in DeFi. Because all transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, compliance, accounting, and investor management services are rendered programatically and at a dramatically-reduced cost to their traditional finance counterparts.
Amongst other things, Enzyme Vaults can interact with AAVE by lending. We are currently also working on accommodating the borrowing functionality to enable leveraged strategies as part of our Sulu release this quarter.
In order to keep providing our users with superior asset management tools in DeFi, we want to open up the liquidity mining option for them as soon as possible. Our users rely on having the latest DeFi functionality in Enzyme to reach their full potential.


**Proposal**
Add function claimRewardsToSelf(address[] calldata assets, uint256 amount) to the liquidity mining incentives contract, which reuses the logic of claimRewards() but uses msg.sender instead of to


**Benefits for AAVE**
- Increased AAVE adoption by the Enzyme user base and other similarly architected protocols
- Tapping into a new and fast-growing community
- A closer collaboration between our two projects & communities
- Enzyme contracts have been audited by PWC, Chain Security and some of the leading auditors in the space who sit on the Enzyme Council
- Opening up the possibility for new and novel use-cases to be built around AAVE

## Summary
Aave Arc is a “permissioned” version of the software underlying V2 of the Aave protocol that employs an additional smart contract layer to only allow “whitelisted” or “permissioned” users to engage with the protocol.

Fireblocks asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, as a “whitelister” for one or more deployments of Aave Arc.

## Proposal
Fireblocks is on a mission to bring more institutional participants into DeFi.

Today, Fireblocks serves more than 600 customers and has secured over $1.25 trillion in digital assets. Fireblocks’ technology has become trusted by the leading institutional crypto players and the world’s biggest banks to secure digital assets, develop new yield generating strategies, and improve capital efficiency. As the initial whitelisting partner for Aave Arc, Fireblocks can offer institutions the same secure and scalable rails used to transfer and store digital assets to access permissioned DeFi environments.

DeFi is considered by institutional users to be one of the more complex markets to navigate across security, compliance, and risk perspectives. We are eager to be at the forefront of this transformational opportunity with Aave Arc by extending access to even our most compliance-conscious customers, who would otherwise avoid DeFi over compliance or regulatory concerns.

Fireblocks’ R&D, compliance, and legal teams have developed a new whitelister framework for permissioned DeFi. This framework meets both enterprise-grade requirements for accessing DeFi and adheres to Aave Arc’s whitelister governance criteria. This deployment will set the precedent for new organizations joining Aave Arc, simplify the process for onboarding new whitelisters, and ensure everyone is following best practices defined by the whitelister community.

Avalanche: Signal for deployment

Summary

The Avalanche Foundation asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into Avalanche.

Proposer

The Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting the Avalanche ecosystem and related technologies. The Foundation is part of a larger Avalanche ecosystem and working with other organizations to support the significant development of Avalanche-related technologies.

Avalanche is one of the fastest smart contracts platforms in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality, and has the most validators securing its activity of any proof-of-stake protocol. Avalanche’s C-Chain is an instance of the EVM running with Avalanche’s consensus.

Rationale

Current status of the Avalanche C-Chain: The Avalanche network is secured by over 1,000 validators and is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of Avalanche consensus. While maintaining this level of decentralization, the network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 1-2 seconds, making the network’s C-Chain an incredible playground for DeFi and other EVM applications. The ecosystem already has a slew of native projects offering exchange, lending, and aggregation services, over $1.5bn bridged from Ethereum, over $2.2bn in TVL, and protocols such as SushiSwap and Curve deployed or in the process of deploying.

Why it is good for the Aave ecosystem: The Avalanche blockchain is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, and near-instant finality. Through the Avalanche Rush program, the Avalanche foundation has allocated up to $20M AVAX for users of the Aave protocol over a three-month period to earn AVAX rewards while using Aave on Avalanche for the first phase of the program. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established Avalanche community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on established chains like Avalanche will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.

Why signaling is necessary? Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, he Avalanche Foundation believes that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on – and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. The Avalanche Rush announcement received a lot of interest from both the Aave and Avalanche communities. Deploying the Aave protocol on Avalanche will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.

Next Steps

Creation of Snapshot vote for the Aave community to signal YES/NO for deployment on Avalanche.

57,QmYYBedL9aRFdC5DUgjN3QMoYxvJhAUBb2sEyhFuVQZbLG,Launch Aave on Harmony,"Harmony is proposing to deploy Aave v2 on the Harmony blockchain to expand lending to a growing community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Aave to a new ecosystem. 

Paragraph Summary

Our goal is to accelerate Aave's expansion in the multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees. 

Harmony invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v2 front-end for Harmony markets, and adding Harmony in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.  

Harmony will start by providing $5M USD in ONE tokens in incentives to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Harmony. 

We specifically planned for a one year incentive campaign so that net new users have the opportunity to come into Aave and decentralized finance. We know that many protocols are giving out even higher incentives over a short period of time. We chose an attractive incentive over a longer period so that new users who may not be experienced power users can also benefit from the launch. 

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support. 

Our overall goal is to use Harmony’s $300 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 10,000 builders and 10 million users. 

Motivation

Aave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Harmony. 

Specifications

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 120M transactions on mainnet and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum, Binance and 3 other chains.

title: Add FRAX to Aave V2
status: Proposed
author: Jason Huan (@jasonhuan_)
shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FRAX stablecoin
discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-frax/2621
created: 2021-08-25
---

## Simple Summary

Frax is the first algorithmic-stablecoin protocol, backed through on-chain collateral and algorithmically. Frax has two tokens, the FRAX stablecoin pegged at $1 and the FXS governance + seigniorage token, and aims to be a decentralized crypto-native unit of account with the upcoming Frax Price Index (FPI). FRAX has stayed at $1 for its entire existence, being the only non-traditional stablecoin to keep its peg perfectly in 8 months of release.

## Abstract

The FRAX stablecoin is partially backed with on-chain collateral and partially backed algorithmically, according to a collateral ratio (CR) parameter that the system adjusts according to market conditions. In Frax v2, the protocol is able to mint FRAX into lending markets using [Algorithmic Market Operations](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview) (AMOs), smart contracts which have the ability to print FRAX up to certain thresholds adjustable by governance.

## Motivation

As the value of Aave's TVL increases, borrow liquidity for stablecoins against volatile assets lent to Aave is one of the key benefits that is offered to lenders of the protocol. The flow of newly minted stablecoins to their decentralized lending market destination such as Aave is not always direct, and may face market inefficiencies through layers of actors.

By [deploying an AMO for Aave](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/frax-lending), the Frax protocol is able to mint FRAX to be borrowed by lenders of Aave, and thus offer an active and competitive alternative to other stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, and DAI. By allowing for responsive stablecoin liquidity, we aim to benefit lenders and the Aave ecosystem as a whole.

Additionally, With no collateral factor, there is 0 risk for Aave's money market in terms of the FRAX peg. Furthermore, if the FRAX peg broke and fell below $1, Aave borrowers would have less debt in dollar terms.

## Specification

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

	- Co-founder of Frax.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

	- FRAX is the world's first fractionally-algorithmic stablecoin, stabilized with parts on-chain collateral and parts algorithmically.

3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

	- Frax's AMOs are able to mint FRAX into the Aave lending market, allowing for highly competitive stablecoin borrowing rates for lenders.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

	- FRAX launched at the end of 2020 and currently has over $300M in circulating FRAX. FRAX has never once broken the peg of $1, even through sharp market downturns such as in March 2021. Frax's governance token FXS has maintained governance functionality since inception through a fork of Compound's GovernorAlpha.

5. How is the asset currently used?

	- FRAX is currently used as a stablecoin in decentralized exchanges and other lending markets such as Rari's Fuse Protocol, where it is currently the most-borrowed and most-supplied stablecoin in several pools through Frax's AMOs.

6. Emission schedule

	- There is no emission schedule; FRAX is mintable by anyone anytime by depositing corresponding amounts of collateral and FXS into the system's contracts.

7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

	- The protocol is highly modular in terms of system parameters such as oracle addresses and AMO additions. The core contracts such as the token contract itself are non-proxy deployed and permissioned through governance's 2-day timelock, with a backup multisig admin address managed by the core Frax team.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

    - Market Cap: $307M
    - 24h Volume: $15M
    - Volatility: Extremely Low
    - Maturity: Early-Mid

9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)

	- 13K followers on Twitter, 6.2K members on Telegram, Github is updated frequently.

10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens

    - Date of Deployment: December 20th, 2020
    - Number of Transactions: 110,000+
    - Number of Holders: 1,600+

## Rationale

Frax's design rationale came as a synthesis of a crypto-native stablecoin with capital efficiency, allowing it to perform algorithmic market operations while managed by on on-chain DAO. As Frax expands, it can compound on its own network effects by being a highly liquid routing asset on DEXes and a default borrowing option for many lending market pools. To keep decentralization at the forefront, the USDC collateral is spread out through other lending markets and DEXes, and is planned to be rotated to ETH and ETH-equivalent collateral as the protocol matures. Furthermore, the Frax Price Index (FPI) allows for a shift away from the USD unit-of-account into the first major stable crypto-native unit-of-account.

## Implementation

The FRAX price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FRAX/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).

FRAX will only be used for depositing and lending and not as collateral, with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) value of 0%. The other parameters are as such:


  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo
  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0
  - Liquidation Threshold: 0
  - Liquidation Bonus: 0
  - Borrowing Enabled: true
  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false
  - Reserve Decimals: 18
  - Reserve Factor: 1000

Following the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:

- Interest bearing aFRAX address: 0x4ca44E16DAbcdB5a770eA623aca3adCcCde6fBb3
- Variable Debt variableDebtFRAX address: 0x861CbFc3e727d2CF2F0af964395e447C28d4967e

[CertiK Audit](https://www.certik.org/projects/fraxfinance)

**Note that the risk assessment was performed in May 2021, when FRAX's market cap was $110M**

**FRAX Smart Contract Risk**: **C**

Frax has been live on the Ethereum mainnet for over 8 months.

**FRAX Counterparty Risk**: **C+**

Currently the Frax protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol is meant to be governance minimized with a gradual transition to DAO + comptrollers.

**FRAX Market Risk**: **B**

The current FRAX market cap is over $307,000,000 USD. The average 24H trading volume in the past month has been over $14,000,000 USD. FRAX's volatility is negligible on Curve and Uniswap v3.

**FRAX Overall Risk**: **B-**

59,Qmb6WGr1ZEvTghKpYcCrrztuLjAXC9saY6o8bTbAiiSCMK,Aave Centrifuge Permissioned “RWA” Market Proposal,"## Rationale: 
END_Bridge with the support of Centrifuge is proposing to add a Real World Assets (""RWA"") permissioned market on Aave. 

## References: 
Following on from the ARC Proposal and discussions in the forum (link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-centrifuge-permissioned-rwa-market-proposal/4620))

## Overview:
Our goal is to launch the first (permissioned) market for Real World Assets (RWA) on the Aave protocol. This will allow Aave depositors to earn yield against stable, uncorrelated real world collateral while Centrifuge asset originators can borrow money from Aave, automatically balance capital needs and provide an alternative collateral to volatile crypto assets. Currently, [pools](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/) on the Tinlake protocol range from real estate, to supply chain financings, to music streaming invoices. 

The permissioned RWA market will be operated and managed by END_Bridge via an independent and bankruptcy remote limited liability company. Independent means that END_Bridge is not owned, not operated by, and not managed by Centrifuge or one of the existing Issuers of RWA pools on Tinlake. 

Centrifuge is the infrastructure provider that enables asset originators to create an on-chain asset fund via Tinlake to finance loans. The asset originators provide the collateral assets to the permissioned RWA market by adding their DROP token to the pool in exchange for DAI. 


## Motivation
RWA bear monumental potential for DeFi in regards to volume, adoption and risk diversification. Pioneering lending in DeFi, Aave could be the game changer for millions of businesses by providing instant, bankless liquidity. When bridging the regulated world of Tradfi to trustless DeFi you encounter challenges that only few in DeFi have taken on so far. Centrifuge is planning to make use of the new [permissioned pool](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/tree/feat/permissioned-market) feature on Aave which is designed to be compliant with AML regulations and US securities guidelines. The pool itself will be public on Ethereum but only accessible to those that undergo KYC verification. 

Each Tinlake pool has two tokens: [DROP and TIN](https://developer.centrifuge.io/learn/understanding-tinlake/#drop--tin-the-two-tranches). DROP is the senior tranche token, protected by the TIN token, which takes first losses. We want to use these DROP tokens as collateral, for borrowing DAI. Please note that there is one DROP token per Tinlake pool (e.g. NewSilver: real estate backed loans, NS2-DROP; ConsolFreight: trade finance txs, CF4-DROP). Currently the majority of [Tinlake](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/) pools are denominated in Dai, meaning liquidity providers investing in a pool deposit Dai and receive interest bearing DROP tokens in return. On the permissioned RWA Market on Aave investors will be able to provide liquidity for a blended portfolio of DROP tokens. The design of the Tinlake infrastructure is focused on composability and allows for different types of investors to invest in a single pool. Some of our partners we work with are already onboarded to MakerDAO's MCD. This means individual pools have a corresponding vault on Maker and mint new DAI against their DROP collateral token. With the launch of the Centrifuge market on Aave our asset originators will gain additional liquidity sources and will be able to move their collateral freely between platforms following the best conditions instead of being siloed. To make beginnings easier for our asset originators they will only accept DAI and branch out to other stable coins long term.

Please find all **Specifications** on the [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-centrifuge-permissioned-rwa-market-proposal/4620)


#### Risk Considerations

Whereas it is a quite common occurrence that highly volatile crypto assets can quickly decrease in value and borrowers get liquidated from one hour to the next, RWA are different. Tinlake pools securitize balanced portfolios of real world assets, making the DROP tokens very stable assets. 

Tinlake's RWA have a maturity date that indicates when a loan needs to be repaid (maturity ranges from 60-90 days for invoices, to 12-24 months for mortgages). If an asset has not been paid back upon maturity an asset originator usually starts a collection process to recoup funds. The worst case scenario is the default of an asset. Asset originators factor in expected defaults into their interest rate calculation and asset specific advance rates (E.g. it is common practice to finance only 80-90% of the face value of an invoice).

Besides accounting for expected default via interest rates, all Tinlake pools have downside protection through the (Junior) TIN tranche. If for instance a single invoice of a balanced invoice portfolio defaults, TIN investors take first loss without impacting the DROP investors. Only if defaults exceed the pool specific TIN ratio the price of the DROP token is compromised. If this happens the pool is frozen which means that the asset originator cannot originate more loans until funds are recouped to pay out DROP investors (see an overview of our revolving pool mechanics [here](https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/community-call-october-15th-revolving-pools-and-tinlake-v3/291)).


#### Asset parameters
All Tinlake pools have existing risk parameters, most importantly the DROP APR. This is the interest rate that senior (DROP) investors receive on their capital (excluding any cash drag). This parameter reflects the risk of the underlying asset and the senior tranche investment. We propose to use the DROP APR as one of the main drivers to determine the Aave risk parameters while taking maturity, the asset class, the size of the pool and the diversification within the pool into consideration. 

In the table below we are proposing the following Aave risk parameters for our current live pools:  
![](https://storage.googleapis.com/centrifuge-hackmd/upload_826d1b9b2c166c1ff6f6b4185e8300b1.png)


We are exploring whether we can use some of the upcoming new features coming in the Aave V2.5 protocol, like the Exposure Ceiling and Borrow/Supply Caps, to ensure proper diversification and risk management in the market.

Every new pool that will be added to the permissioned pool will go through Aave governance and put up for vote. 

As for DAI, the currency which investors can use to participate in the market, we plan to only support variable rates in this market. Therefore, we propose the following Borrow Interest Rate for variable borrowing DAI:

| |DAI Borrow Interest Rate|
|-----|--------|
|U_optimal|90.00%|
|Base |1.00% | 
|Slope 1 |3.50% |
|Slope 2 |90% |

These are similar to the DAI parameters in the Aave V2 market, with a few exceptions. The optimal utilization rate was set to 90.00% to encourage high utilization of the market, to maximize capital efficiency and investor returns. The slope is slightly lower before the optimal utilization rate, to even out interest rates. Above the optimal utilization rate, the slope is even higher than in the Aave V2 market for DAI, as the optimal utilization rate is higher and thus this will lead to more incentive for repayments when liquidity runs out. The associated interest rate curve has been visualized below.

**Technical Specifications**

The Centrifuge market will be a new deployment of the Aave V2 protocol, using the permissioned market implementation. We have been working closely with Aave developers and are close to deploying a test version of this market to Kovan. This market differs in a few ways from the existing markets. For regulatory compliance, in order to provide liquidity for the Centrifuge market, investors will need to:

1. Pass KYC/AML checks.
2. Sign a Subscription Agreement for the Aave Centrifuge market.


***Price feed***
Each DROP token is linked to a Tinlake pool, which is a set of contracts. There is no secondary market for DROP tokens. The price of the token is based on a NAV (Net Asset Value) calculation, which updates each second. The DROP token price can be calculated from the [Assessor contract](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake/blob/develop/src/lender/assessor.sol#L135).

The Aave V2 protocol uses a Chainlink Aggregator by default as a price feed, and can use a fallback oracle if that doesn't exist. For DAI, we want to use the same oracle setup as DAI on the Aave V2 market. For our DROP tokens, we want to implement a fallback oracle contract, which retrieves the DROP token price from our Assessor contract.

***Liquidations***
Liquidations can be done by investors who have passed KYC and have signed the Subscription Agreement for specific Tinlake pools. These investors can participate in liquidations to receive DROP at a discount over investing directly into the pool. These DROP tokens can be used to place redemption requests on a specific Tinlake pool.

Each DROP [token](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake/blob/develop/src/lender/token/restricted.sol) is already restricted by a [memberlist contract](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake/blob/develop/src/lender/token/memberlist.sol). To avoid having to modify the Aave V2 core contracts, we will use a new proxy contract. This contract will be the only address with the liquidator role in the Centrifuge market.","['YAE', 'NAY']","[41588.35936489557, 3830.2160186832034]",1

Please read the application here: https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-building-a-mobile-app-for-aave/5298

Aave grants DAO committee supports this grant and would like to get a temperature check from the community.

We have been using Aave protocol and would love for Aave to have a decentralized app. Many mainstream users and crypto first-timers could enjoy using Aave on their phones. By developing a mobile app interface for Aave, we are hoping to accomplish followings:

- Onboarding new users to Aave protocol

- Ease of access to Aave protocol from mobile: checking healthfactor, reviewing proposals, voting, etc.

- User growth: more users interacting with protocol

- Increasing Aave TVL

We are a team of designers, developers, and product with backgrounds in DeFi UX design, video game design, contributor to graph protocol and IPFS, two times app featured on app store mobile engineer, and contributor to Aave and Yearn protocols.

Add MATIC as collateral on AAVE V2 market. 


Reference:
As detailed out in the proposal on https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-matic-token/3350, it would be a great utility for MATIC holders which are increasing by the day. 


Overview:
MATIC is the ecosystem token of Polygon Network (previously Matic) - a 100% EVM compatible scaling solution with current TVL of more than $5B and 500+ dapps deployed across DeFi, NFT, Gaming and DAO space. With the recent rebranding Matic has now expanded in scope and vision and have transformed into Polygon with the aim of becoming an L2 aggregator - thereby providing a developer with all L2 solutions - POS/Plasma chain (mainnet launched April 2020), zk and Optimistic Rollups and Validum chains.
The MATIC token lies at the heart of the Polygon ecosystem with multiple use-cases. Primarily the MATIC token is used for paying gas fees on the Polygon network. It runs the ecosystem, supporting top Dapps. Additionally you can participate in the Proof-of-Stake consensus of the blockchain as a validator node and earn 12-14% APY in MATIC tokens.


Positioning of MATIC token within the AAVE ecosystem:
Matic token is currently one of the most liquid altcoins on CEXs with daily spot volumes over 100M. The recent Coinbase listing was another achievement - further positioning MATIC as one of the premier altcoins.

Secondly, the whole NFT/Gaming boom has definitely made dapps like Decentraland, Decentral Games, Aavegotchi, Cometh, Polymarket, Quickswap household names in the space.


MATIC can play a unique role in the AAVE ecosystem in following ways -
Lending MATIC
Since MATIC is primarily a CEX traded coin, most of the speculation and activity remains confined there. Holders don’t have an additional source of revenue other than price speculation. With MATIC as a collateral on AAVE, holders will rush to seek yields, in turn boosting AAVE’s liquidity.
Borrow MATIC
In today’s high gas fees environment Ether is becoming scarcer by the day. DEX traders can depost Ether on Aave and can borrow Matic on lucrative interest rates. The borrowed Matic can be then provided in single pool dexes like Bancor on L1 and QuickSwap/ComethSwap on L2 to capture liquidity pools of a growing DeFi ecosystem on Polygon.

title: Add DPI on Aave V2
status: WIP
author: Matthew Graham (@MatthewGraham)
shortDescription: Add DPI on Aave V2
discussions:  https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576
created: 2021-07-19

## Simple Summary

Add DPI as collateral support for DPI to the Aave market. 

## Abstract

Add DPI to Aave V2 market.

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets across the market.

DPI is an ERC20 token that enables users to gain exposure to a basket of DeFi protocols via single transaction. The reduced volatility and broad diversification is a great property for collateral.

The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. DPI aims to track the projects in DeFi that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. At the time of writing there are 14 tokens included in DPI. 

## Motivation

Aave would be the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform. DPI is becoming a DeFi standard and adding DPI would dramatically increase support for these efforts. 

There are over 12,000 DPI holders and growing. Adding DPI as collateral would bring users into the Aave ecosystem allowing capital, yield and value to accrue to Aave participants.

## Specification

DPI is a market capitalization weighted index product that follows a predetermined qualitative and quantitative methodology. The composition of the DPI portfolio is maintained by DeFi Pulse. 

The DPI token has no governance characteristics and is predominantly traded via the V2 Uniswap DPI-ETH pool. DPI is supported and maintained by Index Coop and is built on TokenSets infrastructure. 

At the time of writing, DPI has a market capitalization of greater than $220M and is the most readily traded DeFi index product.

There is an annual 95 basis point fee for holders of DPI that is split 70/30 between Index Coop and DeFi Pulse respectively. 

DPI-ETH earns INDEX rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 20% APR, in addition to around 5% in trading fee income with limited impermanent loss.

## Rationale

By purchasing DPI, users are able to gain exposure to leading DeFi protocols in the form of a single ERC20 token. The risk of holding just a select few protocols within a portfolio is diversified away, giving holders broad theme based exposure to DeFi.  

With Aave currently making up 20.88% of DPI, there is no better way for Aave to support DPI’s widespread adoption, than to enable DPI being utilized for borrowing and lending. With DPI trading since October 2020 and 90 day average trading volume of around $7.2M.

Additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi

## Test Cases

Being a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support DPI. 

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any AIP is given status ""Implemented"", but it need not be completed before the AIP is ""Approved"". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of ""rough consensus and running code"" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## DPI - Aave Risk Assessment 

Details can be found on the Aave governance forum post linked below.
https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576/9

# Overal Risk Score: B-

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is an index product managed by Index Coop. At the time of writing there are 324,355 DPI in circulation. DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Smart Contract Risk: C-

DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Counterparty Risk: C

DPI is a product whereby holders of DPI have no metagovernance influence on Index Coop or the protocol within the index. DPI trades on the ethereum network and inherits the trust of the network much like USDC. DPI has over 12,055 holders and the DPI-ETH pool is Uniswap’s 17th largest at $90M. Anyone can Mint, Trade and Redeem DPI.

The DPI utilises TokenSets V2 smart contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin audit [September 4th, 2020] which identified privilege roles in many of the contracts. The key findings are highlighted below:

* The Controller contract has an owner that chooses the contracts that comprise the system. This includes all of the modules, resources and the factories that can be used to make Sets. 

* The IntegrationRegistry tracks third party integrations that can be used in the system. It also has an owner that can add, remove and edit the integrations as desired. 

* The PriceOracle has a list of oracles and adapters that can be used to retrieve third party prices. It also has an owner role that can choose the supported oracles, adapters and price pairs.

# DPI Market Risk: B-

DPI’s price tracks the Net Asset Value of the underlying assets, by holding a basket of protocol tokens the volatility of a single asset is dampened. This is reflected by DPI having a standard deviation of 5.75% since exception compared to ETH and AAVE which has a standard deviation of 5.03% and 7.79% respectively over the same time period (03/10/2021 to 01/05/2021). When considering liquidity, the average daily trading volume is $7.19M, based on over a trailing 90 day trading period. However, DPI holders have the option to mint/redeem the underlying tokens within DPI which draws on the liquidity of the underlying assets and also allows for any deviation from NAV to be arbitraged away by traders.

Paragraph Summary

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.

All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. It has generated over 13,000 ETH in revenue (16M+ USD) so far.

Motivation

Add $AXS as a lending currency into Aave money markets.

By listing $AXS you will be able to leverage an entire nation of gamers.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
**
** Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released
AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.

These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.

Version 2 - Early 2022

More on-chain votes about smaller issues.

Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.

Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization

AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.

Potential things that can be voted on:

Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?

Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?

How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?

Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?

How is the asset currently used?
*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here 3.

The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

**Discourse Thread**
https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/setting-a-fixed-cap-on-new-wearables/4211

**Problem**

Over the lifespan of Aavegotchi, we've endured many wearable dilution events which have negatively impacted our community by:

• Loss of investor confidence (and investors)
• Depreciation of asset values
• No known schedule for releases, resulting in uncertainty in the markets
• In bullish conditions, new wearables would be released, capping our upside growth

It makes sense to have a wearables budget. Something the whole community can see and investors can easily digest. A cap based on total live gotchis was proposed, but in truth it does not accurately depict the true usage of assets.

The community by and large agrees on a budget, however at this moment in time, we don't have the metrics or data to create one. This budget is likely going to come from data such as daily active users (once PvP is live).

**Proposal**

This proposal is simple and straightforward:

1. No new BRS-based wearables until the DAO votes on a budget

2. That budget will be developed at a later date once the data is available

The idea is to restore investor confidence and allow us to sleep a bit easier at night, knowing that our assets will not suffer from spontaneous dilution. 

Note: this proposal does not include aesthetic wearables, new set creations, or set rebalances (such as Link Marine)

**Associated Risks**

I don't see any potential risks for this proposal.","['Yes, stop new wearables', 'No, keep things as is']","[15123387.59016686, 702835.3687606188]",1

Gotchi ID: 19172, 21107

Hello frens,

The DAO recently voted to disable spillover with a 71% majority due to the game being heavily botted. Bots were taking up considerable developer bandwidth which was delaying the upcoming game features and causing a lot of sell pressure on alchemica prices. Dan recently proposed the Cartridge invite system which, while not a direct solution to botting, does introduce some incentives in attempt to reduce the amount of botters and extractors collecting spillover. Currently we don't know how effective the cartridge proposal would be but the DAO is in agreement that if we were to enable spillover again then then we would need to implement the cartridge proposal in an attempt to reduce the botting issue. If we do decide to implement cartridges then Coderdan would lead the project with a team of solidity and realm developers.

The choice we have to make with the harvester release coming up mid July is either:

a) Keep spillover turned off

OR 

b) Turn spillover back on and implement the cartridge system

The participents of the DAO meeting were fairly split on which choice to make so here's the TLDR to both sides of the argument.

In favor of keeping spillover turned off:
- No incentive to bot means no bots
- No implementation or smart contracts risks from new cartridge system
- No unintended side effects of a new system (cartridges)
- No risks to further delays for harvesters
- Less sell pressure on alchemica from botters/extractors
- Dev time spent on cartridges can be used for PVP/Traits/SDK instead
- Doesn't require a community team focused on manually banning bots
- Allows more time to develop ideas for cartridges/invites and anti botting measures


In favor of turning spillover back on and implementing the cartridge system:
- Spillage and management of P2E players is a core game mechanic
- Activity in game and in Discord has been greatly reduced, since we stopped spillage
- Allows us to test an anti botting solution early
- Caartridges incentivise owning multiple Gotchis
- Spillover is an integral part of rewarding player engagement
- Rental markets are largely funded by spillover","['Keep spillover turned off', 'Turn spillover on + caartridges']","[10843446.819729695, 1829389.697049592]",1

**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/utilizing-the-channeling-hot-zone/4055

There has been a lot of heated discussion about bots, scholars, spillover and more. A lot of it completely misses the point though, at least in my opinion. I went more in-depth on why I don't believe botting to be the primary problem at the moment in a comment here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/keeping-the-status-quo-of-disabled-spillover-for-a-while/3845/172

So I started playing around with the numbers for spillover radius & rate, but I just couldn't find a satisfying solution. Reducing them only by a bit would barely have an effect, while reducing them drastically would devalue high level Aaltars. When I went through the blog post on channeling radius it finally clicked though! The mechanic was right there, just not utilized to its full potential (or at all really): The Hot Zone.

  
![cdb60288d7d0c96c4c7a5ec3bb767a4174b44326_2_441x375.jpeg](ipfs://QmUntsAfd6SLoj11eMkoMQ7AqiW13krfxrGWyzHb7yKxh5)
    

It became obvious pretty quickly that the Hot Zone wasn't so hot after all. The name simply implied that statistically speaking, 10% of the spillover would spawn inside of the inner 10% radius, 20% inside of the inner 20%, etc. This results in a slightly higher drop rate closer to the parcel, but in reality it barely makes a difference (only a single digit % of all spillover spawns in the ""Hot Zone""). I want to propose allocating a fixed % of the spilled Alchemica based on Aaltar level as outlined in the model below:

 
![8d72bfd571de3af3d94599dfb9f9504b37deab13.png](ipfs://QmSMdQzxv2uU2KQpdrqpoYV6pXjgmjfSWrvERqtpUHzVfe)
    

Combined with a proposed radius of 60 Gotchis (compared to the 64x32 measurements of a Spacious), dropping a larger amount of Alchemica inside of the Hot Zone would suddenly make spillover feel much more like actual spillover instead of a random token drop around the map. Here's what that would look in-game:

![hot zone radius 60.png](ipfs://QmTXCJyFw9P6NB3XvPozgtrAoLBNR1JN5B2hGjSKB5mX3M)

Imo this would:

- Create an interesting mechanic around the concept of spillover (as seen in the OG trailer)
- Add an incentive for players to pick up their spilled tokens instead of channeling & logging off (and writing off the spillover completely)
- Reduce the advantage of bots, since picking up spillover becomes less of a grinding & more of a channeling mechanic
- Overall make the Gotchiverse in its current form more interesting

Lastly, I would like to note one thing. This proposal suggests introducing the Hot Zone mechanic as soon as spillover is resumed. However, the reverse is not the case. This proposal is not a vote to turn spillover back on, I merely believe it to be one piece in the larger puzzle","['Yes, use the proposed model', 'No, don’t change anything']","[17101745.674035598, 455644.2323700607]",1

Hello frens,

We are fast approaching the end of June when the LAND 3 auction/raffle is scheduled for based on the AGIP30 core prop. However, since this core prop was started (20th May) a lot of things have changed:

- Harvester release has been delayed
- We are in the middle of a bloodbath in the markets
- LAND prices have dropped 30-70%
- LAND bazaar volume has dropped 90%
- There's been huge selling pressure on alchemica prices

Due to these significant changes in the market, its seems right to allow the DAO to have another emergency vote on whether to go ahead with the LAND auction or not as releasing an auction in this market is very likely to drive down assets prices across the ecosystem.

Coderdan confirmed it is viable to stop the auction but we must act quickly frens:

**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/token-swap-1-75m-dai-from-aavegotchidao-for-ghst-from-pixelcraft-studios/3769

**Summary**
This proposal aims to swap 1.75 million DAI from AavegotchiDAO’s treasury with an equal value of GHST from Pixelcraft Studios’ balance sheet.

**Rationale**
The launch of the Gotchiverse has introduced new and increasing infra costs for Pixelcraft Studios that cannot be paid for in GHST (or any crypto for that matter). These costs primarily consist of usage of AWS and Redis Enterprise for real-time gameplay in the Gotchiverse, and will continue to scale up as the game gets more popular.

To pay for these costs, we have outlined several options:

- Raise funding from VCs
- Liquidate GHST into DAI and swap for fiat
- Use GHST as collateral on Aave to take loans in DAI
- Perform a token swap with AavegotchiDAO

We believe Option 4 (Token Swap) is the best available option at the moment. We strongly value our independence from VCs, prefer not to have debt on our balance sheet, and do not want to market sell GHST acquired from sales.

Therefore, we propose a token swap between AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios to ensure adequate fiat runway for several years of further development, no matter how bearish the market becomes.

**Key Details**
At the time of this writing, AavegotchiDAO treasury holds roughly:
- 2.5 Million DAI
- 3.5 Million GHST
- 3 Million Alchemica

(Live source here: https://app.aavegotchi.com/treasury) 


Pixelcraft Studios, on the other hand, is heavily skewed toward GHST with over 6.7 Million GHST in our primary revenue wallet while our only DAI is coming from the curve’s monthly 150k DAI faucet, 50k of which is already earmarked for GHST purchases.

Pixelcraft Studios has been able to effectively grow the team and support infrastructure costs without needing to liquidate any significant amount of GHST. But last month’s launch of the Gotchiverse and anticipated continued growth has pushed operating costs dramatically higher. Server costs for the April playdrop, for example, exceeded 40k USD, and that is projected to grow in the months ahead.

Such operating expenses are anticipated but we have to acknowledge that these subscriptions and invoices almost always insist on trad banking (fiat). We would prefer to not have to sell GHST in order to achieve the necessary growth budget.

The DAO’s revenue from the GHST bonding curve opens up the possibility of a large-scale exchange of assets between our two parties. With the game live, GHST off its all time highs, and a DAO treasury that is well established, we believe this is the right time to propose an OTC token swap.

For the purposes of this token swap, a valuation for GHST that all can agree on must be established. There are many ways to arrive at such, so in the interest of expediency, I am proposing an intuitive method that also tips the scale generously in the DAO’s direction:

**GHST valuation methodology**
Pixelcraft Studios has calculated GHST’s average price from Tuesday, June 14 to Saturday, June 18 (duration of the SigProp via CoinGecko) with a 5% discount applied to the final price: USD 1.28. If DAO voters find the results agreeable, they may vote to approve this CoreProp.

**Execution**
If the CoreProp passes, the token swap should process in a predictable way. I suggest the token swap occur with the following method of execution:

- Pixelcraft Studios shall first transfer the agreed upon amount of GHST (defined in the CoreProp) to the AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet.
- AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet (currently managed via multisig by Pixelcraft team) shall transfer 1.75 million DAI within 8 hours of receiving the GHST to the Pixelcraft Studios primary revenue wallet.
- Pixelcraft Studios shall make an announcement in Aavegotchi Discord confirming the reception of the DAI, thus concluding the token swap.

**Bot Strategy:**
https://github.com/mikey-jay/realm-simulator#readme

**Problem**

The original harvester recipes:

- Discourage upgrading parcels beyond levels 3 & 4.
- Are too expensive in cost and punishing in yields at the higher levels.
- Easily allow for the Low Leveloor to extract insanely high yields with very little investment.
- Are too inexpensive from a time-to-build perspective. This diminishes the effectiveness of makers and the utility of GLTR.

After a month and a half of theorising, simulating, and refining MikeyJay, coderdan, letsgobankless, and myself have arrived at a final recipe which we believe best solves the above problem.

The proposed recipe changes to the harvester:

- Promote dynamic gameplay with a multitude of winning strategies
- Make high level harvesters not only viable, but desirable
- Reduces inflation of alchemica
- Handicap the Low Leveloor strategy
- Significantly increase build time for each installation which promote a healthy GLTR economy. *This increase drives more utility to the maaker.*
This topic has been discussed at length. For a full understanding, I highly encourage you to read through the forum thread, simulation results, and recipe changes found in the links above. The Bot Strategy link provides insight into how the simulation bots operated.

 
![harvester simulation.png](ipfs://QmWgKmR9Ndmbz6nSZ9AUm6kKkJ7GA4Djb7PKh2h1efNLZ6)
    

This heat map gives a general overview of the expected ROIs. Please bear in mind bots are not intuitive. They follow a very specific set of commands (see link above for those rules)

**Associated Risks**

Given the amount of time invested in recreating this recipe, there are few contingencies.

The reduction in alchemica inflation also means a reduced ROI (in terms of alchemica, not necessarily $$$)

In line with the core prop passed via governance on feb 15th, I’d like to take this moment to formalise the start of rarity farm S4 with the gotchi-DAO. You can refer to the previous proposal, AGIP23, here: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x5ffa4d3b8f4c1d744424af5c0f079ebfa286c9aec9c35e898c2c02bee87a0b60

Since no major changes to the BRS, XP or kinship systems have occurred since the last season and since the passing of the proposal, I suggest we keep parameters equal to what they were for S3.

Following that, this would be the final model for SZN4:

4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the land sale of AGIP30, for which the core prop passed here: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x658926263e4ce1eca559950bcb0f5d8f203758c5c99b30999bb7f082552695b8

- 70% BRS
- 20% Kinship
- 10% XP
- Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)

In the event where the land sale of AGIP30 does not lead to a RF pool of 1.5m GHST or higher, I suggest we make the rest of the 1.5m GHST prize pool whole via the DAO treasury as previously discussed in AGIP 23.

The DAO is potentially going to get rebalanced with a lot of GHST due to a recent pixelcraft-lead proposal for a DAI buyback that might pass governance in the near future, so it would tie in handily to that.

Since the introduction of GLTR and the launch of Realm, much discussion has been held on what is appropriate to do about tickets.

The FRENS mechanic is outdated and many feel causes unsatisfactory experiences for those who buy tickets and are at the mercy of DAO votes to delay raffles.

This proposal does three things -

Upon passage, FRENS emissions will be reduced by .1 FRENS and continue to be reduced by 0.1 FRENS per month, until they stop completely.
Tickets will be purchasable with GLTR, and redeemable for GLTR at a 10% restocking fee
Tickets bought with FRENS cannot be redeemed for GLTR, as there is no supply of GLTR allocated for this. A second sigprop could be raised, to have the DAO stake it's alchemica for GLTR, if this is desired.
Currently, drop tickets(10k frens) have a floor of 2.5 GHST, which is 127k GLTR
This would be 1.27 GLTR per FRENS at todays rates.
To not further destroy the ticket market by undercutting it, Pixelcraft will set the FRENS/GLTR ratio at the time that Pixelcraft has the technology ready to release. This will prevent people from manipulating the market, as only Pixelcraft will know when they are shipping.","['Yes', 'No']","[6919431.277889018, 7199134.206871988]",0

### Problem
**The original harvester recipes:**

- Discourage upgrading parcels beyond levels 3 & 4. 
- Are too expensive in cost and punishing in yields at the higher levels.
- Easily allow for the Low Leveloor to extract insanely high yields with very little investment.
- Are too inexpensive from a time-to-build perspective. This diminishes the effectiveness of makers and the utility of GLTR.

After a month and a half of theorising, simulating, and refining MikeyJay, coderdan, letsgobankless, and myself have arrived at a final recipe which we believe best solves the above problem. 

**The proposed recipe changes to the harvester:**

- Promote dynamic gameplay with a multitude of winning strategies
- Make high level harvesters not only viable, but desirable
- Reduces inflation of alchemica 
- Handicap the Low Leveloor strategy
- Significantly increase build time for each installation which promote a healthy GLTR economy. *This increase drives more utility to the maaker.* 

This topic has been discussed at length. For a full understanding, I highly encourage you to read through the forum thread, simulation results, and recipe changes found in the links above. The Bot Strategy link provides insight into how the simulation bots operated.

This heat map gives a general overview of the expected ROIs. Please bear in mind bots are not intuitive. They follow a very specific set of commands (see link above for those rules)

**Associated Risks**

Given the amount of time invested in recreating this recipe, there are few contingencies.

The reduction in alchemica inflation also means a reduced ROI (in terms of alchemica, not necessarily $$$) ","['Yes, Change the Recipes', 'No, Keep Things the Same']","[14508253.583220445, 159189.22378400294]",1

Discourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/standard-operating-procedures-for-dao-task-forces-and-committees/3665

Standard operating procedures (SOP) are required for the Aavegotchi DAO committees and task forces to operate as intended. The goal of this document is to provide the DAO with the tools and governance structure to carry out their intended duties and navigate various membership obstacles. The Aavegotchi community has extensively reviewed and contributed to the formation of this document. Modifications or edits can be made prior to the core proposal. Please comment on the document, facilitate community discussion, and ensure your concerns are addressed. If the core proposal passes, changes and additions to the SOP can only be made via DAO vote

The Aavegotchi DAO SOP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYgJiDqtOBgPyq_NRAxXME1Xw3_5ByxY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100550936649233683179&rtpof=true&sd=true

The TL;DR of the document: 
•	Individual task force members and the DAO can vote to remove elected members. A removal process is outlined in the document.
•	The DTF extended multi-sig will be reviewed every 6 months
•	The default task force review will be yearly
•	A process for temporary membership is outlined with a defined maximum number of temporary members (no more than 1/3 of the committee)

Thank you to the many contributors, especially Gadfly for applying his writing and legal expertise in the document’s formation.

Currently, gotchi channeling resets every 24-hours, with this reset happening at midnight UTC.   While the 24-hour window is popular with community members, being bound to the single, universal reset time is causing stress for both the game servers and the community.  

We propose players be allowed to reset their 24-hour windows to a time of their choosing for a small $GLTR fee.  Details are as follows:   
- By default, the reset time will remain midnight UTC.
- Gotchis will still channel one time within a 24hr window.
- Players can customize their reset time by paying 10,000 $GLTR.
- The new reset time will be set when the gotchi channels after the fee is paid.
- There is no slippage of channeling time.   (For example if you reset your window to 9am but on the next day, you don't channel until 11am, your window will still open at 9am the day after that.)  Players can channel when it suits them.
- Devs have confirmed that bulk gotchi resets will be possible to assist players with large numbers of gotchis.
- For multiple gotchis, the $GLTR reset fee will be paid per gotchi and the time will be reset to when the first gotchi in the batch channels.
- To prevent abuse, players must wait 60 hours before resetting again.
- This mechanic has the added benefit of providing a burn mechanism for $GLTR.","['YES!  Let players pick.', 'NO!  Keep the universal reset.']","[4020633.3035426536, 1193726.329145958]",1

**Discourse Thread:** [https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128)

**Introduction**

The open-source nature of the Aavegotchi protocol combined with its on-chain assets provides an excellent foundation for external development efforts.  More specifically, third-party developed games can greatly expand the usability of Aavegotchi assets and provide growth to the entire project. 

**Problem**

When developing 3rd party games for the Aavegotchi protocol, there is currently a lack of:

- A definitive process for taking a game from concept to Pixelcraft XP event,
- API’s and rules for implementing server security and anti-cheat mechanisms,
- Guidance for new developers seeking funding from Pixelcraft or the AavegotchiDAO,
- Utilisation of rewards from AGIP16 Stake 100k GHST to generate Minigame Rewards,
- Organized periodic game events to breathe life back into old mini-games
- Structured testing procedures that ensure sufficient quality and performance benchmarks are met prior to releasing games to the wider Aavegotchi community.

**Solution**

This proposal aims to introduce and confirm the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF). The ATF’s primary focus will be to support game development efforts that incorporate assets from the Aavegotchi protocol.

Initially, the ATF will have the following responsibilities:

- Distribution and accountability for all raffle tickets/rewards generated per AGIP16,
- Development of application forms/checklists for game developers seeking raffle tickets/rewards to be issued as prizes in their games,
- Implementation of an ATF game approval voting system that publicly records raffle ticket/reward approvals for transparency to the wider Aavegotchi community,
- Development of a **”From Concept to Pixelcraft XP Event”** document that guides developers through the concept, feedback, stress test, giveaway event and Pixelcraft XP event phases of a successful Aavegotchi protocol Aarcade game,
- Organization of periodic Aavegotchi mini-game events/giveaways.

**End Goal & Benefit**

The ATF’s short term goal is to help incentivize the development of more mini-games of a higher quality for the Aavegotchi community to play, share and enjoy with the natural benefit being increased utility and growth for the Aavegotchi protocols assets.

Long term, the ATF aims to support the development of the Aavegotchi Aarcade, player base and its stakeholders.

**Potential Risks**

As we are in the early stages of forming the Aarcade Task Force some potential risks include:

- ATF members voting on their own games for approval (mitigated by making these members abstain from votes on their games)
- Awarding raffle tickets before a game is even finished (clear check points need to be implemented)
- Mismanagement, theft or loss of rewards (a multi-sig wallet will be setup),
- ATF members becoming inactive (onboard/offboard procedures will be required)

**ATF Members**

The initial 12 members of the ATF will be the following. These members have all actively participated in the Aavegotchi community for over a year now, come from different backgrounds and consist of experienced developers, security experts and gamers:

- alvi#1123
- chair #6121
- Coyote#3131
- enoonmai#4469
- Gotchinomics#4936
- Hefe#1514
- Hotspur#9218
- ricJones | Grizzy#9187
- shah#0369
- Slick#2526
- SpyceBringer#2075
- Thunderfish#4370

These members will also be the signers for the ATF multi-sig treasury wallet used to:

- Control distribution of rewards from AGIP16 100k GHST Staking,
- Manage funds from any future development grants awarded to the ATF,
- Manage Income/Expenditure of any future ATF developed websites/platforms

**Conclusion**

On a final note, AGIP16 required that 100% of frens generated from the 100k GHST staking be converted to raffle tickets for distribution to gamers during mini-game events. For flexibility, the ATF request the following amendments to this reward structure:

1) Raffle tickets may be converted to other Aavegotchi NFT’s/tokens of equal market value to help provide more diverse giveaways,

2) 50% of the 100k Staked GHST is moved into wapGHST staking to generate GLTR to further ease conversion of rewards into other Aavegotchi NFT’s/tokens,

3) 10% of the value of a games giveaway event prize pool be awarded to game developers **after** their giveaway event as a bonus incentive for shipping their game! This will also help support the developers higher server costs during the month of the giveaway event.

All transactions, conversions and ATF votes will be documented and made public for complete community transparency. In addition, any ticket/GLTR redemptions (or transfer of AGIP16 GHST staking control) still need to be approved and signed off by the DAO Treasury Force (DTF).

Link to Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/make-estate-building-worthwhile/3662/20


Summary:

There is a problem with the currently proposed estate building mechanics. Since linking parcels is restricted by the presence of an upgraded lodge, it is quite expensive to link parcels with very little benefit for doing so. This can be fixed by linking the estate size limit to a parcel's Aaltar level rather than Lodge level. 


End goal and benefits: 

Estate building is a great opportunity to create a fun meta-game of building a large estate and help users see the value of a parcel as more than just its alchemica-harvesting potential. The goal of this sigprop is to help realize this future for potential land-holders.


Potential risks or negative consequences:

This proposal would decrease the demand for Lodges and make estates easier to create. It would probably increase the demand for higher-level aaltars.


Alternative paths:

There are two approaches to solving this problem: 

#1 increase the benefit of estates 
#2 decrease the cost of creating estates

Since Coderdan clarified things like sharing installations between estate parcels would require significant development, those in the forum mostly agreed that the best solution for now is to lower the cost of creating an estate. However there were a couple other ideas which gained support in the poll: Making estates visible on the mini-map, and adding an outgoing teleportation radius to estates. These can be discussed and proposed in a separate proposal if desired.

Land Auction/Raffle #3 Proposal:

- Hold the Auction and Raffle within June
- 8,000 Parcels in total from predominantly districts 1, 6, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26. Parcels from previously auctioned/raffled districts are also included. The exact selection can be seen in the Discussion Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-for-land-auction-raffle-3-within-1-week-of-citaadel-release/3487/36
- 70% (5,600) of parcels in the auction, 30% (2,400) in the raffle

Proposed Revenue Distribution:
- 40% of Revenue to the Rarity Farming Rewards Pool
- 40% to Pixelcraft Studios
- 20% to the AavegotchiDAO
- 0% Burn

This proposal is synthesized from community feedback over the last few weeks and attempts to balance the following: NFT dilution; an auction/raffle feeling too rushed; inadequate available GHST liquidity; concern for the funding of Rarity Farming Season 4; capitalizing on the momentum and marketing of the full game release. A June Auction will allow >2 weeks of Citaadel gameplay and will allow sufficient time for marketing and business development efforts to capture maximum investment. There is an adequate Gotchiverse Rewards Pool after the first two land auctions, and this sale will help fund RFS4 and perhaps even some of Season 5.

This proposal has been discussed with the Pixelcraft team who support it and feel the target date is feasible.

**PROPOSAL**

As specified in Gotchiverse Bible Chapter 3, solo gotchi channeling will work via a 24 hour cooldown timer that starts immediately after a gotchi channels at an altar. We propose that this be revised to a windowed 24 hour system that runs from 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC in which a gotchi can solo channel once, anytime within that 24 hour window.

**TIMELINE**

Proposal to be implemented on or before May 18, 2022 (the commencement date of solo channeling) or as soon thereafter as Pixelcraft can ship...

**RATIONALE**

With the introduction of the 12 hour petting cooldown system a year ago, we have all come to realize that a set interaction time with your gotchi is hard to maintain given real world events, network congestion, family and work commitments. We do not want to repeat this limitation with solo gotchi channeling.

The above limitation has led to the development of automated bots to guarantee interaction efficiency which, arguably, results in lower user engagement. By removing this limitation for solo channeling, it is much more likely that players will organically engage with their gotchi for solo channeling on a daily basis.

Many players have multiple gotchis, multiple parcels and multiple altars spread all throughout the Citaadel. These players have shown amazing support in our community and should not be restricted in their efficiency by a 24 hour cooldown. They should still be able to comfortably channel once per day with all their gotchis when their busy schedules suit.

**BENEFITS**

The 24 hour channeling solution would:

- Improve quality of life for gotchi owners,
- Mitigate unfavorable interaction times,
- Mitigate network congestion at interaction time, and,
- Increase daily engagement for time-poor players.

**RISKS**

Proposal implementation date may be delayed if Pixlecraft encounters technical challenges or is otherwise unable to meet the May 18, 2022 implementation date.

**Summary**
With the introduction of Gotchiverse trait maps in the Game Bible Chapter 2, a significant discussion kicked off analyzing potential imbalances, weaknesses and areas for innovation in the original proposed trait map for NRG, AGG, SPK & BRN. This CoreProp proposes to change the trait mappings for these 4 traits to:

**NRG:** HP Capacity (0 NRG) <===> AP Capacity (100 NRG)
**AGG:** Defense Power (0 AGG) <===> Action Speed (100 AGG)
**SPK:** HP & AP Regen (0 SPK) <===> Ethereality (100 SPK)
**BRN:** Melee Power (0 BRN) <===> Ranged Power (100 BRN)
**EYS:** To Be Confirmed
**EYC:** To Be Confirmed

Please refer to the DAO forum thread linked above for a full rundown on what these changes mean (including an FAQ section).

**Core Effects of the New Trait Map**

* Movement speed removed from trait maps will now lead to an improved quality of life user experience (UX) for all players starting out in the Gotchiverse, both new and old,
* Carrying capacity removed from trait maps corrects the imbalance of 1 farming trait vs. 7 combat traits on NRG, AGG, SPK and BRN,
* There is now a clear distinction between physical and ability specialist (mage) gotchis,
* There is now a clear distinction between melee and ranged gotchis,
* Ethereality can now be thought of as “Luck” and influences evasion, critical strikes, slipping through walls and all sorts of other chance based actions in the Gotchiverse.

**End Goal**
For the community and Pixelcraft to build a trait map together that is balanced, has excellent UX, playability and longevity while simultaneously allowing the flexibility to implement wearable buffs and abilities that work with the traits in the future.

**Risks**
There is potential that some players and investors have already purchased gotchis based on the original trait mappings. It is important to note that these traits were always specified as non-immutable in the Game Bible HOWEVER, we strongly believe the new trait maps proposed here will create even moar diverse and entertaining play styles for OG investors and new players alike to experiment with and enjoy playing.

**Final Important Notes**

* There are a number of ways these Traits can scale (Yin/Yang linear, asymmetric, buff only starting from 50 and diminishing returns to name a few). The Trait Scaling System is still under review by the community so look forward to further calls with Pixelcraft (to really get into the nitty gritty) and another SigProp!
* EYS and EYC are still under review by the community. A number of interesting ideas including farming/alchemica/HUD abilities have been proposed. Make sure you get involved and have your say on how you’d like to see these evolve too!

GHST is a popular asset listed on many spot market including DEX and CEX. But GHST is not listed yet on any perpetual market or market with leverage. Once listed, there will be an increase of trading volume of GHST in both derivative market and spot market, which in a long term will benefit the popularity and price of GHST.

We propose to list GHST on TripleFi (https://triple.fi/). 
TripleFi is a derivative perpetual DEX on Polygon and can list GHST/USDT with 5x leverage.

There will be no cost for a listing. However GHST/USDT trading pair will launch once liquidity pool exceeds 10k USDT in the liquidity pool. Therefore we suggest to deposit 10k into the liquidity pool of GHST/USDT pair after listing. The liquidity can be withdrawn and liquidity pool will generate a return above 30% APR in a fully traded pair which is also beneficial for the DAO.

Discourse Thread:   https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/add-ghst-stake-to-the-umbria-narni-bridge/2836

The Umbria Narni Bridge has implemented the GHST token, and is facilitating cheaper migration of GHST between the Ethereum <--> Polygon networks, compared to the official Polygon bridge. The Umbria Narni bridging cost is about 1/2 of the official polygon bridge cost and is also much faster (4 minutes, as opposed to > 1 hour).

The Umbria Narni bridge protocol can bridge a maximum of 20% of its total GHST liquidity, per bridging event. For example, with $100k of GHST tokens in one side of the pool, the bridge can migrate a maximum of $20k of GHST per single transaction.

Currently there is approximately $14,000 of GHST tokens on each side of the bridge. This is mostly funded by the Umbria team. This enables the bridge to be able to bridge a maximum of $700 of GHST tokens per transaction - which is pretty good, but we are aware that some users want to bridge much more in a single transaction.

We propose the Aavegotchi DAO add $100,000 of GHST to each bridge pool (1. Polygon and 2. Ethereum). There are a few advantages for doing so:

The Aavegotchi DAO will earn a 0.2% bridging fee whenever anyone uses the bridge to migrate GHST tokens between Ethereum <--> Polygon. So across time, the Aavegotchi DAO will make money. If the Narni bridge ever becomes an unnecessary solution, the Aavegotchi DAO can easily remove their liquidity and enjoy their profit.

Transactions up to approximately $21,000 of GHST will now be possible.

The Aavegotchi community will learn about our bridge which enables migration of assets for WAY cheaper than the official polygon bridge. A great quality of life improvement if they are participating in other projects too.

Unlike the official Polygon bridge who offer absolutely no technical support, even in the event of a bridge error, the Umbria Narni bridge has a dedicated discord support team who have an excellent reputation for speedily resolving any issues and guarantee transaction resolution in the event of an unforeseen error.

The Umbria Narni bridge is administered and coordinated by a publicly listed company Online Blockchain PLC from the UK, who are bound by the rules and regulations of the UK financial conduct authority. It has also been audited by ADVFN, and is in the process of several other audits.

The Umbria project is officially partnered with Polygon, as well as a number of popular NFT projects including Zedrun, The Red Village and many others.

**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/provide-ghst-as-liquidity-on-the-derivatives-dex-synfutures/2664

Since Aavegotchi has gathered a lot of liquidity on Spot DEXes, it is high time for Aavegotchi to create and boost its Futures market. Derivatives markets make up the majority of global trading activity and allow users to leverage their investments. Adding GHST liquidity on SynFutures would allow people to take on leverage longs (or shorts) on the future of Aavegotchi. But why SynFutures?

**Great investors and team background**
SynFutures is backed by Polychain, Pantera, Dragonfly, Framework, Standard Crypto, Woo, and more. The team’s background is a great combination of traditional finance and DeFi. SynFutures is the only project of its kind which can support the listing of any assets by anyone in a permissionless manner (in less than 30s).

**Security**
Backed by solid experience from the TradFi financial engineering and DeFi protocol safety, SynFutures has many risk management features (e.g. anti-flashloan attack, EMA smoothing method, etc.) and has gone through external code audits.

**Easy to manage and start**
SynFutures supports a single token model to add liquidity which means the Aavegotchi Treasury would only have to deposit GHST instead of offering two tokens with the risk of impermanent loss. We are asking for 200k worth of GHST tokens to kickstart the pool. The liquidity could be withdrawn anytime.

**Growth Potential**
Trading volume and users are growing fast on SynFutures. For the past 3 months since the SynFutures Alpha launched, we reached 47k users of and $1bn+ in trading volume. All this happened without a native SynFutures token, which could attract even more users.

**Volume analysis**
Quickswap vs. SynFutures:
Total LPs: 150k / 40K
Total traders: 100k / 20k
Daily trading volume: $100M / $29M

SynFutures trading volume makes up ~1/3rd of QuickSwap, and the amount of traders is 1/5th as big as on QuickSwap, however, the trading volume for different pairs is more concentrated. SynFutures has 108 trading pairs while QuickSwap has more than 22k pairs. For example, the daily trading volume of MATIC-USDC on SynFutures closes in on around $9M, while Quickswap reaches $14M.

The first ever cross-chain AIP passed and will be enforced on Jan 28th, meaning GHST will become a collateral in Aave polygon Market.

A GHST deposits into Aave will mint to the user amGHST an interest-bearing asset redeemable at 1:1 for GHST.

Proposal:

A) Create amGHST staking alongside current GHST staking vault with same FRENS emissions.
As such 1 amGHST staked will yield 1 FREN per day.

B) Do not create an amGHST vault and keep status quo.

Benefits:
1) AmGHST stakers will earn Aave GHST yield on top of their FRENS yield.
2) Incentivize liquidity of GHST into AAVE attracting borrowers that might be interested in buying raffle tickets, items or gotchis, contributing to baazaar activity
3) reinforce natural synergies between Aave and Aavegotchi

Gotchi ID: 4129
Discourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/2932/

Brought to you by the Wearables Task Force

Problem: We currently have some wearable slots where a higher rarity tier has a larger supply of wearables than a lower rarity tier:

Uncommon Body > Common Body
Mythical Eyes > Legendary Eyes
Uncommon Pet > Common Pet
Rare Eyes > Uncommon Eyes

Proposal:
For a given item slot S, and two rarity tiers H and L where H is higher rarity than L:
1.  No wearable raffles/auctions should introduce a scenario where H has a larger supply than L.
2.  In cases where H already has a larger supply than L, each raffle/auction should close the gap between H’s and L’s supply until the imbalance is resolved.

Example:
There are currently 260 mythical eyes and 200 legendary eyes, creating a supply imbalance of 60.
In the next raffle/auction:
We could drop both a legendary and mythical eye (improving the imbalance to 10 from 60)
We could drop just a legendary eye (eliminating the imbalance entirely)
We COULD NOT drop just a mythical eye (this would grow the imbalance from 60 to 110).

At a later point in time, this restriction could be lifted via another proposal.","['Yes: Enforce Relative Supplies', 'No: Leave supplies unrestricted']","[11228921.10319884, 191991.48463598863]",1

## Patch v0.1
Although the Gotchiverse is not yet live, we have identified a few areas that we believe should be adjusted before the game is released, and would like to bring these items to the community’s attention for discussion and a decision on whether or not to enact. 

To ensure no single proposed change can revert the entire batch, we originally created six separate snapshot SigProp Proposals. This CoreProp combines the successful SigProps into the first Gotchiverse Patch v0.1!

More details can be found in the Medium Post: https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-now-aavegotchidao-end-of-the-year-xp-extravaganza-ce8f9dddfaec

### **Patch 0.1a**
As we were finalizing key details such as build costs and harvesting rates for the upcoming Whitepaper, we discovered that one of our key assumptions had undervalued the amount of Alchemica in each parcel relative to total supply. The patch will increase the amount of Alchemica under each parcel to match our initial Alchemica tokens’ supplies, allocations, and emissions rates.

The SigProp for Patch 0.1a passed with the following numbers:
Yes: 13.14M GHST
No: 41.85k GHST

### **Patch 0.1b**
Although our original intention was to make boosts one-time only, it is clear that many in the community interpreted the GEO paper to mean that boosts would be replenished. This patch allows boosts to also replenish together with the parcel itself after each Great Battle.

However, unlike parcels, the replenish rate is a fixed amount that is the same per round. For example, a parcel with a “5” FUD boost receives 5 servings of FUD per boost round.

The SigProp for Patch 0.1b also passed pretty convincingly:
Yes: 10.36M GHST
No: 2.37M GHST

### **Patch 0.1c**
Even with Patch 0.1b passed, boosts will still be undervalued compared to the value the market has assigned to them, relative to a similar parcel with no boosts. Patch 0.1c proposed increasing boosts by 5x to bring the value of a boost closer to what the market is currently valuing it at. 

The SigProp for Patch 0.1c **did not pass** and **WILL NOT BE INCLUDED** in Patch v0.1:
Yes: 5.85M GHST
No: 8.04M GHST

Future SigProps may be created to address this issue separately.

### **Patch 0.1d**
The Gotchiverse Litepaper mentions that Kinship will be exchanged for a serving of Alchemica, essentially “burning” kinship. We certainly want to maintain the idea of a “kinship boost” for channeling but after thinking more deeply, we now believe there is a better way to achieve this. 

An “achievements” approach does not require depleting an Aavegotchi’s kinship. Instead, high kinship Aavegotchis will channel Alchemica at a slightly higher rate, depending on their achievement level.

The SigProp for Patch 0.1d also passed:
Yes: 12.64M GHST
No: 431.93k GHST

### **Patch 0.1e & 0.1f**
Districts did not exist as a Citaadel concept when the Litepaper was first published. That said, we have always envisioned an area or areas for Pixelcraft to develop in-depth experiences that add value to the overall game. Likewise, one of our earliest ideas, (predating the Citaadel itself!) was to reserve a town square for real time DAO voting. The idea of having a gamified governance experience was one of the very earliest ideas seeding Aavegotchi’s need for its own virtual world.

Patch 0.1e & 0.1f proposed allocating 1000 parcels each to Pixelcraft and the AavegotchiDAO in D27/D30. Both Patches passed convincingly:

Yes: 11.94M GHST / 12.14M GHST
No: 615.78k GHST / 734.92k GHST

## Conclusion
And that’s it for the first Gotchiverse Patch! Now it is up to you, the AavegotchiDAO, to decide if Patch v0.1 should be implemented or not.

Gotchi ID: 1998
Discourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/season-3-for-q1-2022/2779

Problem: 
Currently, rarity farm seasons happen sporadically and are difficult to account for in the cadence of Aavegotchi releases. It leaves investors wondering if they should hold onto their gotchis and wearables, or if they might find better ROI flipping into the next rounds. It would be desirable to have a bit of certainty / predictability for both investor sentiment and for planning purposes. 

Solution: 
When possible funding-wise, rarity farms should be a quarterly event. It would fit in with the seasonal nature we are already following, and if properly planned could be sustainable based on GBM sales in-between seasons, treasury revenue via staking and partnerships (such as the umbra bridge proposal also live now), and other streams of revenue such as DAO grants. The author of this proposal believes rarity farming is an essential part of the gotchiverse ecosystem, and something to build out and improve upon rather than scrap.

For season 3, I suggest we go back to the standard reward ratio, as was tried and tested in rarity farming season 1. 
The rookies of the similarly named rookie board are now all grown up and ready to compete with the big boys.  This would mean 70% of payouts go to the BRS leaderboard,  20% to the kinship leaderboard and 10% to the XP leaderboard. 

Ideally, we would kick the rarity farm off in mid-late January 2022; this would fit snugly into the timing of the gotchiverse release, and would position us right in the first quarter of a new fiscal year.","[""Yes, let's have season 3 in Q1"", ""No, don't have season 3""]","[10496309.629988397, 1113792.396433444]",1

GotchiID: 4895
Discourse thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/new-designated-wearable-for-guild-insignia/2118/24

[Context]

The Gotchiverse will be launching soon and guilds have started to form in preparation. One type of installation they will be able to build on their parcels is the Gotchi Lodge. With it guilds will be able to provide their members with the opportunity to participate in communal channeling.

Communal channeling is defined in the litepaper as:

""Aavegotchis can also collectively channel Alchemica when a Gotchi Lodge Installation has been built upon the REALM Parcel. In order to participate in communal channeling, the Aavegotchi must be wearing the associated Guild Insignia and be present on the REALM Parcel during the ritual. For every additional Aavegotchi participating in the Communal Channeling ritual, Alchemica will be farmed more rapidly.""

The Aavegotchi team further specified that it would use existing wearables which prompted guilds to adopt specific wearables as their insignias. From the alpha that was released regarding the lodge installation we believe those insignias would also be linked to the lodge.

[Proposition]

Add support for custom guild insignias NFTs in addition to existing wearables for participation in communal channeling

[Goals]

- Give free access to communal channeling for guild members by not requiring to buy a wearable to participate
- Remove the potential impact of the guild wearable on the gotchi BRS or abilities
- Remove the necessity to block a slot with a specific wearable to participate in communal channeling

[Options]

1. Add the possibility of holding another type of NFT in the pocket to participate in communal channeling

Benefits:
- Add a free to play option for participation in communal channeling
- Does not occupy a slot and does not affect BRS or stats
- Unique guild insignia makes it easy to upgrade or replace if necessary
- Allow for custom designs that relate closely to the guild theme and encourage creators in the community

Limitations :
- Lodge would need to support generic contracts (dev time)
- Unlimited supply means communal channeling participant number would only be limited by land surface (parcel or estate)
- Free option means users could more easily participate in more than one guild
- Potential to negatively impact wearables price if guilds massively decide to use custom insignias instead of wearables

2. Change nothing (only existing wearables can be used for communal channeling)

Benefits:
- Easier to implement (only need to support existing wearables)
- Exclusive utility for wearables which can help support the price
- Some guilds have already disclosed their chosen wearable for communal channeling (stays in line with the litepaper)

Limitations :
- Add an upfront cost to participate in communal channeling
- Make wearables more scarce and less liquid
- Finite choice of wearables (could be a limiting factor for some guilds)
- Could negatively affect BRS or stats by forcing to equip a specific wearable

With no Rookies and no Kinship burn, climbing the Kinship leaderboard will be very expensive. Despite the occasional Chad move, we won't see any significant movement. The most diligently pet H2 Gotchis made it to the tail end of the overall Kinship leaderboard in one huge tie of over 200 Gotchis that never missed a pet and never drank a potion. All those ties are broken by XP, essentially turning a large part of the Kinship leaderboard in an expansion of the XP leaderboard.
Hence, this proposal seeks to replace the Kinship Leaderboard for Season 3 of Rarity Farming with a BOOSTED Dependability Leaderboard that is tie-broken by interaction time-shift.

[Introduction]
An explanation of what dependability is can be found in the discourse thread linked below. It fixes the major issues we've seen with the Kinship leaderboard and does not require a Rookie exclusive version to give newly summoned Gotchis good chances to climb the leaderboard.

[Effect]
When we launch RF S3, Gotchis from H2 would see little to no rewards from an overall Kinship leaderboard. And as we've seen with the Rookie Kinship leaderboards, another Rookie Leaderboard for Kinship would just result in a huge number of ties, essentially turning the rookie Kinship leaderboard into a partial Rookie XP leaderboard.
At the last snapshot of RF S2, Haunt 2 Gotchis made it into the Top 400 of the Dependability leaderboard, seen on aavegotchi.pet
Using a Potion Boosted version of Dependability with time-shift as tie breaker, we'd end up with a leaderboard that is entirely based on interactions that newly summoned Gotchis of any Haunt, would be able to climb much faster than the traditional Kinship leaderboard. The exact details are explained in the discourse thread linked below.

[Goal]
To create an interaction based Leaderboard that is as fair as possible to all the different kinds of Gotchi owners.

Districts did not exist as a Citaadel concept when the Litepaper was first published. That said, we have always envisioned an area or areas for Pixelcraft to develop in-depth experiences that add value to the overall game. Likewise, one of our earliest ideas, (predating the Citaadel itself!) was to reserve a town square for real time DAO voting. The idea of having a gamified governance experience was one of the very earliest ideas seeding Aavegotchi’s need for its own virtual world. 

Perhaps this is why the thought of amending the Litepaper or publishing an official change regarding district allocations slipped through the cracks. We spoke about the Pixelcraft and DAO square areas as if they’d always existed! The idea for districts partially arose out of these two “squares” along with a combination of our development tracks reinforcing one another: gameplay, map design, auction prep, and progress with the path to smart contract executed non-playable characters (NPCs).

It was no ill intent and definitely an oversight. That said, we recognize that it is indeed a big allocation and are fine with whichever way the DAO votes on keeping or removing the 1000 parcels for Pixelcraft Studios currently assigned to District 27.

The Gotchiverse Litepaper mentions that Kinship will be exchanged for a serving of Alchemica, essentially “burning” kinship. We certainly want to maintain the idea of a “kinship boost” for channeling but after thinking more deeply, we now believe there is a better way to achieve this. An “achievements” approach does not require depleting an Aavegotchi’s kinship. Instead, high kinship Aavegotchis will channel Alchemica at a slightly higher rate, depending on their achievement level.

An achievements approach is advantageous in a number of ways. Generally, achievements based rewards are far easier to understand, since variations of such are already a common mechanic within all sorts of games. Achievements are intuitive, give players specific goals and help players easily differentiate their own play from peers. In contrast, the original idea of burning kinship for Alchemica directly doesn’t deliver on any of those mentioned benefits. Instead, you either have to burn the kinship (hurting your poor Aavegotchi) or install a parallel, in-game only, kinship score that we can see becomes quite cumbersome in implementation.

Even if 0.1b is passed, boosts will still be undervalued compared to the value the market has assigned to them, relative to a similar parcel with no boosts. We propose increasing boosts by **5X** to bring the value of a boost closer to what the market is currently valuing it at.

For example, instead of 1 FOMO Boost guaranteeing 500 FOMO to be farmed, a single FOMO boost would instead mean 2500 FOMO. While this may sound dramatic, it actually is a conservative option among the variety of choices available. A single FOMO Boost at 5X still pales in comparison to the amount of FOMO present in a single Spacious parcel.

The surface level Alchemica is a major feature of the world map and gameplay, so we think it makes sense to better align the messaging of the game design and presentation with the reality of the boosts. A boost without much meaning is not something we intended.

**While other game features can be tweaked at any point, this is the last opportunity to right imbalances that pertain to tokenomics.** It’s time to lock in the smart contracts and we think this “boost to boosts” is worthy of another draft.

Although our original intention was to make boosts one-time only, it is clear that many in the community interpreted the GEO paper to mean that boosts would be replenished. 

**This patch would allow boosts to also replenish together with the parcel itself after each Great Battle.**

BLOG POST: https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-now-aavegotchidao-end-of-the-year-xp-extravaganza-ce8f9dddfaec

However, unlike parcels, the replenish rate would be a fixed amount that is the same per round. For example, a parcel with a “5” FUD boost would receive 5 servings of FUD per boost round. 

Failing to implement boost replenishment alongside Patch 0.1a’s boosted tokenomics would result in a dramatically nerfed use case for surface level boosts, which is contrary to our world and auction map designs.

Like parcel replenishments, topping up boosts after each Great Battle does not take away from the original emissions intentions.

As we were finalizing key details such as build costs and harvesting rates for the upcoming Whitepaper, we discovered that one of our key assumptions had undervalued the amount of Alchemica in each parcel relative to total supply. The patch will increase the amount of Alchemica under each parcel to match our initial Alchemica tokens’ supplies, allocations, and emissions rates.

As you can see, the originally published chart suggests the totals are for the entirety of emissions for ACT 1 (roughly the first two years of the Gotchiverse’s existence) but in fact these emissions rates per parcel type are only for the **first Round** of ACT 1.

Patch 0.1a updates the average allocations by roughly 4x to match our original assumptions for Act 1. Note that Act 2 and Act 3 allocations will not be affected.

**Problem**
Aavegotchi aims to be one of the top Play2Earn projects in the crypto gaming space, the launch of the Gotchiverse Realm being the cornerstone to achieving this long-term goal. However, there is room for improving the short-term possibilities through seasonal gaming events. The main problem is the lack of structure and funds.

**Solution**
Before creating a dedicated Aarcade DAO, the first step to enable play2earn rewards is to create a sustainable stream of funds. A simple and low-risk solution would be to stake a portion of the main DAO treasury, such as 100k GHST, to generate FRENS. Those could be then transformed into raffle tickets and given away to mini-game players through periodic events.

**Potential risks**
Staking GHST will indirectly imply a dilution of FRENS/tickets. However, since they would be distributed via mini-game rewards, the impact should be minimal compared to the boost on engagement and appeal to new people.

**Alternatives**
Wait for the Aarcade DAO to launch and let the new committee decide how to designate funds.

Author: Moon & SynFutures Team
Gotchi ID: 3541
Discourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/provide-ghst-as-liquidity-on-the-derivatives-dex-synfutures/2664

Since Aavegotchi has gathered a lot of liquidity on Spot DEXes, it is high time for Aavegotchi to create and boost its Futures market. Derivatives markets make up the majority of global trading activity and allow users to leverage their investments. Adding GHST liquidity on SynFutures would allow people to take on leverage longs (or shorts) on the future of Aavegotchi. But why SynFutures?

**Great investors and team background**
SynFutures is backed by Polychain, Pantera, Dragonfly, Framework, Standard Crypto, Woo, and more. The team’s background is a great combination of traditional finance and DeFi. SynFutures is the only project of its kind which can support the listing of any assets by anyone in a permissionless manner (in less than 30s). The project has the potential to be the No’1 Derivatives DEX.

**Security**
Backed by solid experience from the TradFi financial engineering and DeFi protocol safety, SynFutures has many risk management features (e.g. anti-flashloan attack, EMA smoothing method, etc.) and has gone through external code audits.

**Easy to manage and start**
SynFutures supports a single token model to add liquidity which means the Aavegotchi Treasury would only have to deposit GHST instead of offering two tokens with the risk of impermanent loss. We are asking for 200k worth of GHST tokens to kickstart the pool. The liquidity could be withdrawn anytime.

**Growth Potential**
Trading volume and users are growing fast on SynFutures. For the past 3 months since ^the SynFutures Alpha launched, we reached 47k users of and $1bn+ in trading volume. All this happened without a native SynFutures token, which could attract even more users.

**Volume analysis**
Quickswap/SynFutures:
Total LPs: 150k / 40K
Total traders: 100k / 20k
Daily trading volume: $100M / $29M

SynFutures trading volume makes up ~1/3rd of QuickSwap, and the amount traders is 1/5th as big as on QuickSwap, however, the trading volume for different pairs is more concentrated. SynFutures has 108 trading pairs while QuickSwap has more than 22k pairs. For example, the daily trading volume of Matic-USDC on SynFutures closes in on around $9M, while Quickswap reaches $14M.","['Yes, add $200k in GHST', ""No, don't add any liquidity""]","[9085405.769623743, 1746573.383107188]",1

## Proposal Details

### Motivation:
Within the Aavegotchi ecosystem wearables play a vital role, whether it be boosting BRS for rarity farming, improving traits for minigames, utility in the upcoming metaverse, or just showing off. Due to the complexity of the different possible trait ranges of gotchis, and the variety of possible wearable stats, it is not an easy task to arrive at a balanced distribution of equippable items. Releasing new wearables without proper analysis can lead to duplication (and dilution) of existing items and further skew of practical applicable sets for gotchis with trait ranges in certain directions.

### Specifications:
This proposal aims to introduce a Wearables Taask Force (WTF), the idea of which arose from discussions regarding the above concerns. Akin to the FRENS Taask Force, the goal of the WTF would be to assist Pixelcraft in the analysis of the current distribution of items within the ecosystem from a slot, rarity, and trait modifiers perspective, and in how this analysis can best be applied to future items. This Taask Force would NOT have the unilateral ability to determine what and how new items are released, but would function entirely in an advisory capacity.

### Nominees:
The nominees for the Taask Force include long term community members who have a wide range of applicable skills, including statistical analysis, programming ability, strong experience in baazaar activity, and prior DAO experience. This Taask Force would greatly benefit from as many voices and perspectives as possible, so all nominations are included. 

Establishing this Taask Force would be a major step forward in creating a more balanced ecosystem and helping the AavegotchiDAO mature.

*This is the first DAO proposal to be created by the FRENS Taask Force (rebranded from FRENS Committee)*

## Proposal Details

### Motivation
Polygon has been a huge reason behind the success of Aavegotchi. Super low transaction fees paid in MATIC have enabled the team to build a game where there is lots of activity happening on-chain such as petting, bid to earn auctions, Baazaar sales, and storage of the Aavegotchi game art.

As of early September, Sushiswap started offering 2x SUSHI rewards for farming the GHST-MATIC LP pair on Sushiswap: https://app.sushi.com/farm?filter=2x

### Specification
The FRENS Taask Force recommends enabling a FRENS incentive to be paid for the GHST-MATIC LP pair on their AMM.

We recommend that the target rate of FRENS paid to the GHST-MATIC LP pair is greater than the target incentive for the GHST-ETH LP pair (120%) but lower than the target incentive for the GHST-QUICK pair (135%). 

This is because the Impermanent Loss (IL) risk for GHST-MATIC is higher compared to GHST-ETH but lower compared to GHST-QUICK. We would recommend a target rate of 130% for the GHST-MATIC LP pair.

Currently, the majority of the liquidity for GHST resides on Quickswap. 
See: https://frens-taaskforce.vercel.app/

This offers a great opportunity to move some of our liquidity over to the widely adopted Sushiswap AMM.

**A short list of notable adjustments have been made from the SigProp and are highlighted here with this update:**

- **The implementation will be slightly modified to use the available onchain data of birth block timestamp as opposed to block number**, with epoch times predetermined using the same fibonacci intervals proposed in the sigprop and the current average block time. This makes the implementation much simpler, allows for predictable timelines (since a block time denominator would be constant, as opposed to variable based on chain activity), as well as ensures the functionality of the mechanic should any potential cases of architecture or blockchain network changes occur in the future. The petting time intervals already function using real time, so a precedent for this exists.

- **The 10 BRS cap is removed**. The fibonacci intervals themselves act as a natural cap, as the time to reach further epochs approximates an exponential function. For example, it will take over 4 more years to get an additional BRS bonus (+11 total), then 6.5 years for another, then 10.5 years, etc.

- **The implementation would go live prior to the beginning of Rarity Farming Season 2**. One of the goals of aging is to provide a short term buffer to the effects of statistical variance once a new haunt is released. For Haunt 1's to be able to experience any of this benefit at all, the implementation must go live as soon as possible, as by the middle of season 2 H2's will already be mostly caught up to the H1 bonus, with only a 1-2 BRS difference.

# AGIP13 - Aavegotchi Aging Mechanic

This sigprop proposes a small BRS boost to gotchis as they age, to counteract statistical variance between haunts and reward long term engagement.

## Problem
As new haunts are released, whether or not they include a bug fix that impacts gotchi trait generation, a strong dilution of existing high BRS gotchis occurs. Due to the nature of rarity farming and its rewards, this dilution is exclusively felt by those who invested heavily into older haunts, and who may not have the desire to sell due to emotional attachment, the means to invest more, or the ability to ""flip"" their way (due to local tax laws) into higher BRS gotchis from the newer haunts. Furthermore, very significant statistical variance can occur in new haunts, making it near impossible to make long term financial decisions, as the variance can render previous haunt gotchis all but obsolete. This leaves far too much entirely up to ""luck"".

## Solution
The Aging Mechanic is a proposal, initially introduced by Tistou on discord, that is designed to address all of the above mentioned issues, as well as create an interesting new dynamic of Aavegotchis that can be built upon in the future (age limits for activities, wearables, new appearance qualities, etc). It provides a buffer of approximately 6 months during which older gotchis have a BRS boost over newly summoned gotchis. As newly summoned gotchis age, they quickly begin to catch up to their older counterparts.

In the spirit of using numbers occurring in nature, the formula is modeled after the Fibonacci numbers x 1 million, but replacing the first 0 with a 1 to better fit the use case. Specifically, the first 10 Fibonacci numbers (replacing the first 0) are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, the sum of which is 89. Following this formula would mean +1 BRS after 1 million blocks, then another +1 BRS after 2 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 3 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 5 million blocks, …, up to a final sum of +10 BRS after 89 million blocks (approx 6.5 years using average block time of 2.3 seconds - the average since May 1st).

List of first 10 epochs (cumulative BRS boost -> # of blocks elapsed since birth):

+1 -> 1 million
+2 -> 2 million
+3 -> 3 million
+4 -> 5 million
+5 -> 8 million
+6 -> 13 million
+7 -> 21 million
+8 -> 34 million
+9 -> 55 million
+10 -> 89 million

This solution provides for a quicker boost in the first few epochs of age, and greatly flattens over time to avoid anything too OP and allow more recently summoned gotchis to eventually catch up to within a 1 BRS boost of their older and wiser brethren. It incentivizes opening and summoning portals as opposed to sitting on them, both boosting the in-game economy as well as the scarcity of those that are still chosen to remain closed. Most of all, it is a fair system that benefits no one haunt over any other, and simply rewards long term engagement, while counteracting the effects of sudden and aggressive dilution like we are currently witnessing.","['Yes, implement aging incentives', 'No, do not implement right now']","[12891012.46865508, 786942.3948973462]",1

Super low transaction fees paid in MATIC have enabled the team to build a game where there is lots of activity happening onchain such as petting, bid to earn auctions, Baazaar sales, and the game art for Aavegotchis with sideviews all stored onchain.

As of early September, Sushiswap started offering 2x SUSHI rewards for farming the GHST-MATIC LP pair on Sushiswap.

https://app.sushi.com/farm?filter=2x 

The FRENS Taaskforce recommends enabling a FRENS incentive to be paid for the GHST-MATIC LP pair on Sushiswap.

We recommend the target rate of FRENS that should be paid to the GHST-MATIC LP pair should be greater than the target incentive for the GHST-WETH LP pair (120%) but lower than the target incentive for the GHST-QUICK pair (135%).

This is because the impermanent loss risk for GHST-MATIC is higher compared to GHST-WETH but lower compared to GHST-QUICK. We would recommend a target rate of 130% for the GHST-MATIC LP pair.

Currently, the majority of the liquidity for GHST resides on Quickswap. See: https://frens-taaskforce.vercel.app/

This offers a great opportunity to spread some of the liquidity over to the widely adopted LP platform on Polygon Sushiswap and reduce our dependence on Quickswap.","['Yes, Give GHST-MATIC FRENS', ""No, Don't Give GHST-MATIC FRENS""]","[10115579.353925752, 420276.7692192588]",1

Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128

Problem
---
Aavegotchi aims to be one of the top Play2Earn projects in the crypto gaming space, being the launch of the Gotchiverse Realm the cornerstone to achieving this long-term goal. However, there is room for improving the short-term possibilities through seasonal gaming events. The main problem is the lack of structure and funds.

Solution
---
Before creating a dedicated Aarcade DAO, the first step to enable play2earn rewards is to create a sustainable stream of funds. A simple and low-risk solution would be to stake a portion of the main DAO tresury, such as 100k GHST, to generate FRENS. Those could be then transformed into raffle tickets and given away to mini-game players through periodic events.

Potential risks
---
Staking GHST will indirectly imply a dilution of FRENS/tickets. However,  since they would be distributed via mini-game rewards, the impact should be minimal compared to the boost on engagement and appeal to new people.

Alternatives
---
Wait for the Aarcade DAO to launch and let the new committee decide how to designate funds. However, this alternative option would mean loosing precious time to generate more attractive rewards.

Gotchi ID: 15560
Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introduction-of-an-aging-mechanic-for-brs/2267


This sigprop proposes a small BRS boost to gotchis as they age, to counteract statistical variance between haunts and reward long term engagement. 


**Problem**
As new haunts are released, whether or not they include a bug fix that impacts gotchi trait generation, a strong dilution of existing high BRS gotchis occurs. Due to the nature of rarity farming and its rewards, this dilution is exclusively felt by those who invested heavily into older haunts, and who may not have the desire to sell due to emotional attachment, the means to invest more, or the ability to ""flip"" their way (due to local tax laws) into higher BRS gotchis from the newer haunts. Furthermore, very significant statistical variance can occur in new haunts, making it near impossible to make long term financial decisions, as the variance can render previous haunt gotchis all but obsolete. This leaves far too much entirely up to ""luck"".


**Solution**
The Aging Mechanic is a proposal, initially introduced by Tistou on discord, that is designed to address all of the above mentioned issues, as well as create an interesting new dynamic of aavegotchis that can be built upon in the future (age limits for activities, wearables, new appearance qualities, etc). It provides a buffer of approximately 6 months during which older gotchis have a BRS boost over newly summoned gotchis. As newly summoned gotchis age, they quickly begin to catch up to their older counterparts, with everyone maxing out at a 10 BRS boost after approximately 6.5 - 7 years. 

In the spirit of using numbers occurring in nature, the formula is modeled after the Fibonacci numbers x 1 million, but replacing the first 0 with a 1 to better fit the use case. Specifically, the first 10 Fibonacci numbers (replacing the first 0) are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, the sum of which is 89. Following this formula would mean +1 BRS after 1 million blocks, then another +1 BRS after 2 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 3 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 5 million blocks, …, up to a final sum of +10 BRS after 89 million blocks (approx 6.5 years using average block time of 2.3 seconds - the average since May 1st). Full list (cumulative BRS boost -> # of blocks elapsed since birth):

+1  -> 1 million 
+2  -> 2 million
+3  -> 3 million
+4  -> 5 million
+5  -> 8 million
+6  -> 13 million
+7  -> 21 million
+8  -> 34 million
+9  -> 55 million
+10 -> 89 million


This solution provides for a quicker boost in the first few epochs of age, and greatly flattens over time to avoid anything too OP and allow more recently summoned gotchis to catch up to their older and wiser brethren. It incentivizes opening and summoning portals as opposed to sitting on them, both boosting the in-game economy as well as the scarcity of those that are still chosen to remain closed. Most of all, it is a fair system that benefits no one haunt over any other, and simply rewards long term engagement, while counteracting the effects of sudden and aggressive dilution like we are currently witnessing.

All players should have the opportunity to experience and play to earn some XP. For the upcoming Realm this should be done via Realm Aadventures and Realm Tutorial Adventures. 

XP should be rewarded to players for players who complete Realm Tutorial Aadventures and ordinary Realm Aadventures. The purpose of the Realm Tutorial Aadventure is to engage and learn how to interact with the Aavegotchi Realm.

A Realm Aadventure are metaverse adventures, commonly known in video games as in-game quests. Players are to be guided by a mix of non-playable characters, playable characters, prompts, Web3 tools, video game assets for an immersive experience. The activities and objectives of each Aadventure will vary, but they should be like other metaverses and video game MMORPGs and RPGs. An example is completing a dungeon, creating a potion, or using the chatbox for the first time. Aadventures completion history are to be stored with the Aavegotchi.

Realm Tutorial Aadventures should be longer lasting with the intention of teaching mechanics of Aavegotchi ecosystem and the realm. Ordinary Aadventures can be short, longer lasting, or seasonal. They are differentiated from Tutorial Aadventures because they guide users/players into participating in the storyline, spending time in the realm, and/or community building.

XP should be rewarded through Realm Aadventures or Realm Tutorial Aadventures via this proposal should total no more than 100 XP per Aavegotchi. No individual Aadventure via this proposal may reward Aavegotchis with more than 10 XP.","['Add Realm Aadventures; Accept', 'Do Nothing; Reject']","[7280297.11468496, 50234.750953538976]",1

65,QmbyTP2pemJae9XbX8UNWEydhdTKw9xCFR7SFTKeowXizo,"""Goodie Bags"" (Portals) for Wearables","I've thought it would be interesting to use Chainlink VRF and probabilities to generate items, instead of a set number per release. 

The initial thought was to have what I'm calling a ""Goodie Bag"" of Gotchi wearables-- what inside isn't known until opened. Each Goodie Bag would contain 5 wearables of varying rarity. Unlike portals where you have to choose one Gotchi, i was hopeful all 5 wearables would be claimable. There could be a ""minimum included rarity"" so that all 5 items are not commons.

There's a couple ways to do this through probabilities-- using a ""stacked deck"" approach, where there are 500 of ""X"" uncommon items, scattered throughout each of the 1000 bags. There will always be 500 of item ""X"" and as the packs are opened, the probability of earning X in a bag can vary. Chainlink could be used to determine which goodie bags each wearable goes into.

P( ""X"" | 0 bags opened) = 500/5000 =10% (1000 bags*5 wearables per bag) 
P( ""X"" | 500 bags opened, 300 with X) = 200/500 = 40%
P( ""X"" | 500 bags opened, 100 with X) = 400/500 = 80%

Another would be to have set probabilities for each item, goodie bag, or even rarity type, and have a ""Expected quantity"" of items based on the number of goodie bags released. If 1000 bags (5000 potential items) were released, we can expect to see 10% of all items be item ""X"", or about 500. If each wearable were unique in a bag (cannot receive 2 ""X"" in same bag) then the expected qty would be 100 of item X. 

PER ITEM probability
Each item has a set probability, could be designed to receive the same item multiple times in a bag, or prevent it!

Chainlink would be used to determine the probability of each item being crafted upon goodie bag opening. 

Essentially, the concept of having wearable drops within a ""goodie bag"" has massive potential. Using probability entirely, there's a chance for ONLY ONE ITEM TO BE CREATED. If using a stacked deck, bazaar prices could go craazy if the high rarity items haven't been pulled! Requiring people to choose one or some of the items could add even further market complexities! The possibilities are endless FRENS!

Gotchi ID: 3541

Discourse Thread (Candidates): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/frens-committee-applications/1944

**Problem**
To incentivize liquidity on QuickSwap, you can earn additional FRENS rewards for staking Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens on the Aavegotchi website. Depending on the risk of Impermanent Loss (IL) these numbers can vary, originally it was +35% for GHST-QUICK, +20% for GHST-ETH and +10% for GHST-USDC. Because the rates have to be manually adjusted and prices have moved quite a bit since this was introduced, the FRENS rewards are off by quite a lot; GHST-QUICK is at around +90%, while GHST-USDC earns -10%.

**Solution**
Quoted from coderdan:
""There has been talk of setting up committees for managing certain parts of Aavegotchi, and I believe this could be an interesting candidate for such a committee. Right now we only have two [now three] pairs incentivized by FRENS, but this could change in the future.”

The “committee” could be a multisig of at least nine (maybe up to fifteen) members with strong reputation in the community and high Gotchi dependability counters. At its core, this Liquidity Committee would monitor and adjust FRENS rates to keep in check with the pre-determined rate, by performing contract calls to the GHST Staking contracts only available to a new “rateManager” role created for the committee.""

For now the committee should just have one job - keeping the FRENS rates up-to-date. In the future this could be extended to partnerships, monitoring of FRENS inflation, etc.

**Candidates**
Two weeks ago we created a Discourse thread (linked above) for interested parties to apply as candidates. Since then 11 people have applied. All candidates have been members of the community for a while and put forward good reasons as to why they should be chosen. As this is still within the range of 9-15, the easiest way would be to form the committee with all applicants.

So now it's up to you, AavegotchiDAO. Should we take this step in further decentralizing Aavegotchi and put the FRENS rate into the hands of:

74,QmYDWPc92JgF2pXzRFttuiCkhw4WExfTwoajf2yUx84Ghh,Should Venly wearables be auctioned on their own before haunt 2,"Author: pgendreau#0811 
Gotchi ID: 4895

Context: 
The Venly wearables drop was supposed to happen on the 29th of July but there was some infrastructure issues and the drop had to be cancelled after only a few of the items were released (https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/784303575593517087/870325906319757342).  It was decided between Venly and Pixelcraft that it would be better to auction the rest of the wearables through the GBM auction system. The actual plan is to auction them at the same time as the Haunt 2 portals. Some members of the community feel it would be better to hold a separate auction prior to the Haunt 2 release.

Proposition:
Organise a standalone event to auction the remaining Venly wearables on their own before the Haunt 2 auction. 

PROS:
- Allow new users to get a feel for the GBM auction process before Haunt 2
- Put the focus on the new set and allow for better price discovery
- Create a more dynamic market for GHST ahead of Haunt 2 auction
- Simpler capital allocation for users and opportunity to reuse incentives

CONS:
- More work for Pixelcraft team to organise a second event on short notice
- New users may not have an aavegotchi yet to equip wearables","['Yes, wearables before haunt 2', 'No, wearables with haunt 2']","[3060019.0274324184, 927370.7627332556]",1

***Problem being addressed:***
Accessibility to the Aavegotchi platform. Currently Aavegotchis are limited by a maximum possible 10,000 because only that many Haunt 1 Portals exist. This makes acquiring a first Aavegotchi cost prohibitive. a second Haunt of 15,000 more Portals, we aim to address this problem while respecting unique, collectible aspects of Haunt 1 Aavegotchis.

Our vision is for far wider adoption of playable NFTs, and the first step to achieving that means leaving the scarcity memes behind and focusing on being able to offer meaningfully unique experiences to more people.

**Solution:**
We are suggesting it is the right time to introduce a second Haunt of 15,000 more Portals in Haunt 2. We aim to address the accessibility problem while respecting unique, collectible aspects of Haunt 1 Aavegotchis.

So today, we are launching the Haunt 2 CoreProp, open for voting on this extremely important topic over the next 7 days. The proposal maintains all of the original Haunt 2 SigProp’s key details with one new bit of added langauge:

***CoreProp Amendment 1/1***

Because rarity farming seasons are primarily funded by Portal NFT sales, the H2 SigProp needed to address reward distribution adjustments. This CoreProp maintains the same cap increase (Season 1’s 1.4 million GHST increased to 2 million GHST) but with one explicit caveat:

The rewards cap is completely amendable by the DAO and we encourage more proposals for what the Season 2 revenue cap should be (before or after any Haunt 2 auction). 

Many community members have expressed that they would prefer the Rarity Farming Rewards Cap to be decided later, so we are honoring that by encouraging the community to put forth some Signal Proposals on this issue. The DAO is encouraged to deliver an AGIP that can change this cap.

*** Unchanged Haunt 2 Proposal Details ***

How many Portals?
--- 15,000 Portals (each Portal summons one Aavegotchi)
--- Each Portal contains 10 potential Aavegotchis
Stake what tokens to summon?
--- Polygon Aave.com amTokens
What Spirit Forces are completely new?
--- WBTC, MATIC and WETH designs + GHST (pending listing on Aave.com)
How will Portals be distributed?
--- 80% will be listed in a GBM bid-to-earn style Aauction
--- 20% will be raffled
How does Haunt 2 relate to Season 2 of Rarity Farming?
--- 40% of total Portal revenue will fund the Rarity Farming rewards pool.
--- 2 new “Rookie Season” leaderboards will be added for Kinship and XP (see below)
--- Season 2 reward distribution caps at a maximum 2 Million GHST
--- Any additional GHST in the pool will be reserved and staked to earn more for future seasons.
--- Top 5000 in each of the five categories will farm GHST

**There are key changes since the last time we voted regarding a potential Haunt 2:**
- Our home network, Polygon, has exploded in popularity.
- Significant progress on the Pixelcraft Studios dev roadmap.
- The release of details regarding The Gotchiverse Realm.
- A new NFT drop method, powered by bid-to-earn mechanics.

**There are specific differences between H1 and H2 Aavegotchis**
- Exclusive, non-transferable H1 backgrounds for all H1 gotchis
- Two eye shape traits reserved exclusively for H1
- Two new eye shapes added for H2

**PROS:**
- Greatly increases accessibility
- Drives interest preceding the launch of REALM
- Demonstrates a successful ""supply by consensus"" model
- Introduces new mechanics re. Rarity Farming

**CONS:**
- Risk is inherent to each in every product launch
- Potential exists to misjudge supply and demand
- Certain collectors strategies may not align with this approach
- H2 Revenue Distribution

The original Haunt had a revenue split that included a massive 33% GHST token burn (along with 40% player rewards, 17% Pixelcraft income and 10% DAO funding). In retrospect, we found that such a significant burn was not the best use of capital. Lessons learned include:

Dampened effect:
The unique nature of GHST token (asset backed by DAI and minting/burning on a bonding curve) means burning has minimal impact on volatility.

Opportunity costs:
This massive amount of value burned could have been put to work on behalf of Aavegotchi. In one example, a certain leading exchange offers an OTC desk product to high net worth individuals and institutional investors. We were approached to have GHST offered in their catalog, but in order to do so, a minimum stake north of 1 million GHST would be required. By providing that GHST, we would be exposing our token to larger scale investors and also could earn a decent percentage return for simply providing the tokens on a long term loaned basis (not selling them). If we hadn’t just lit our GHST on fire, we would have had the reserves to execute on this sort of opportunity.

War chest:
Finally, Pixelcraft and AavegotchiDAO are extremely ambitious organizations facing their own unique challenges in regulations, taxation, and scaling. For example, potential taxation on a 33% token burn represents a significant risk factor for Pixelcraft Studios. Even if sailing is smooth, a strong war chest helps both Pixelcraft and the DAO continue healthy growth while remaining independent. While flexible and open to strategic partners, we’d rather not have to ever be in a position where we feel we must sell out to outside parties.

Marketing campaigns:
Ticket giveaways are a great way to drum up interest in Aavegotchi, but since we are committed to not “pre-minting” any tickets, they must be earned by staking just like everyone else. Having more GHST to stake allows us to generate more tickets which can be used for strategic marketing campaigns and airdrops to help grow the #GotchiGang!

These are some of the main reasons we are advocating for an adjustment to the virtuous cycle to go along with any new Haunt being implemented. The new breakdown greatly reduces the burn while increasing distribution to Pixelcraft Studios and AavegotchiDAO as well. We believe the 40% rewards pool has proven very successful and should remain the same. 

***The proposed distribution goes as follows:***
Rewards pool = 40%
Pixelcraft Studios = 40%
AavegotchiDAO = 15%
GHST burn = 5%

***In conclusion***
The growth of the Gotchi economy means that digital scarcity has its place but is not the ultimate goal. We are offering a carefully balanced approach with unique attributes retained for Haunt 1 Aavegotchis while also expanding accessibility and user growth as we barrel toward The Gotchiverse Realm and wider awareness and adoption of playable NFTs and DeFi.

Gotchi ID: 3541
Discourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/committee-idea-liquidity-managers-for-managing-the-frens-s-of-liquidity-pairs/1905
Discourse Thread (Candidates): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/frens-committee-applications/1944

**Problem**
To incentivize liquidity on QuickSwap, you can earn additional FRENS rewards for staking Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens on the Aavegotchi website. Depending on the risk of Impermanent Loss (IL) these numbers can vary, originally it was +35% for GHST-QUICK, +20% for GHST-ETH and +10% for GHST-USDC. Because the rates have to be manually adjusted and prices have moved quite a bit since this was introduced, the FRENS rewards are off by quite a lot; GHST-QUICK is at around +90%, while GHST-USDC earns -10%.

**Solution**
Quoted from coderdan: 
""There has been talk of setting up committees for managing certain parts of Aavegotchi, and I believe this could be an interesting candidate for such a committee. Right now we only have two [now three] pairs incentivized by FRENS, but this could change in the future.

The “committee” could be a multisig of at least nine (maybe up to fifteen) members with strong reputation in the community and high Gotchi dependability counters. At its core, this Liquidity Committee would monitor and adjust FRENS rates to keep in check with the pre-determined rate, by performing contract calls to the GHST Staking contracts only available to a new “rateManager” role created for the committee.""

For now the committee should just have one job - keeping the FRENS rates up-to-date. In the future this could be extended to partnerships, monitoring of FRENS inflation, etc. 

**Candidates**
Two weeks ago we created a Discourse thread (linked above) for interested parties to apply as candidates. Since then 11 people have applied. All candidates have been members of the community for a while and put forward good reasons as to why they should be chosen. As this is still within the range of 9-15, the easiest way would be to form the committee with all applicants.

So now it's up to you, AavegotchiDAO. Should we take this step in further decentralizing Aavegotchi and put the FRENS rate into the hands of:

The discussions at dao.aavegotchi.com and our Discord have heavily informed the details contained in this Signal Proposal. This vote will last one week and, if passed, we will upgrade to one more round of voting with a binding Core Proposal (CoreProp).

Without further ado, let’s lay out the SigProp’s details and also clarify some key points in regards to portal sales revenue sharing and how Haunt 2 relates to Rarity Farming Season 2.

***Haunt 2 Proposal Details***

**How many Portals?**
--- 15,000 Portals (each Portal summons one Aavegotchi)
--- Each Portal contains 10 potential Aavegotchis
**Stake what tokens to summon?**
--- Polygon Aave.com amTokens
**What Spirit Forces are completely new?**

--- 40% of total Portal revenue will fund the Rarity Farming rewards pool.
--- 2 new “Rookie Season” leaderboards will be added for Kinship and XP (see below)
--- Season 2 reward distribution caps at a maximum 2 Million GHST
--- Any additional GHST in the pool will be reserved and staked to earn more for future seasons.
--- Top 5000 in each of the five categories will farm GHST

***Key changes since the last time we voted regarding a potential Haunt 2:***

- Our hometown, Polygon has exploded in popularity.
- Significant progress on the Pixelcraft Studios dev roadmap.
- The release of details regarding The Gotchiverse Realm.
- A new NFT drop method, powered by bid-to-earn mechanics.

***Specific differences between H1 and H2 Aavegotchis***
- Exclusive, non-transferable H1 backgrounds for all H1 gotchis
- Two eye shape traits reserved exclusively for H1
- Two new eye shapes added for H2

***PROS:***
- Greatly increases accessibility
- Drives interest preceding the launch of REALM
- Demonstrates a successful ""supply by consensus"" model
- Introduces new mechanics re. Rarity Farming

***CONS:***
- Risk is inherent to each in every product launch
- Potential exists to misjudge supply and demand
- Certain collectors strategies may not align with this approach


***H2 Revenue Distribution***
The original Haunt had a revenue split that included a massive 33% GHST token burn (along with 40% player rewards, 17% Pixelcraft income and 10% DAO funding). In retrospect, we as the core team found such a significant burn was not the best use of capital. Lessons learned include:

**Dampened effect:**
The unique nature of GHST token (asset backed by DAI and minting/burning on a bonding curve) means burning has minimal impact on volatility.

**Opportunity costs:**

We were approached to have GHST offered in their catalog, but in order to do so, a minimum stake north of 1 million GHST would be required. By providing that GHST, we would be exposing our token to larger scale investors and also could earn a decent percentage return for simply providing the tokens on a long term loaned basis (not selling them). If we hadn’t just lit our GHST on fire, we would have had the reserves to execute on this sort of opportunity.

**War chest:**
Finally, Pixelcraft and AavegotchiDAO are extremely ambitious organizations facing their own unique challenges in regulations, taxation, and scaling. For example, potential taxation on a 33% token burn represents a significant risk factor for Pixelcraft Studios. Even if sailing is smooth, a strong war chest helps both Pixelcraft and the DAO continue healthy growth while remaining independent. While flexible and open to strategic partners, we’d rather not have to ever be in a position where we feel we must sell out to outside parties.

**Marketing campaigns:**
Ticket giveaways are a great way to drum up interest in Aavegotchi, but since we are committed to not “pre-minting” any tickets, they must be earned by staking just like everyone else. Having more GHST to stake allows us to generate more tickets which can be used for strategic marketing campaigns and airdrops to help grow the #GotchiGang!

These are some of the main reasons we are advocating for an adjustment to the virtuous cycle to go along with any new Haunt being implemented. The new breakdown greatly reduces the burn while increasing distribution to Pixelcraft Studios and AavegotchiDAO as well. We believe the 40% rewards pool has proven very successful and should remain the same. The proposed distribution goes as follows:

Rewards pool = 40%
Pixelcraft Studios = 40%
AavegotchiDAO = 15%
GHST burn = 5%

***Conclusion, time to vote!***
The conversation for this SigProp will continue in a new SigProp dedicated dao.aavegotchi.com thread. The vote is set to last for 7 days. Upon reaching quorum and a majority of support, we will see the contents of the vote upgraded to a binding Core Proposal AGIP11. If the vote fails to reach quorum or reach consensus, we will again table Haunt 2 until further notice. It would likely not come up again until some time in Q3 or even later depending on circumstances and the signals received by the wider community.

To conclude, we are aiming for wider adoption and so moving beyond the focus on scarcity of Aavegotchis. This is all carefully balanced with unique attributes retained for Haunt 1 Aavegotchis and the momentum building toward The Gotchiverse Realm and more.

Gotchi ID: 3433
Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/liquidity-expansion-options-honeyswap/1845

** PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED: **
Liquidity for GHST pairs on Quickswap is dropping as QUICK rewards are spread across more pools.

** SOLUTION: **
The 1hive DAO is expanding its Honeyswap exchange from xDAI to Polygon.  Honeyswap is live at: https://app.honeyswap.org/ 

As part of this expansion, they will be incentivizing Polygon trading pairs with their pComb token, including the wETH-GHST pair.  See their wiki at: https://wiki.1hive.org/projects/honeyswap/honeyswap-on-polygon
Honeyswap farms on xDAI currently yield 10% (USDC pair) to 460% (xComb pair).

To incentivize the growth of this liquidity pool, I propose that we award FRENS to stakers in the wETH-GHST pair at Honeyswap at a rate of approximately 1.2x the rate of staking GHST alone.  This rate is between the 1.1x for GHST-USDC and 1.33x for GHST-QUICK available from Quickswap staking.

Discussions between Pixelcraft and 1hive developers will be required to determine whether the mechanism for staking is similar to Quickswap (deposit liquidity, stake LP at Aavegotchi, then stake Aavegotchi receipts at exchange for rewards) 

** PROS: **
- Incentives for staking GHST at Honeyswap will increase liquidity available for GHST traders.
- wETH-GHST pair will have a 0.15% trading fee (instead of 0.30% for Quickswap pairs)
- Traders interested in ETH long-term can hold ETH-based pair instead of USDC stablecoin or QUICK speculative token.
- Visibility of Aavegotchi and FRENS rewards to the active 1hive DAO community with a compatible mindset

** CONS: **
- Additional FRENS emissions makes each FREN less valuable
- Potential fragmentation of GHST liquidity with many incentivized GHST pairs
- Additional effort by Pixelcraft to setup the rewards mechanism
- Future value of pComb along with Honeyswap's potential for success on Polygon is unknown.  Currently, Honeyswap has $13M TVL on xDAI; Quickswap has $1.3B TVL.

This proposal was originally described on the DAO forum as an either/or proposition between Honeyswap and Dinoswap. However, discussion and the poll seemed to favor considering each partnership separately.

** IN SUMMARY, this proposal has:
More liquidity for GHST and more visibility for Aavegotchi by incentivizing the wETH-GHST pool at Honeyswap with FRENS.","['Award FRENS to stakers at 1hive', 'No MOAR FRENS!']","[653821.2614165831, 868754.7997335583]",0

Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/ghst-liquidity-rewards-on-new-launch-pixelcraft-dao-collaboration/1804

## Problem being addressed:
Some community members are worried about the waning liquidity of GHST on Quickswap and their gradually decreasing LP rewards.

View the detailed proposal at the Discourse Thread linked above.

## Solution:
Rather than simply allocating more liquidity to the pool, we are considering partnering with a soon to launch liquidity aggregator called DinoSwap. The terms include a total of 200k USD worth of GHST tokens to be allocated to their incentivized “extinction pools”, the details of which are fleshed out below.


## Update:
Since this proposal's original SigProp, we have seen DinoSwap publish their first blog post, activate their Twitter (@dinoswapHQ), launch their Telegram channels (https://t.me/DinoSwapOfficial and announcements channel https://t.me/DinoSwapAnn) and be copied by fake scammer knockoffs. 

**NOTE: No DinoSwap tokens have been minted yet!**

We are expecting their team to publish more news throughout this week and have a verbal agreement for an AMA to take place before the conclusion of this CoreProp. It is completely reasonable to withhold casting any vote on this proposal before that AMA takes place. Once we have a date and time confirmed, its details will be plastered all over our various socials. 

## Proposal:
I am proposing that Pixelcraft Studios and AavegotchiDAO each contribute 100k USD worth of GHST to partner with DinoSwap during their launch window. For the $200,000 of GHST tokens provided, DinoSwap will be providing approximately $2,000,000 in DINO rewards over a 3 month period to stkGHST-WETH LPs on QuickSwap.

This particular arrangement offers an asymmetric risk/reward scenario: consider, if the DAO foregoes this and instead puts up 100K worth of GHST as just normal liquidity, then we've got 100K more liquidity in an already existing pair's pool. Not terrible, but not great either.

The opportunity here is that this 100K may lead to much more than 100K in liquidity for a newly bootstrapped GHST-WETH pair. Maybe 1M, maybe 10M, or maybe something much lower. It's hard to say, but the potential is there, and that's why this proposition is worth the DAO's consideration.

After over a month of vetting by Pixelcraft, we believe the upside (big increase in liquidity, potentially valuable DINO rewards for LPs) significantly outweighs the downside (spending 100K GHST for the DAO, 100K for Pixelcraft).

A quick check of https://aavegotchi.com/treasury shows that DAO treasury currently sits near 870k DAI and 515k GHST.

**PROS:**

* Potentially significant increases for GHST liquidity demand.
* Wider exposure of GHST to the fast growing Polygon user base and users of DinoSwap.
* Bootstrapping a new, third major liquidity pair in GHST-WETH.

**CONS:**
* DinoSwap is a new, untested (but audited by Certik) product that may not live up to the hype.
* The $200K in GHST provided is going into an “extinction pool”, which means it will be consumed by yield farmers participating in liquidity mining on Quickswap, in exchange for the new DINO token (whose value is unknown).
* The assorted risks of the unknown and opportunity cost.

Note, Pixelcraft would also integrate FRENS rewards for the GHST-WETH liquidity providers, in order to maximize the LPs participation in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.

The exact percentage of FRENS rewards can be discussed, but given WETH’s volatility it would likely be greater than our USDC rewards but less than the QUICK pair.

**In summary, this proposal has:**
* Pixelcraft Studios contributing 100k USD worth of GHST (taken from our monthly 50K tap allocation) while
* AavegotchiDAO treasury matches with another 100k USD worth of GHST.

**Vote Duration:** 7 days

## Proposal Details

As AavegotchiDAO progresses and more community involvement is achieved, deficiencies in capturing the ""true will of the people"" have been observed via reduced voting power after participation by core users in the ecosystem.

While #AGIP8 addresses granting Gotchis with voting power, this CoreProp is related exclusively to the topic of granting wearables with fixed voting power values.

There is no need to standardize value or voting power for each wearable in this process, as the work was already done when establishing base values for wearables.

We hereby propose to grant voting power moving forward for all wearables owned by an individual wallet address (or Aavegotchi) under the same ratios as base shop prices:

Common: +5 GHST
Uncommon: +10 GHST
Rare: +100 GHST
Legendary: +300 GHST
Mythical: +2000 GHST
Godlike: +10000 GHST

Implementation of this proposal would facilitate the passing of signal and core proposals, while fostering a sense of community involvement for core users.","['Yes, give Wearables voting power', 'No voting power for Wearables']","[3233683.854280078, 799899.1269450154]",1

**Gotchi ID:** 4563
**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/ghst-liquidity-rewards-on-new-launch-pixelcraft-dao-collaboration/1804

## Problem being addressed: ## 
Some community members are worried about the waning liquidity of GHST on Quickswap and their gradually decreasing LP rewards. 

*View the detailed proposal at the Discourse Thread linked above.* 

## Solution: ##
Rather than simply allocating more liquidity to the pool, we are considering partnering with a soon to launch liquidity aggregator called DinoSwap.  They are currently in stealth mode, but will be live on Polygon by the end of June. While we wait for more details to be made public, we can confirm DinoSwap is backed by known VC funds and launching with a short list of reputable projects partnering in the truest sense (each contributing 200k USD worth of their own tokens to one asset sided pools called ""extinction pools"").

Given the problem above, I am proposing that Pixelcraft Studios and AavegotchiDAO each contribute 100k USD worth of GHST to partner with DinoSwap during their launch window. For the $200,000 of GHST tokens provided, DinoSwap will be providing approximately $2,000,000 in DINO rewards over a 3 month period to stkGHST-WETH LPs on QuickSwap. 

This particular arrangement offers an asymmetric risk/reward scenario: consider, if the DAO foregoes this and instead puts up 100K worth of GHST as just normal liquidity, then we've got 100K more liquidity in an already existing pair's pool. Not terrible, but not great either. 

The opportunity here is that this 100K may lead to much more than 100K in liquidity for a newly bootstrapped GHST-WETH pair. Maybe 1M, maybe 10M, or maybe something much lower. It's hard to say, but the potential is there, and that's why this proposition is worth the DAO's consideration. 

After over a month of vetting by Pixelcraft, we believe the upside (big increase in liquidity, potentially valuable DINO rewards for LPs) significantly outweighs the downside (spending 100K GHST for the DAO, 100K for Pixelcraft).

A quick check of https://aavegotchi.com/treasury shows that DAO treasury currently sits near 870k DAI and 515k GHST.

** PROS: **
- Potentially significant increases for GHST liquidity demand.
- Wider exposure of GHST to the fast growing Polygon user base and users of DinoSwap.
- Bootstrapping a new, third major liquidity pair in GHST-WETH.

** CONS: **
- DinoSwap is a new, untested (but audited by Certik) product that may not live up to the hype.
- The $200K in GHST provided is going into an “extinction pool”, which means it will be consumed by yield farmers participating in liquidity mining on Quickswap, in exchange for the new DINO token (whose value is unknown).
- The assorted risks of the unknown and opportunity cost.

Note, Pixelcraft would also integrate FRENS rewards for the GHST-WETH liquidity providers, in order to maximize the LPs participation in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.

The exact percentage of FRENS rewards can be discussed, but given WETH’s volatility it would likely be greater than our USDC rewards but less than the QUICK pair.

Sacrificed Gotchis should be able to be revived by sacrificing multiple (exact amount to be determined) other Gotchis.
Sacrificed Gotchi IDs should redirect to a GrAAVEyard.

[Introduction]
When accessing the profile of a sacrificed Gotchi, it currently says ""This Aavegotchi hasn't been claimed yet!"". Here is an example:
https://aavegotchi.com/gotchi/107
I propose that, instead, these URLs redirect to a GrAAVEyard, with little tombstones that have the Gotchi IDs on them.
When clicking on one of the tombstones, you should be able to revive that Gotchi ID by sacrificing multiple of your Gotchis (between two and four; exact number is yet to be determined).

[Effect]
The revived Gotchi will have:
Traits: Random (like a portal with just one Gotchi)
Kinship: 50 (or maybe even higher, since you sacrificed to revive them)
XP: Sum of the sacrificed Gotchi's XP
Collateral type: Random 
Badges: Resurrected badge.
The resurrected badge should be a tier badge. If all the Gotchis you sacrificed to revive a Gotchi had a resurrected badge, the revived Gotchi would get the next tier badge.
Example names: Tier 1: Resurrected badge. Tier 2: Undying badge Tier 3: Immortal badge.
Example scenarios:
In case two Gotchis need to be sacrificed to revive: You would need to sacrifice 8 Gotchis in total to get a Tier 3 badge.
In case three Gotchis need to be sacrificed to revive: You would need to sacrifice 27 Gotchis in total to get a Tier 3 badge.

[Goal]
There are two user camps in the community: Those who want a lot more Gotchis, and those who are worried that more Gotchis would lead to Gotchi inflation and devalue their Gotchi assets.
Both camps have valid arguments. Yet, more Gotchis will be inevitable for two reasons.
Firstly, Haunts are a great source of income, both for Pixelcraft and Rarity Farming. Keeping Pixelcraft well fed, ensures that they can expand, which, in turn, means that we get more features, faster.
Secondly, many more Gotchis are needed to make Aavegotchis mainstream, which is one of the goals of the roadmap.
By offering the proposed game mechanic, people will sacrifice more and more Gotchis, thereby decreasing the Gotchi population. This will counteract the inflationary component of new Haunts.

[Why]
There are several reasons why people would use this mechanic, and each time it is used, the amount of Gotchis in the GrAAVEyard increases:
1. Anyone can resurrect ANY dead Gotchi. So there are already multiple incentives here: One might want the ID of a dead Gotchi, because that ID might be special to that user. Or a new users who bought several Haunt 2 Gotchis might want a Gotchi with a Haunt 1 ID but is not willing to pay 500+ GHST on the Bazaar for it.
2. Badge hunters will want that elusive tier 3 resurrection badge.
3. Gotchis with common traits can be sacrificed for a chance at a Gotchi with better stats. Since multiple Gotchis need to be sacrificed, the sampling bias introduced by this mechanic shouldn't be too bad.
4. Once new collaterals are added, people can use this mechanic to get a Haunt 1 ID Gotchi with a collateral that didn't exist during Haunt 1. This would be a super rare Gotchi!

[Potential risks or unintended consequences]
1. Bots. Depending on how many Gotchis the next few Haunts will have and how much they will cost, bot users might constantly query for Haunt 1 Ids in the GrAAVEyard and immediately revive them with cheap Gotchis of later Haunts. So if there ever is an ""unlimited edition"" Gotchi that is very cheap, those should either not be eligible to revive older Haunt IDs, or it should require a lot more ""unlimited edition"" Gotchis to be sacrificed in order to revive a Gotchi ID from a limited edition Haunt.
2. People might go really crazy over the resurrection badge and we might see a Gotchi massacre that will forever be remembered as ""the culling"". However, this wouldn't really be an issue, since it would only increase Gotchi value of older Haunts. And new Haunts could be spawned to make sure there is always a point of entry for newcomers.

Proposal Synopsis: change petting mechanism to « pet whenever you like within the 12 hours period ».

Proposal Details

Current system: You pet your Gotchi. You will be able to pet your Gotchi again after exactly 12 hours.

Problem: In theory, you should be able to pet twice a day everyday. In reality, it is not possible, since you won’t be able to pet exactly 12 hours later. Even with the best effort, you will lose few seconds, or minutes. If you try to pet everyday at 8:00 and 20:00, it will still slowly slide to 8:01 and 20:02, then 8:03 and 20:04… until a point where you will have to skip to pet again at 8:00. In the meantime, people using bots or script continue to pet twice a day, exactly with 12 hours interval. Because kinship is part of season reward and competition, this is not equitable.

Solution: set two 12 hours period, in which you can pet at any moment and be eligible for kinship. For example, we set 2 periods: period 1 from 00:00 to 11:59 and period 2 from 12:00 to 23:59. (timezone can be anything). For the period 1, if we pet anytime during 00:00 to 11:59, then we receive 1 kinship. For period 2, if we pet anytime between 12:00 and 23:59, then we receive 1 kinship.
This method will:
* provide more relaxed schedule for players, hence better quality of life.
* allow human players to compete with petting bots or scripts
* keep the current mechanism to pet twice in 24 hours.

A similar topic exists: “Petting Gotchis: 1-hour grace period” and a snapshot proposal was made, without success. I believe this is because of a lack of communication. I truly believe this mechanism IS needed for a better Aavegotchi as a project.","['Yes, pet anytime within 12 hours', 'No, keep as it is']","[2032133.8117384175, 99292.05033931763]",1

**Required Quorum**: 3.2M GHST (20% of current usable supply on Polygon)
**Vote Duration**: 7 days

## Proposal Details

We currently have a lot of Signal / Community Proposals on Snapshot and new posts on our forum everyday. So far none of those proposals were able to even get close to the quorum of 20%. The most popular one by @JG about adding additional fees for rarity farming only got around 2 million GHST in votes (~11%) - even though the team decided to take it as a Core Proposal. After being upgraded to Core we smashed right through the quorum in less than 24h.

I think there are two pretty obvious reasons for this. On the one hand, our Snapshot is a bit chaotic right now, with some Signal Proposals not following the template at all. On the other hand - and I think this is the more important one - voting on Core Proposal gets you 20 Experience (XP) for your Gotchi.

**I propose adding a small Experience drop (10 XP) for people who voted on successful Signal Proposals, meaning ones that reach quorum and get upgraded to Core Proposals. Simply dropping XP for all Community Proposals could result in more low quality suggestions, which shouldn't be the goal of this proposal.**

Even if 10 XP might not be much, it gives people incentives to actually look through the Signal Proposals and vote on quality proposals with a higher chance of reaching quorum. As a DAO, community involvement is extremely important and I believe this is a small, but decent, step in the right direction.

Summary of Proposal: This proposal suggests that future distributions (XP distributions, wearable sales/raffles, and season-end GHST distribution) set aside a small amount of the distribution and randomly airdrop the item to a small number of aavegotchi-holding wallets (i.e., a wallet that is holding an aavegotchi).

Problem : Going into Season 1, we’re losing interest from what I’ll call “low commitment” players who are unable to commit a sufficient amount of capital input to acquire expensive wearables or buy tons of raffle tickets at a chance of getting a wearable. These players were further dispirited by the recent Maal sale. Simply put, with no minigames out yet, folks who bought lower BRS gotchis are feeling like there’s not a place for them in the current meta, and this is being reflected in the decreasing gotchi prices. To many, the game is increasingly overwhelmingly “pay to play.”

Proposed Solution: For future distributions, a small amount of each distribution will be set aside and airdropped to a random gotchi-holding wallet that otherwise would not have received the distribution:

*For every XP drop, whatever the amount of XP that’s being distributed will also be distributed to three unique Aavegotchi-holding wallets that otherwise would not have received the XP. This is obviously free to the DAO
*For every wearable-distribution, the following number of items are set aside and randomly airdropped: 2 mythics, 5 legendaries, 10 rare, 10 uncommon, 10 common. This is also free to the DAO
*For the season-end GHST distribution, roughly 0.5% of the total GHST is set aside and airdropped to three Aavegotchi-holding wallets who finished outside the top 100 for that season. For this season, that would be a little less than 5,000 GHST being distributed, resulting in <2 GHST being taken away from each Aavegotchi who would be otherwise receiving GHST.

This means that an Aavegotchi essentially becomes a re-usable raffle ticket. Just by holding an Aavegotchi, users get a chance at receiving airdrops. Wallets will be weighted based on the number of Aavegotchis someone holds.
***
This should be very easy to implement with a simple contract that notes the owner wallets of all gotchis, and using Chainlink VRF randomly distributes the airdrop.

Overall, I think this is a very easy to implement solution that would dramatically increase user participation and retention, and increase the inherent value of all Aavegotchis.","['Yes, more community airdrops!', ""No, I don't like this""]","[928398.5593999864, 21343.604862259]",1

Discourse Discussion Thread (much more detail and analysis on here!): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/arp-part-ii-three-part-wearable-distribution-plan/1555

The Aavegotchi Revitalization Plan (ARP) is a series of proposals designed to increase user engagement and retention, and to increase the inherent value of Aavegotchis by rewarding users who own gotchis.

Summary of Proposal: Future wearable drops will be distributed in three waves.  One-third will be distributed through a traditional raffle (tickets purchased with FRENS).  The remaining two-thirds will be distributed through a ""riskless raffle"" where users stake GHST to claim an item, but don't lose their GHST if they don't win an item.  Users who own gotchis will be prioritized for half of these items.

Problem : Going into Season 1, we’re losing interest from what I’ll call “low buy-in” or more casual players who are unable to commit a sufficient amount of capital input to acquire expensive wearables or buy tons of raffle tickets for a chance of getting a wearable. These players were further dispirited by the recent Maal sale. Simply put, with no minigames out yet, folks who bought lower BRS gotchis are feeling like there’s not a place for them in the current meta, and this is being reflected in the decreasing gotchi prices. To many, the game is increasingly overwhelmingly “pay to play.” So far, the DAO has tried a few different wearable release methods, each with pros and cons.

Proposed Solution: This proposal suggests that future wearable drops are distributed in three waves (which could all take place at once). I propose the following three-wave system:

Raffles : One third of all new wearables are raffled off through the normal existing method. People continue staking GHST for FRENS, and buying/selling raffle tickets. This gives anyone a shot at getting a Godlike if they want, without spending 10k GHST, and isn’t susceptible to bots. Of course, we still have the issue of people losing money if they don’t get selected and feeling rekt, which leads us to the second and third waves…

“Riskless” Raffle (aka GHST staking) (two waves) : The remaining two thirds of new wearables are distributed through a “riskless raffle”.  Users stake GHST directly towards the item they want to acquire.  If they are selected, they get the item; if not, the contract returns their GHST and no one gets rekt. 

The riskless raffle proceeds in two waves: First , half of the wearables that are allocated for the riskless raffle (or one third of the total wearables) are randomly distributed to wallets that own gotchis. Wallets are weighted based on the number of aavegotchis they own, as determined by a snapshot shortly in advance of the raffle.  In this wave, wallets are limited to being awarded one item per gotchi they own.  This gives every Aavegotchi-holding wallet a decent chance of getting an item, since there are a finite amount of Aavegotchis.

Second , the remaining one-third of wearables will be randomly distributed among all users who have staked GHST towards the item contracts. Again, the contract will use VRF to randomly select a wallet that staked GHST towards that item. Obviously, those who stake more GHST will have a better chance of being awarded items here. Users will be charged a 1% fee on all GHST they stake. This will be negligible for people trying to get a rare or legendary item (just a few GHST), but will disincentivize people from staking vast amounts of GHST.
***
Overall, this proposal should be easy to implement using pre-existing contracts from the Maal and raffle.  This proposal will ensure that wearables are distributed equitably, and that owners of Aavegotchis are rewarded for holding a Gotchi","[""Yes, let's adopt this approach!"", ""No, I don't like this""]","[608487.6748558172, 24281.454941566095]",1

Gotchi: 3541 (Moon)
Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/xp-for-voting-on-signal-proposals/1528

TLDR: Add a 10 XP airdrop for people who voted on Community Proposals that get upgraded to Core.

We currently have a lot of Signal / Community Proposals on Snapshot and new posts on our forum everyday. So far none of those proposals were able to even get close to the quorum of 20%. The most popular one by @JG about adding additional fees for rarity farming only got around 2 million GHST in votes (~11%) - even though the team decided to take it as a Core Proposal. After being upgraded to Core we smashed right through the quorum in less than 24h.

I think there are two pretty obvious reasons for this. On the one hand, our Snapshot is a bit chaotic right now, with some Signal Proposals not following the template at all. On the other hand - and I think this is the more important one - voting on Core Proposal gets you 20 Experience (XP) for your Gotchi.

I propose adding a small Experience drop (10 XP) for people who voted on successful Signal Proposals, meaning ones that reach quorum and get upgraded to Core Proposals. Simply dropping XP for all Community Proposals could result in more low quality suggestions, which shouldn’t be the goal of this proposal. 

Even if 10 XP might not be much, it gives people incentives to actually look through the Signal Proposals and vote on quality proposals with a higher chance of reaching quorum. As a DAO, community involvement is extremely important and I believe this is a small, but decent, step in the right direction.","['Yes', 'No']","[2052229.75396394, 231911.81409475397]",1

All information below is taken from the original Signal Proposal, with slight modifications for clarity.

## Proposal Information ##

### Background:
With the announcement of SZN1 Rewards now official, we explore how to align the community's interests and rewards structures, as it pertains to Baazaar fees.

Currently, 2% is allocated to Pixelcraft and 1% to DAO treasury. While not exclusive of providing for RF rewards, the treasury funds are currently in no obligation to be allocated in any form of ratio towards the RF pool each season.

### Proposal:
Increase the Baazaar fees from 3% to 3.5%, with the additional 0.5% going directly to the Rarity Farming rewards pool.

### Arguments
Although nobody likes an increase in fees, the resulting increase from 3 to 3.5% would not be too disruptive on a per transaction basis, while for reference it would have increased SZN 1 rewards by a very healthy 55,000 GHST approx. (As per figures shared by Coderdan). Competitors already charge higher fees as in 5% at NBA Top-Shot and 4.25% at Axie marketplace.

### Benefits:
A major benefit is expanding the value proposition of Gotchies and Wearables, as proxies of participation into the efficient trading mechanism that is the Aavegotchi Bazaar on Polygon network.
A virtuous cycle of economic growth and value is fostered in the ecosystem, where trading brings a larger pool of rewards, which increases the velocity of trading within the Baazaar.

### Options:
* Yes, increase the fees from 3% to 3.5% to support Rarity Farming Player Rewards
* No, leave the fees as they are.

**Required Quorum**: 3.4M GHST (20% of all eligible GHST on Polygon)
**Required Vote Differential**: 10% (only two options)
**Vote duration**: 7 days

If this vote is passed with sufficient quorum, a contract upgrade will be deployed to increase the fee and begin directing said fee to the Rarity Farming Rewards Pool address, located at xxx.

*Note: Only fees accrued AFTER the enacting of this vote will be redirected to Rarity Farming rewards. SZN1 of Rarity Farming rewards are already capped at 1.4M GHST. All future rewards will be earmarked for future Seasons!*

This month, Season 1 of Rarity Farming will commence. Undoubtable, there will be a lot of ties in all three categories. The aim of this proposal is to change the tie breaker sorting criterion for the Kinship category to ""time until next interaction"" (with lower times ranking higher, of course).

**[Why]**
The Kinship ranking has a lot of ties, because people have been petting their Gotchis diligently. However, everyone's 12h petting cycle is a little different. The exact time of the reward snapshots could easily lower your rank 10 to 50 places, if it ends up being a few minutes before your next interaction would raise your Kinship score. This would lead to drama and upset frens, similar to what we've seen after Haunt 1.

**[Arguments PRO]**
Pro 1: The current tie breaker (Experience) has by far the most ties and is therefore not suited to be a tie breaker. There would still be a lot of ties left unbroken.

Pro 2: 'Time until next interaction' is (unlike any other criterion) directly tied to the Kinship score and therefore a much more fair tie breaker for the Kinship category.

Pro 3: Based on the time resolution (seconds or even milliseconds) 'time until next interaction' leaves virtually no ties left unbroken.

Pro 4: The current tie breaker (Experience) has its own reward category. ""Cross contamination"" between reward pools would make each pool less unique. Reward categories are there to reward *different* aspects.

**[Arguments CON]**
Con 1: It was already announced that Experience is going to be the tie breaker.

Con 2: Kinship is the tie breaker in the BRS category. Therefore it is only fair, if one of the other categories is the tie breaker in the Kinship category.

**[Counter arguments for CON]**
Counter for Con 1: Tie-breakers should have been determined by a core proposal all along. Hence, changing the tie-breaker, even after the announcement, would make for good press (e.g. Active DAO decides to make reward pool of ~ 300,000 USD more fair for active users).

Counter for Con 2: This proposal is ONLY for the Kinship category. Other categories are a different topic. But if we must discuss this here: Two wrongs don't make a right. BRS could easily tie-broken in more suitable ways. E.g. relative rarity - i.e. rank items uniquely by how many Gotchis are wearing them, and rank high/low traits by how many Gotchis have those traits high or low. Those are just two of many things that would be a better fit for the BRS category. 

**[Alternatives]**
1: Spread the snapshot timestamps for the 4 reward rounds 3h apart. E.g. round 1 at 1pm, round 2 (two weeks later) at 4pm, round 3 (two weeks later) at 7pm, and round 4 (two weeks later) at 10pm. This would mitigate the 12h issue to a much less effective degree, but it would still be better than nothing.

2: In addition, 'Time until next interaction' could be used as a second tie-breaker, for all the ties that are still unbroken after the Experience tie-breaker has been applied.

Gotchi: 3541 (Moon)
Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/adding-new-collaterals-awbtc-axsushi-as-spirit-force/1191

This is a proposal to add two new aTokens, specifically aWBTC and axSUSHI, as Spirit Force to Aavegotchi. The advantages of adding new collaterals should be pretty clear:

- We get to include more communities, especially of DeFi projects that share the same values as us.
- Players can summon an Aavegotchi while still being exposed to the price of their favorite token.
- A higher diversity of Aavegotchis. This could also give haunts distinct value since the odds of getting a specific collateral change.

I chose aWBTC and axSUSHI for the following reasons:

- aWBTC: Bitcoin is the mother of all crypto assets. As the largest cryptocurrency and the 4th largest Aave pool by market size, this is a no brainer in my opinion. It's the most conservative crypto investment and the first choice for anyone dipping their toes into the space.
- axSUSHI: They are one of the most recent additions to the Aave liquidity pools and have already grown to be one of the largest. What started as a simple Uniswap fork has now become one of the leading innovators. Since axSUSHI is the aToken of staked SUSHI (xSUSHI), players will earn staking rewards (currently ~4.83% APY) on top of the Aave yield.

The largest downside is the low yield on both of these assets, which is a common trend for speculative tokens. aWBTC is at around 0.16% APY right now, with axSUSHI generating ~0.01% yield on Aave. axSUSHI makes up for this with the staking rewards (~4.83%), which puts it at rank 2 in terms of yields of non-stable assets (just after aSNX with ~5.51%).

Another drawback is that this proposal could take some time for the devs to implement (adding them to Gotchis and bridging the aTokens to Matic) - time that might be spent building minigames and the realm.

Since the implementation would depend on different factors (amount of dev work, launch of new haunts, etc.) I can't give an exact timeline for this proposal. Would be great to have it included in haunt 2, but this is ultimately up to the team.

If you're unhappy with my choice of aTokens, keep in mind that we can always create proposals for new collaterals in the future.

Gotchi ID: 7972 (Dark)

Link: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/peer-to-peer-trading-widget/1067

Proposal Description:

There are several possible ways to interact with other users within the Aavegotchi community, and one such way includes the purchasing or selling of Aavegotchis, portals, and other items on the Baazaar. In this transactional exchange, User A may list their asset in the Baazaar for a particular price in GHST that can then be purchased by User B. This transaction takes place without a formal discussion between Users A and B; one user posts, the other person purchases, and the transaction executes.

Throughout my time in the Discord, I have noticed numerous users attempting to try to negotiate “trades” with other users. The prime conundrum users attempting to trade are currently facing is that there is no safe and trustless way to transfer in-app assets. Other than manually transferring assets from user-to-user, the only available option for these users includes the transferring of in-app assets to a vetted third-party/intermediary within the community (such as a developer or community leader) who then collects the assets/funds from both parties and allocates them accordingly. However, this introduces both inconvenience (to all three parties) and the risk of human error (i.e., mistyping an address, or sending the incorrect asset).

My proposal is to create an in-app “Trade” widget, wherein users who have made an agreement off-app, for example on Discord or other discussion/social media platforms, can propose trades to other users. If accepted, the trade will process and the assets/funds will be transferred from each user to the other user in the agreement.

With this widget, there are innumerable possibilities. For instance, users can trade Aavegotchis, items, and even GHST, FRENS, or raffle tickets with one another. Gotchi for GHST, Gotchi for raffle tickets, portals for Aavegotchis, FRENS for items, etc.

Another possibility could be to “propose” trades, wherein users will have the option to open any individual’s Gotchi or Portal page and propose a trade. A great example of this is in Fantasy sports, where users are able to accept or reject trades made by other users.

Another possibility could be to have the “Trade” option listed for every asset listed on the Baazaar, so if a user does not want to spend the listed amount in GHST for a particular listed asset, they can propose a trade. For example, if an Aavegotchi is listed for 10,000 GHST, a user can propose a Trade countering the 10,000 GHST listed price and instead offering up a rare Haunt 1 portal.

Ultimately this will provide users with a standardized, trustless mechanism for trades that allows for more flexibility with what they can do with their in-app assets, while mitigating the risks associated with transferring assets to other random users.","['I want a trading widget', 'I do not want a trading widget']","[1814091.0929779585, 10055.710695009631]",1

This is considered a problem by those who voted NO, as this reduces the value/rarity of aavegotchis. Yes, we can add special backgrounds to Haunt 1 aavegotchi, but in a play-to-win environment, this is of little use.

This proposal is to entitle Haunt 1 Aaveogotchi owners a fixed share of seasonal winnings. For example, 10% of season prizes (in this case 10% of 1.4M GHST = 140k) will forever be allocated towards Aavegotchi Haunt 1 owners, this will be a nice extra touch to the rarity and use of the OG 10.000 Gotchis.

Aavegotchi is one of the most innovative NFT ecosystems in the space, but presents an unfriendly on-ramp for new users. Why don’t we create a companion to Aavegotchis for the kid who only knows how to play on his Switch or for the Generation X/Baby Boomers who may have more trouble than average trying to engage this ecosystem.

Lil Aavegotchis could be what brings Aavegotchis to the mainstream.

Create a mini/toy companion set of NFTs called Lil Aaveotchis that have already been summoned through a portal and come with a very small amount (chosen by the user) of maGHST or another maToken that they can stake and hold as long as they want.

Maybe the treasury can contribute 0.1 GHST for hundreds of thousands of Lil Gotchis to be handed out on social media? Lil Gotchis could provide liquidity to GHST or any compatible token and even to the Aavegotchi ecosystem. Lil Gotchis can be very trendy and if airdropped to wallets who have held GHST or MATIC or engaged the MATIC ecosystem in some way they can explode in popularity and bring more people to Aavegotchi.

Think of the memes.

There can be a separate marketplace and item set for the Lil Gotchis. Holding them can contribute to the rarity and experience of your Aavegotchi. The possibilities are endless.","['I want a Lil Aavegotchi', 'I do not want a Lil Aavegotchi']","[1396628.0114371015, 234892.53209890053]",1

145,QmfSQR6HqfSmRUMJ7avGQ1TKUGm1XiPE8cXEanXemnNarg,Making the distribution of rarity farming more equal.,"
The way the distribution is designed is absolute concentration.  It's  almost impossible to a newbie player reach the top positions of the leaderboard. The first place winner is receiving the vast majority of the prizes and he will stay there practically for ever cause he can reinvest the prizes for getting the best wearables and buying more portals.  How a new player will rise in the ranking to the point of overcoming first place? Impossible! The first place will remain there forever, simply. The difference of prizes between the ranking should be minimal. With minimal prize difference between the leaderboard all NFT gotchi will have a nicer market value, and players could play with more than one gotchis if they want bigger prizes. Right now if you have a low grade aavegotchi you will never sell it, nobody will buy it , and you will never get good prize by rarity.

How is rarity farming currently being distributed:
Rank 1 - 135828,31 GHST (that`s 15% of all GHST distributed in the pool!! This player will stay here in top 1 for ever !!!)
Rank 2 - 67914.15
Rank 3 - 43942,77
Rank 4 - 31957.08
Rank 5 - 24965.66
Rank 6 - 20071,38
Rank 7 - 17218.33
Rank 8 - 15078.54
Rank 9 - 13414.26
Rank 10 - 12082.83
...
Rank 500 - 119,83 (almost nothing)

Suggestion of a better way to distribute the prizes, avoiding the absolute power of the first places and allowing new players to rise in the ranking. We  also create better market value for all gotchis NFT's:

Example: 1 millon GHST pool for 500 players.
Suggestion: Sum of weights method: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + 500 = 125250 shares
This way the prize decreases by 8 GHST each position lower
Rank 1 : 3992 GHST (500 shares)
Rank 2 : 3984 GHST (499 shares)
Rank 3 : 3976 GHST (498 shares)
...
Rank 100 : 3129 GHST (400 shares)
...
Rank 200 : 2320  GHST (300 shares)
...
Rank 300: 1520 GHST (200 shares)
...
Rank 400: 800 GHST (100 shares)
Rank 500: 1  GHST ( 1 share)
...

This way ALL NFT aavegotchi will have nice market value!! If you are a whale you can play with two or more gotchis for double gains! The way is designed right now most of the gotchis has no value in the market and will never reach the top spots.

One would be based strictly on GHST holdings while the other would be based on a one Gotchi-one vote principle.

Because of the tokenomics of Aavegotchi and the need for risk investment and liquidity, those community members with a lot of skin in the game should have a weighted influence on certain classes of decisions, e.g., those with dilutive or inflationary impact on the Gotchi market.  But there are other classes of community decisions where voting based on Gotchis holdings rather than GHST assets should prevail, for example, decisions involving gameplay rules, haunt procedures, rarity mechanics, etc.

Having two such voting mechanisms for DAO governance would balance the influence of investors with those of crypto-neophytes, DeFi advocates and gamers. This should help avoid Aavegotchi becoming a niche game solely for high-asset collectibles speculators while promoting an ecosystem that incentivizes game play and community engagement.

Of course, the devil is in the details.  But this DAO Cocoon phase is the perfect time to start evolving such a voting model and identifying which aspects of DAO governance voting should be GHST weighted and which should be Gotchi weighted.","['Good Idea', 'Bad Idea']","[383367.3458982453, 1341.1342285875276]",1

152,QmT8PNdr27GVGKTrRAgNz8DD965oBwwatQkQBXGoh3kYij,Proposal: Gotchi breeding,"**Introduction**

After the opening of the *portals*, there are a lot of lonely and abandoned Ghotchi with a *rarity score* below 500. They are sold on the market for a penny and no one wants to be frens with them. To give them utilitarian properties, I propose to introduce a new *mechanic* **""Breeding ghosts""**.

**Breeding mechanics description**

You can take two gotchi, combine them and get a new one with random traits in return (the old two gotchi will be sacrificed).
Also, traits may not be completely random, but generated based on the traits of the parents. In this way, it will be possible to even create ghosts with the desired traits (but always with random eyes).
At the same time, it turns out that not all ghosts are good for each other, for example, a ghost with a **high** energy trait does not fit well with a ghost with a **low** energy trait, since as a result this trait will be averaged.
We can also add new ""Generation"" property, which means how many generations of ancestors this ghost had. For this procedure, you can take a commission in $GHST and send it to treasure. The commission can increase with each generation.

Thus, we will reduce the number of ordinary ghosts and give them more value, and also there will be another completely new profession for Aavegotchi ecosystem.

**Summary**
**- Make gotchi with common traits more valuable and add to them new utility function**
**- Replenishment of the treasury through commissions**
**- New profession for Aavegotchi masters**

*P.S. This is a general description of the new mechanics, and of course it can be simplified or made more complex.*","['Yes, I like the idea', ""No we don't need it""]","[790190.3896271926, 148748.295524821]",1

This can add or subtract to the specific trait of the Gotchi.

For example, in a USDC Gotchi, the following could be introduced:

1000 USDC        = -1 SPK
10000 USDC      = -2 SPK
100000 USDC   = -3 SPK
1000000 USDX = -4 SPK

Whilst in a DAI Gotchi

1000 USDC        = +1 NRG
10000 USDC      = +2 NRG
100000 USDC   = +3 NRG
1000000 USDX = +4 NRG

154,QmcSvCCyk8GdT58H6d9YgmmRr9SsGJHh4haxREnRoYLYT7,Everyone has the Chance to reserve 1 Portal in advance,"So the idea is, that there will be a normal haunt. Not an extra one, just the normal hunt incomming someday.

You can reserve only 1 Portal in advance and save it for the haunt day. On the hunt day itself, you have the chance to buy this one for sure, and haunt for the others just as we did this time.

You have 24 hours to claim and buy your reserved Portal. Otherwise there will be the afterhaunt. On the day After, all reserved Portals, who did not get bought, will be sold. It will be done just as a normal hunt. First come, first serve.
This way, everybody could get at least one Portal but the first come, first serve base and the excitement, if we got more than one Portal will stay. 

I think it's a great idea to allow everybody to buy at least one Portal at haunt day. If you wanna buy more than one, you can do that in the normal, first come, first serve, haunt.","['Yes', 'No']","[513032.71470308857, 29975.733160375836]",1
155,QmagQ1cuXen2dUNBMsao6QTy9GDV4jPRgYvdtxQhkfF16C,One portal for those who missed out.,"Vote for the honest proposal of deadend of Haunt 1.

This proposal kind of resembles the other proposal to approve all failed transactions, with one key difference.

The idea would be simple:

load up all failed transactions
check the corresponding wallets for a successful transaction
if the wallets did not manage to get a successful transaction at the time of the haunt, host a private haunt just for these wallets where they get the option to buy a single portal each.
this way everyone who participated at this haunt will be able to at least get a chance of getting their own gotchi without having to pay ten times the price on the bazaar.

we’ve all been looking forward to this moment a lot, some of us for a very long time. this drop was over in the blink of an eye, some people walked away with dozens of portals while others got nothing. this really stings. of course, congrats on selling out in a minute. but thats just fun for the devs and marketing. as a community we are just left out in the dust and thats not what frens are for.

So a private haunt for everyone who missed out but did participate would be aawesome.

There are many possible methods to do this, but I believe the fairest method is to create an annual event where only Haunt-1 Gotchis can participate in. 

Many ideas come to mind like:

1. Every anniversary of the launch, Aavegotchi's annual games are held where only Haunt-1 Gotchis can participate 

2. Other Haunt Gotchis can participate, but would need a Haunt-1 Fren to partner up with

3. Maybe a very low tax can be imposed to 'partner up' e.g. 0.1 GHST

4. Haunt-1 Gotchis who 'bring the most Frens' could win prizes as well

Anyway, these are just some ideas of what an exclusive Haunt-1 Gotchi event could look like. I am sure, further down the line, the idea could be refined but the gist is there.

I propose to make a filing system for portals and accessories : 
- Possibility to classify the gates and accessories by increasing and decreasing price.
- Possibility to classify accessories by level of rarity 

For open portals, to have the possibility to see directly the rarity score of the highest aavegotchi. This will allow us to avoid clicking on each open portal when searching for a purchase.

The first competition should be based on the wearables currently available in the gotchi metaverse.

- Keeping the existing wearables would allow the market to determine their value for the upcoming competition.

- Keeping the existing wearables as they are would allow for more aggressive strategies to be employed for the competition.

- Adding more wearables to the mall would saturate what is currently listed in the baazaar.","['Agree', 'Disagree']","[445192.9956028355, 64263.54488685048]",1

I prepared weeks in advance for the launch and was one of the many that watched the timer go from 10k to 0 with 3 failed matic transactions.

I have now settled on the thought I will not get a portal until the next haunt unless I pay the inflated prices in the bazaar which is disappointing.

However, I think it is worse that the people that didn’t get a portal will also not be able to get the XP drop from voting on the eth network.

So in addition to not getting a portal at launch, I would need to buy an inflated bazaar aavegotchi to gain the reward from the vote that to be fair, cost a bit on gas!

Surely we can introduce some sort of caveat to say that if you didn’t get a portal/aavegotchi but voted on eth and are expecting the XP drop, it can be dropped as a consumable versus not getting anything??","['Accept, consumables for XP drop', 'Reject ']","[447928.6059786686, 947888.6090696788]",0
