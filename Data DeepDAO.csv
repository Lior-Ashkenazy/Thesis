Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

(This proposal has been resubmitted using the new VP thresholds and voting period. Originally posted by Joe)

**WonderMine is a social play-to-earn game** where you mine meteors, collect resources and craft upgrades and rewards in the form of wearables and other NFTs. WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.

We want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.

## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

## Description

When creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.

We are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.


## Specification

Acquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:

**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.

**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.

**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!

**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!

15231,15231,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,For Decentraland Daily Active Users: MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP,"> by 0x091f3b14a3323819c36ad0ec1298f97f0c7e0caa

## Linked Draft Proposal
[For Decentraland Daily Active Users: MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8ce58760-dc80-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)

## Summary

Allocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap; wherein, MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.


## Abstract

Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth. ICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.


## Motivation

Decentral Games ICE Poker is the first free play-and earn poker game launched in Decentraland in October 2021 that accounts for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users. If you hop into Decentraland and view the top scenes, you will be directed to an ICE Poker venue where you can play and interact with thousands of other real people, a social experience that no other open metaverse platform has been able to deliver.

ICE Poker has onboarded and will continue to onboard users into Decentraland and the Decentraland wearables ecosystem by delivering direct utility through self-custody and delegation of Decentraland wearables. After creating a Decentraland avatar and purchasing a wearable to play ICE Poker, many players explore other scenes and invest in adjacent Decentraland projects, as well as create their own inspired by ICE Poker.

In addition to ICE Poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more.

The stats today:

*   12 live Decentraland venues
*   1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND
*   8,000+ daily active players
*   203,000+ monthly visitors across all venues (April 2022)


## Specification

Allocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.

### Details:

*   Within 10 days following the final binding proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the ICE-USDC LP.
*   MANA will be distributed by smart contract, available claim in proportion to the amount of LP staked and the amount of time that LP is staked.
*   0 MANA will be earned/retained by the DG DAO Treasury and DG Team. Specifically, the DG DAO will not stake the LP it provides to the pool, so all rewards will go to community members staking LP tokens.


## Impacts

Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space: The competition is spending on development and promises eventual users; DCL has users.

This proposal will support the ICE price and thereby maintain DCL DAU while SNGs ramp up, but this describes only half the equation and represents the small upside to DCL. In the true ""upside scenario,"" SNG closes the remaining gap toward making the ICE economics sustainable, and the ICE Poker ecosystem succeeds in onboarding millions of players into Decentraland. Half of the gap to sustainability has already been closed, and, in short, the proposal helps bridge the remainder across 3 months, reversing DCL's DAU decline in the short term and facilitates returning to growth sooner. The ""downside scenario"" is that SNG does not succeed in spite of substantial progress made to-date and this proposal only serves to sustain DCL DAU while rewards are deployed.

The mechanics of of LP rewards sustain the ICE price are straightforward: Rewarding the ICE-USDC LP pool (while excluding the DG DAO LP from being rewarded) will generate incremental demand for ICE. It's challenging to predict the exact amount of this demand in advance; this would cause a significant amount of ICE to be taken out of circulation and placed in the pool; as a result, the ICE price will be supported while SNG is releases and ramps up.


## Implementation Pathways

As outlined in the 'Specification' section, the only required step for implementation by the DCL DAO itself will be for the DCL DAO to transfer $1M MANA to dgtreasury.eth. The DG Team will deploy on Polygon their audited LP rewards smart contract that was previously used to reward the ETH-DG LP pool and apply this reward ICE-USDC LP on QuickSwap. MANA Rewards will be distributed to those who stake these LP tokens as outlined in the 'Specification' section and a UI will be provided on https://decentral.games/dg/liquidity.


## Conclusion

Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation.

**This proposed MANA allocation is not a grant for the Decentral Games team** – its entire purpose is to maintain daily active and concurrent users within the Decentraland and Decentral Games ecosystems as the Decentral Games team completes development and launches ICE Poker SNG. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth.

ICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.

Since the Stage 1 proposal was posted, it’s been inspiring to see all the stories of Decentraland creators’ events being well-attended by the ICE Poker community, the ICE Poker community investing in other wearable creators/games, and even cases where folks who found Decentraland via DG have since started their own venues, projects, and games in Decentraland. This initiative would welcome ICE Poker players (folks who use Decentraland every day), wearable owners, and the Decentraland community at large to provide this LP, earn MANA, and further participate in the Decentraland DAO.

**Why should the Decentraland DAO itself fund these rewards?**

The Decentraland DAO has assigned $200mm in MANA to their Ecosystem Fund to fund development of engaging content in Decentraland. ICE Poker has already proven its ability to deliver value to Decentraland by driving the majority of Decentraland’s daily active and concurrent user growth in 2022. The majority of the Decentral Games treasury is locked in illiquid Decentraland LAND, LP for DG and ICE, and a Polygon Validator node.

**Why $1mm and why 3 months?**

$1mm USD in MANA would provide sufficient rewards over a 3 month period to allow the Decentral Games team to deliver on building, launching, and growing ICE Poker SNG, which will enable the ecosystem to self-sustain following the ending of the rewards.

**From a proposal execution perspective, why should DG distribute the MANA rewards?**

The DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP on decentral.games, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution. To reiterate, the DG Treasury and Decentral Games will earn 0 MANA. The rewards will go entirely to the community.

**A note from the DG Project Lead and Founder, Miles Anthony:**

""We’ve had conviction around Decentraland and its role in delivering an interactive 3D frontend for the open metaverse from its inception in 2017. Since then, we’ve purchased 1000+ parcels of LAND and invested millions of dollars to build engaging content to attract and retain over 60% of the platform’s users. This MANA allocation is a stepping stone to assist in stabilizing our in-game economy as we prepare to launch ICE Poker Sit-n-Go tournaments, along with other key initiatives that drive organic demand and utility for ICE and solidify our ecosystem’s long term sustainability. With the support of the Decentraland team and community, we look forward to onboarding the next million users into Decentraland and the nascent metaverse.""

Are you in favor?","> by 0x43b2cc9004630b2912abbce0fdf09ff5a3cc144b (Aardvark)

These are several of the reasons for the need for this proposal:

1.  Over 30,000 names have been claimed for 100 MANA each. Each of these names currently has 100 voting power. If we reduce the cost of the names, does the voting power also drop? Does it drop just for those that claim a name for a lower price? If so, who will track which names were claimed at full price and which were claimed at reduced price to determine voting power? If the voting power is reduced for all names including those that were claimed for 100 MANA, then it will create an inequity in voting power distribution.

2.  Owning an NFT name is not a requirement for participating in any activities in Decentraland. It is purely optional. In fact, anyone can enter Decentraland and use any name of their choice at any time for free. It will just have several additional characters added at the end as an extension. Therefore, I question the need to reduce the price of names at all.

3.  It seems that virtually every day there are several names claimed for 100 MANA each. If people are willing to continue to pay 100 MANA to claim a name then there should be no reason to reduce the price.

4.  Many of those that claimed one or more of the 30,000 existing names for 100 MANA did so as an investment. These are NFT’s that have value. If the cost of claiming a named is dropped, it will completely change the value structure of these NFT’s. All those that were claimed for 100 MANA will drop in value.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

With the recent desire for vehicles in DCL, we see the need for a new type of game experience. We want to create a vehicle safe haven called Vroomway. Players will play racing-style game experiences to gather resources, craft parts, and redeem wearables with those parts. Each wearable will be a Skin and when equipped on Vroomway land will transform their avatar into the corresponding vehicle model. Players will have both PVE and PVP-style experiences.


## Grant size

60,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x4317036d2Cb249e3e4B847164674B7d27C33442b

## Description

Like we mentioned above, there is a strong desire for vehicles in DCL. Not only a desire for them, but a use case for them as well. Vroomway will provide not only a place for vehicles to live, but also a place for vehicle lovers to commune. We believe our social corner will be a safe place for people to hang out, party, and learn. Players can receive EXP points purely by dancing on the dance floor while their vehicle re-charges. Creating a theoretically endless experience.

Players will have the opportunity to not only redeem the skins/vehicles, but they will also be able to [upgrade their vehicles](https://www.notion.so/Vehicles-abd6af1408cb4217a8e2f5d50813f44c) from level 1 to level 3. Each higher-level yields higher attributes. Mythic and Unique vehicles will be automatically set to level 3 for their rarity.

The first release in the game will be the Parking Garage. Players must spend FUEL to race. Players get an x amount of fuel every 24 hours and also can receive it as a reward/drop. Players can also get fuel cost reduction from temporary perks purchased in the shop or from crafting certain vehicles! The parking garage will be pretty straightforward, to begin with. Phase 1 will have several floors with various types of obstacles. Every lap there will be 3 randomly spawned cargo crates that if they run over they can collect. These cargo crates contain a randomized assortment of resources/materials. These cargo containers can only be opened in the Junkyard. While also in the Junkyard, players can rummage through the scrap piles to gather additional resources/materials. Players will take these materials and resources to the crafting station where they can craft vehicle tokens to redeem at the shop. In addition to redeeming the skins/vehicles with the vehicle tokens, players can also buy more cargo crates as well as temporary game perks. You can read more about each section and the concept visuals [HERE](https://www.notion.so/Scene-Details-8c1ec1ccead7493e8355e440efbc860d)

The second release will be our Demo Derby. This will bring derby car-style gaming to the mix. Players will face off in a PVP instance consisting of 5-10 players all with derby cars. This will also introduce a line of Derby Car vehicles with perks pertaining to the Demo Derby experience. We plan to provide a range of different perks to suit different play styles.

The last addition will be the Fuego Speedway. The Speedway will consist of a PVP battle royal type of experience. Players will race around a giant 2x8 track with various obstacles. Players will have power-ups and power-downs that they can use on themselves or other players.

Nikki envisions Vroomway hosting never before seen tournaments with never before seen prizes. With the full deployment of the game, Vroomway will host competitive seasons every 2 months and the winner of each season will be rewarded with a 1:1 skin/vehicle. Nikki also sees a major opportunity for cross-promotion/collaboration with other play 2 earn games currently in DCL. With the introduction of seasons, we can also change the Parking Garage configuration each time to give players a new feel to the

Nikki Fuego has assembled a team that is both passionate about the project and passionate about the community it is being made for. Nikki alone has 12 years of experience in the digital business industry. Nikki herself is an avid gamer and heavily involved with the DCL community as both a player and a creator.

We have a pretty robust redeemable and upgrading system planned for the vehicles. We plan to launch with 4 Mythic and 3 unique vehicles to exclusive holders. you can read more about [HERE](https://www.notion.so/Vehicles-abd6af1408cb4217a8e2f5d50813f44c)

There are also attributes attached to the vehicles that players can craft. The game will launch with 3 initial rarity types to claim - Rare, Epic, and Legendary - with plans in the future to release redeemable Mythic and Unique vehicles. Anyone who owns an original VroomVroom or VroomVroom Model O will be amongst the first to receive a bonus in-game. Players that currently possess any Mythic/Unique wearable published by Nikki Fuego, will receive a vehicle to match those wearables and their rarities. You can see the full list [HERE](https://www.notion.so/VroomVroom-Mythic-Unique-Holders-3719b399d0c345f7b1a568f31a930c2e)

As the community grows we plan to expand and introduce even more experiences. We have a flying vehicle experience planned but will take a lot of development/support to achieve seamlessly.

We will have a fully public discord server where we will continuously update the community on the game progression. We will post weekly announcements providing important information to the public and the Vroomway community.

## Abstract

**WonderMine is a social play-to-earn game** where you mine meteors, collect resources and craft upgrades and rewards in the form of wearables and other NFTs. WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.

We want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.

## Beneficiary address

## Description

When creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.

We are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.


## Specification

Acquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:

**Server improvements**
To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.

**WonderZone NFTs**
Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.

**Shared meteors and meteor tiers**
Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining.  Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game**. The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!

**Kingfisher social fishing game**
Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!

15236,15236,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP on QuickSwap,"> by 0x521b0fef9cdcf250abaf8e7bc798cbe13fa98692 (Kyllian)

Decentral Games ICE Poker is the first metaverse-native poker game. ICE Poker is a free play-and-earn poker game that gives players economic freedom through self-custody and delegation of wearables.

In addition to poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more. DG has experienced significant growth since launching ICE Poker in fall 2021 and have onboard thousands of people into Decentraland.

Decentral Games is continuing to grow the ecosystem by launching competitive tournaments and metaverse advertising in our venues. We’re targeting July to launch sit-and-go tournaments which will increase product stickiness and improve our scaling to onboard the next larger wave of users into Decentraland. The stats today:

*   12 live Decentraland venues
*   1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND
*   8,000+ daily active players
*   40,000+ weekly visitors across all venues

All told, Decentral Games Venue visitors and ICE Poker players account for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users!

### PROPOSAL

Assign $1M USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP bootstrap the pool. This is temporary (3-month) support while sit-and-go tournaments are developed, launch (July), and ramp up.

Note 1: If the final proposal passes, within 10 days following the proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the LP, but no MANA would be retained/kept by the DG DAO. Specifically, 0 MANA will be assigned to the LP that the DG DAO itself provides to the pool (DG DAO won't stake LP), so all rewards will go to these Decentraland community members staking LP.

Note 2: While this request would exceed the grant threshold, these are liquidity incentives for an LP pool on QuickSwap rather than a grant to the DG DAO (which would earn 0 MANA).

### RATIONALE

The DCL DAO assigning  MANA to bolster ICE-USDC liquidity (& $ICE price) would contribute to maintaining Decentraland's DAU. As mentioned in the proposal section, this would be temporary support for the pool (3 months).

Moreover, most ICE holders are not MANA holders and this would help correct for the imbalance that most users of Decentraland today are Decentral Games event participants and ICE Poker players that do not hold MANA; namely, this would be an avenue to welcome them into the DCL DAO as well.

The DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution rather than Decentraland.

## Abstract

In the process of building a consistent reporting station for Decentraland, we have been able to produce consistent content, but we are only getting started!

Recently we have brought on a new team of Reporters to join us, which will allow us to stream and produce content 7 days a week!

After completing 26 Weeks of streaming back-to-back, they will be rewarded their own 1-of-1 Decentraland Reporter Jacket like this one: https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x5d26b194ffed9f4d33ee6000bcba55a68fe7af21/tokens/1

Working with the Metazoo Team, we will be able to produce Unique jackets for our devoted reporters, who will earn their right to call themselves official Decentraland Reporters!

It's important we secure this grant now as the price of mana will go up making it harder for us to afford the publishing cost (500 Mana) and the designer fee.


## Specification

Starting 9/26, we will be seeing our reporters every week and those that complete their 26th episode will be rewarded a jacket designating them as an official decentraland reporter.

We will work with Metazoo to create and publish quality and historically significant wearables which will serve as a collectible piece for our community in the future!

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

Ethermon is a play-to-earn game ecosystem, revolving around dynamic Mon NFTs and spanning a growing number of platforms and blockchains. It launched as the **first NFT battle game on Ethereum in 2017**.

When the original team decided to end development, the most passionate players stepped up and took over the project in 2019. This has been a community-driven project ever since.

Our browser-based PVP battle game has steadily grown to over 280K registered accounts on ethermon.io. However, our most exciting and intensive development is our Ethermon District in Decentraland.

Our mission is to turn the largest game-focused district (668 LAND) into the most active and immersive full-scale MMO-inspired experience in Decentraland.

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xEe9A8b81B85e23c101776a8580D73002Dc4d8915

## Description

Our team has dedicated 11 months now to building the Ethermon District into the best MMO game possible — focusing on the gameplay experience before monetization. All of us in the DCL community are blazing trails through the challenges inevitable in this new frontier of metaverse gaming.

This project has come an incredibly long way since it began in 2017. For Ethermon to reach the full potential we saw when we decided to take over the project as players and community members, we are inviting all of you across DCL to join our community.

The funding requested would allow us to make key hires and server upgrades necessary to achieve the ambitious goals detailed in Alpha 2.0 and Alpha 3.0 of the roadmap below. We want to deliver these exciting updates on an expedited timeline for our community who has been with us since the beginning.

Let’s make this a truly community-driven success and take Ethermon to the next level.


## Specification

We launched the pre-alpha version of the Ethermon District in April 2021. Post-release, we have been improving it around the clock for nearly a year with a dedicated global team. You can now explore our extensive town center with your 3D-rendered Mons, enjoy regular community events, and battle PVE enemies in the first of 6 battle biomes.

### Alpha 1.0

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

VoxBoards is a project born in Decentraland (late December 2021), created for/with its community. We have been collaborating with many members of the space with the goal of mutual growth and union between users, projects, brands and Decentraland.
We created many skateboard related NFTs including 3D models, wearables and assets. We have been organizing and sponsoring several events and contests. During april we tested a small alpha version of the skatepark with a p2e game, running with daily users:

## Grant size

39,800 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x8FE076264169d72de40e8c60bA8C5D273fC405e1

## Description

What will we develop?

VoxBoards HQ at the Meta GamiMall(147,60):

*   Skateshop: HQ's Lobby and shop

*   Skatepark: P2E Game

*   Stage/Gallery: Events and promotion

Skate Shop:

The HQ lobby, where users will find an assistant, Decentraland wearables and other NFTs to purchase. The wearables on the shop will benefit the players during the P2E. Perks will include power-ups and game avatars(Avatar Swap). This will raise the value of those NFTs, their ownership, the project and Decentraland.

Skatepark P2E:

Players will have tokens to collect, obstacules and enemies to avoid, compete for top scores, win prizes, use NFTs and enjoy a skateboarding game in Decentraland.
Skatepark, characters, avatars and assets can be changed according to events, seasons and tournaments. This will allow other projects to join and give the opportunity for their communtities to experience NFT ownership utility, which will bring more traffic and value to Decentraland simultanously.
The player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby. Inside the skatepark,the user can log in and play. There will be rounds of 3 minutes to catch a limited amount of tokens, enemies to avoid and diferent levels to unlock.

Club:

A place for events and promotional content, where users can join, hang out and celebrate. NFTs can be displayed and purchased, users can learn more about Decentraland, NFT utility, web3, watch in-game and IRL competitions, interviews, streamings, videos and interact with assets.
We will utilize this feature to bring more projects to decentraland and experience the metaverse, by offering a space where they can find their target costumers and give more utility possibilities to their community members and customers.
The skatepark and stage assets, characters and gallery can be customized. We are ready to host events, create avatars, wearables, assets and promotional content.
The player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby or skatepark.

How will it be sustainable?

Our plan is to have a space where other projects and brands can relate and join, which will bring more users. Creating more wearables for decentraland with game features will bring more value to the NFTs and Decentraland.
There are many people interested in skateboarding and we believe this project can expand quickly and bring gamers, IRL skaters, brands, NFT projects and their communuties if done on a bigger scale.

Once we have the HQ running we can generate income by:

*   Renting space for exposing NFTs and other merch, making them available for purchase
*   Custom events for clients
*   Creating/Selling NFTs with game utility
*   Selling merch(IRL or NFT)

The funds from DAO would allow us to create improved and sustainble experiences that we can later present to users, clients and collaborators. We plan to work with iconic creators, invest on promoting and bringing more people in, by building a platform with a fun game-play and dynamic supportive enviroment.


## Specification

In order to complete the project we need to build the HQ, design characters and other assets, develop the game structure/mechanics and code using SDK.

Skate shop:

*   SkateShop Model: base model and interior decorations.

*   Assistant Model: character at the store that users can interact for guidance about the HQ .

*   Forge Machine: to forge items and NFTs

Skatepark P2E game:

*   Skatepark model: The base.

*   Skatepark assets: diferent models that we can upload for different levels and challenges in the game.

*   Animated platforms and obstacules: assets to make the gameplay more challenging and appealing.

*   Tokens:  to collect all around the skatepark. They can be used to craft items and NFTs.

*   Game Avatars: We will start with 10 avatars!  10 that can be earned or bought and are associated with wearables (limited stock on both options). The game avatars are NFTs, using the same technology as in the MetaDoge NFT CoinRace (Avatar Swap). The will be specially designed and animated for the game.

*   Assistant: To guide the user..

*   Friends: Skater characters cheering for you and giving you tips when you approach and interact with them

*   Enemies: Security characters who will collide with the players if unavoided and teleport them out of the building. Enemies skating around the park who will collide if unavoided and make player loose tokens.

*   Wearables: The “voxboard bundle 1”(lower body) will provide the utility to enter and play the game. “VoxBoarder”(skin) has 2 representations which will be associated with 2 avatars.  Other existing wearables are going to grant bonus scores in game. We will also create and publish 5 more skater clothing items and 4 more skins to be associated with 8 avatars.
    Creating total of 9 more wearables instead of other NFTs for the Avatar Swap it's a way to bring back funds to the DAO while giving more value to Decentraland, MANA, and trading.

Club:

*   Stage Model: The base model and interior decorations.

*   Assets: Screen, poap machine, ramps and other skateboarding related assets, for the space to be more fun and interactive.

*   Gallery: Displaying NFTs and other content linked to markets.

*   Assistant: To guide the user and teleport to other area.

Budget:

*   Building HQ base model (design) - $2,100
*   P2E development  (game mechanics, design and assets) - $3,000
*   4 skins/8 designs  (design + publishing fees) - $4,400
*   10 game avatars associated with wearables\* (design for game +  animations) - $6,600
*   1 assistant (design +  animations) - $400
*   2 friendly characters (design + animations) - $400
*   2 enemy characters (design + animations) - $1000
*   5 wearables (design + publishing fees) - $5,500
*   SDK development (setup Grab Coin+Avatar Swap+interactive characters and assets+maintnance and updates) - $10,000
*   Launch event ( promotion, advertising, hosts and djs) - $4,000
*   Community management - $2,400

\*1 of the 10 avatars will be associated with decentraland wearables: ""VoxBoarder"". It will redesigned to be on a skateboarding pose and have game animations (stopped, pushing, riding and jump+trick).

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

Wilderness Play 2 Earn is a Free-to-Play MMO-RPG set in Decentraland. It is currently one of the most visited scenes in Decentraland at all times of the day, ranking in top 10 scenes more often than not.

It started as a 1 man project with the help of Decentraland DAO approving a grant of 3000$ to fund the initial idea, and has grown into one of the most ambitious projects in Decentraland with a strong community and fast pace of development.

We are now starting to expand our team and hitting the accelerator as we work towards achieving a Product Market Fit and  building the foundations for a decentralized organization that can survive for years to come.

**Current Ecosystem**:

Wilderness started as an MMORPG which provides a fun gaming experience while incentivizing players with earning opportunities. Wilderness creates a vibrant economy for its players with 0 Price for Participation \[Free to Play] by **earnestly distributing the value created in the game back to its players**.

Starting with an immersive Magic Combat experience, Wilderness players enter a fantasy world to explore mythical creatures in a fantasy world, discover new tactics everyday and build the best strategies with and against other players.

Here are some of the highlights of what we have developed so far:

*   7 NPCs you can fight to earn Wilderness Coins. Each of these have a different attacking style, skills and give different rewards.
*   5 Spells like Lava Rage to throw a fireball at the opponent or Ice Cold to freeze the opponent.
*   XP and Leveling system to enable long term players to get the maximum earning potential and social clout
*   Beginner and Daily Quests to give the players a smaller goal with rewards
*   A Referral System where anyone can refer a new player to help both of them earn extra coins.
*   POAPs for key achievements in the game.
*   A Clan System where Clan Masters can delegate Clan Membership to other players and earn a passive income. Clan Members get benefits in the form of exclusive team gameplay.
*   An Event everyday, and sometimes more! From daily PvP competitions to weekly extra coin Saturday, double XP Sunday, and an upcoming Magic Themed party.

**Growth**:

*   Strong and Active Community of 850+ on Discord, 1400+ on Twitter
*   25,000+ Unique Visitors in just 4 months
*   2500+ Unique Players have earned a Wilderness NFT \[many of them earned their first NFT ever]
*   Active Presence on Twitch  with Neyyyhhaa, co-founder of Wilderness, streaming regularly with an average viewership of 35+
*   $6000+ in secondary market sales creating an estimated market Cap of $40,000+ for Wilderness NFTs . We are proud to enable so many players to earn money for doing things they love.
*   The Week \[One of India’s most reputed Magazines] wrote an article about us : https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2022/04/21/the-promise-and-potential-of-play-to-earn-games-with-wilderness-P2E.html

**Limitations**:

We are continuously trying to push the limits of what can be done with Decentraland SDK from a technical standpoint, but there are certain limitations we can’t overcome at this point which lead to a not so ideal gameplay experience when you compare it to games outside of Decentraland.
We plan to combat this by continuously working with the Decentraland Foundation by providing feedback regularly and making commits in the Decentraland code.

**How does this help the DCL community?**

*   Improved experience for new users who are looking for P2E games.
*   User growth because of new users who specifically join Decentraland to play Wilderness P2E
*   Community Modules to help the entire DCL developers community
*   New Earning Opportunities for all of DCL users. Our players have already earned $6,000+ \[~ 50% of that being last month].
*   Educational Content for Decentraland : We need to educate users about Decentraland to educate them about Wilderness.


## Specification

**Budget Breakdown**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BAXwal50qgMO_EsrZqx9TBZcFWpfjj41PV5qKFXStS8/

**Tech Stack**

Solidity \[Polygon Chain Smart Contracts], TypeScript \[DCL SDK and Custom Built NodeJS Server], Blender 3D \[3D Designs and Animation], Canva and Adobe Photoshop \[2D Designs]

**Revenue and Sustainability**

As detailed in the Wilderness Whitepaper, the tokenization of Wilderness Coin \[will be achieved before the deadline for this proposal] will allow for a consistent revenue stream for the game without making it a “Pay to Win” game, which has been one of our guiding principles right from the start.
The Wilderness Treasury will receive 5% of all primary sales of Play 2 Earn Rewards in Wilderness \[These Wearables/NFTs are never sold outside of the game by the team and can only be obtained for Wilderness Coins]. The Wilderness Treasury will also receive 2.5% of all secondary sales of Wilderness NFTs across all marketplaces \[DCL, Opensea, Wilderness Marketplace]

We have been growing at a growth rate of 8% W-o-W over the last couple of months. As we improve this number and continue to grow Week over Week, we target to grow our Playerbase by a factor of 10x in the next 6 months.

Assuming that the value of Wilderness NFTs grows linearly (n) with player growth and the Secondary market trading volume grows quadratically (n^2) with player growth, we will be able to generate $20,000+ in revenue from primary sales \[5% commission] and $10,000+ in revenue from secondary sales, allowing us to be sustainable by optimizing our expenses by ~ 20%.

Plan B : If the goals we have set are not achieved, we will heavily cut down on our operating expenses. We also have the community support to be able to raise money by sale of DAO tokens, and the ability to raise funds from VCs/Angel Investors considering our background and strong execution.

Plan B is Plan B for a reason however. Decentralizing before achieving a strong Product Market fit can lead to slower pace of development and getting capital from VCs/Angels comes with its own set of problems \[giving control away to a third party that is only interested in making money]

## Description

We got 133 Yes votes on our last one! We took all the feedback from the small few that voted no and cut out a ton of things to hopefully it gets passed this time around. Here is that one for reference. Thank you! https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8439fe90-76ee-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7

Each week the course will be different and they can be completed anytime since the course will be up for the entire week. Also as we make a new course each week they will continued to be recycled through out the week that way as new people join the weekly races they will still have a chance to do past courses and win past Waifumon NFTs from before. Also the more Waifumon NFTs people collect for completing the courses they will also be able to use them to redeem other Decentraland Wearable NFTs can be seen here:

## Roadmap and milestones

Our goal is simple it's to positively benefit all levels of current Decentraland players, content creators, land owners, wearable creators, and everything metaverse as well as continue to grow the community. We have grown from just couple hundred followers to now almost 10,000 followers on twitter and 80,000 Waifumon NFT holders. We would like to continue to help grow Decentraland community by every week encouraging our community to participate in our P2E courses through our social medias and community.

15249,15249,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Delegate the Reference Client roadmap to the Decentraland Foundation,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

### Summary

Should the Decentraland DAO delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and executing the roadmap for the Reference Client?

### Abstract

The Reference Client (the app at [play.decentraland.org](https://play.decentraland.org)) is currently the most widely used Decentraland client. Right now, the Decentraland Foundation is the main contributor to the Reference Client’s open source code base, but given the DAO’s ownership of the client (and the need to have the DAO approve major changes), the Foundation is hindered in how quickly and effectively it can develop new features and improvements.

To overcome this hurdle, the Foundation is suggesting that the DAO delegate the development and maintenance of the Reference Client to the Foundation. This delegation would be reviewed and renewed every 12 months. The Foundation would provide a roadmap to the DAO to review, provide feedback on, and approve on the same 6 month schedule to help communicate to the community the Foundation’s strategic and technical priorities.

This delegation would empower the Foundation to:

*   Communicate and execute a solid roadmap both for community developers and users
*   Build a richer feature set (e.g. better in-world navigation, social interaction, and content moderation tools)
*   Ensure that the client is faster and more stable
*   Improve the quality and performance of the client’s graphics
*   Improve the client’s ability to support more concurrent users

### Background

To better understand the scope of this proposed delegation and the extent of it’s impact the broader platform, it’s important to define some terms:

**The “DAO”**

The DAO was created to help the community direct the development of the platform’s policies, infrastructure, content moderation, and smart contracts. The DAO owns the smart contracts for Decentraland’s digital assets (like LAND, Names, Wearables, etc.), so any changes made to those contracts must be approved by the DAO. Furthermore, platform-impacting decisions or changes to Decentraland’s codebase (i.e. decisions that impact the entire Decentraland community, like strategic decisions for the client) must be approved by the DAO.

**The “Decentraland Foundation”**

The Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed to help protect the intellectual property of the Decentraland brand (something that the DAO lacks the legal status to do). The Foundation was also tasked with supporting the decentralization of the platform alongside the community.

**The “Decentraland Stack”**

Decentraland is made up of a complex “stack” of different smart contracts, protocols, and applications. Together, they make up the *Decentraland Platform*. Generally speaking, the different decentralized layers can defined as:

1.  The **smart contracts** that make possible Decentraland’s scarce digital assets (like land, estates, wearables, names, etc.)
2.  The **Catalyst software** used to run the distributed network of servers that host and provide content to users.
3.  The **software development kit** that people use to build content for the world.
4.  **dApps like the Builder** that allow people to create and arrange content for the world without writing code.
5.  **dApps like the Marketplace** that allow people to manage and exchange Decentraland’s digital assets.
6.  **Clients** that allow users to interact with the content of Decentraland. Decentraland clients are like web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) in that they all provide access to the same network and information, but are not the web itself.

**The “Reference Client”**

The Decentraland Reference Client discussed in this proposal is a web based app that allows people to access and interact with content and other people within Decentraland’s virtual world. This application sits at the top of the Decentraland Stack.

It’s helpful to remember that the Reference Client does not constitute the entire Decentraland Platform, that it is just one alternative for accessing the Decentraland Platform, that anyone can develop a customized client, and that the roadmap discussed in this proposal for the Reference Client can’t dictate changes to any other components of the platform - those must still be approved by the DAO on a case by case basis.

### Specification

**Duration and renewal of the delegation**

The DAO would delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and maintaining the Reference Client for a period of 12 months, according to a roadmap approved by the DAO on a biannual schedule.

The Foundation would be responsible for writing each 6 month iteration of the roadmap, but each iteration must be approved by the DAO.

**Ideation and validation for the roadmap**

The DAO must have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.

**Deviations from the roadmap**

The Foundation would be able to reasonably depart from the roadmap to make full use of the Foundation’s familiarity with the competitive market, Decentraland’s user base, and regulatory requirements, but these departures must be later approved by the DAO as part of the biannual schedule.

**Funding development**

Funds to develop the Reference Client (e.g. payroll for developers) would still be provided by the Foundation, not the DAO.

**Termination of the delegation**

The DAO may choose at any time to revoke this delegation in favor of giving it to another entity.

**Limits of the delegation**

The delegation is limited to the Reference Client and does not allow the Foundation to make changes to other areas of the Decentraland platform (e.g. changes to the Marketplace’s smart contracts); any such changes must pass through a vote in the DAO.

### Rationale

1.  The Reference Client is a complex application that is relevant to the continued  development of the platform.
2.  The development life cycle for something as complex as the client requires countless technical and strategic decisions to be made on a daily basis
3.  Given the time it takes to write proposals and pass them through the DAO, it would be extremely impractical to have the DAO weigh in on each of these decisions
4.  So, it’s clear that in order to develop the client at a speed sufficient to compete with other metaverse projects, *at least some level of formal delegation* is needed
5.  The Foundation is the best candidate to receive this delegation given its proximity to the platform, its resources, and its knowledge of the market and the Decentraland community
6.  The suggested delegation would provide the Foundation with the autonomy needed to execute quickly, while still being subject to the relevant decisions, directions, and control of the DAO

15250,15250,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Expanding the Community Grants Program,"> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc

### Summary

This proposal aims to expand the range of grant tires in order to support teams and bigger scoped-projects.

### Abstract

Decentraland DAO opened their Community Grants program on May 31st 2021. Since then 12 grants have been given for Content Creator, Platform Contributor, Gaming and Community categories.

The current structure is aimed to single individuals:

*   Tier 1: One-time payment of $500 - $1500 USD in MANA
*   Tier 2: One-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA
*   Tier 3: Up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff.

This proposal aims to create 3 new tires designed for teams and larger scoped projects.

### Motivation

The current tires are good to fit small projects and individual contributions. If more money is needed the contributor can continue requesting further grants to keep up the good work (eg. KevinOnEarth).

In order to tackle bigger projects that require the commitment of a team for many months we need to scale our tire options. This will attract more talent to the ecosystem.

### Specification

The proposed new tires are:

*   Tire 4: Up to $60.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).
*   Tire 5: Up to $120.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).
*   Tire 6: Up to $240.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).

These tires allow a team to receive up to 10k, 20k or 40k per month for over 6 months. The amounts represent the maximum requested value per tire and it opens the possibility to request less money, for example with Tire 4 one could ask for 3k USD per month over 6 months.

It’s recommended to teams to start with small tires, get idea’s validation from the community, show some progress and later request a bigger grant to suit the escalation of operations. It will be quite harder to get DAO approval for a massive grant to an unknown team.

Teams should report progress to the DAO Facilitator which will be included in regular reports. The grants are provided via revocable vesting contracts, thus enabling the DAO to cut a program that doesn’t deliver what was promised.

### Benefits

There are many ways the DAO benefits from the success of grants:

First, if these grants add value to Decentraland’s ecosystem then MANA should get more general awareness and the price should go up, thus making the treasury of the DAO bigger. So what is good for Decentraland is good for the DAO.

Second, I would love to see projects capable of generating a revenue stream, becoming profitable ventures, and generating employment around Decentraland. Enabling more people to make a living out of Decentraland’s ecosystem is key.

Ultimately, bringing new people on board with skills and mindsets it’s a great benefit for the DAO. We need more active members. Attention and initiative are scarce resources IMHO.

With the rise in price for MANA, many users feel that an asking price of $500 MANA (at current market price) to be too high to continue with claiming a unique name on DCL. Perhaps lowering it a bit would encourage more users to claim their name, as well as remain active longer on DCL. I believe that this would encourage more user activity, and overall improve the experience an average user can have on DCL by giving them a greater sense of identity. Below is a poll that features different prices in MANA and you can vote which one seems the most reasonable/appropriate for claiming your unique name in the marketplace.

Inspired on ad blockers and block systems from other decentralized systems, and to ensure a good experience for all users, I propose the creation of a decentralized user block system.

*   Create a new setting on the client allowing users to add one or more URLs.
*   Update the client to query the URL with a standardized REST API about the block status of an ETH address, name, land or estate.

Anyone in the community will then be able to create their own block list servers, and help other members create theirs. The users will keep full control of what block service to use (and don't use).

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Hire a team to maintain and improve the Governance dApp and develop new tools (the “DAO Governance Squad”). The main goal is to increase the execution power of the DAO.

Previous Proposal: (Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO)\[https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8c144570-1803-11ec-ac84-77607720a240]


## Grant size

120,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x3bf800b6F5c987b3738432068f789b7d131F1698

## Description

This DAO Governance Squad will be the main contributor of the [Governance dApp](https://governance.decentraland.org/) and will contribute to the creation of new tools that support the operation of the DAO.

This grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months, which term may be extended for one or more similar time periods upon a further decision of the DAO.

The proposed DAO Governance Squad will be implemented as a sole-purpose, non for profit Foundation. This provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.


## Specification

The DAO Governance Squad will be set up as a Panama sole-purpose, Non-for-Profit Foundation. Costs associated with this set up are included in the Grant.

The grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures Multisig. Participants are Gino Cingolani, Yemel Jardi and Manuel Araoz in their respective capacity as Squad Lead, DAO Committee Member and Trusted Community Member.

### Conditions of the Grant

The Grant is conditioned to the satisfaction and fulfillment of each and all of the following:

*   The DAO Governance Squad shall use the funds from the Grant solely for the purpose of developing and maintaining the Governance dApp and tools to support the operations of the DAO, as described in below, in accordance with the guidelines and roadmap detailed below (“Roadmap and Milestones”).

*   The DAO Governance Squad shall set up a Multisig Wallet (the “MultiSig”), for purposes of receiving the Grant, with the signatories indicated above.
    Disbursements of the Grant shall be conditioned upon achieving the roadmap milestones and presented in the monthly reports within the timeframe set forth below.

*   The DAO Governance Squad will provide the DAO with the following information:

    *   Within five (5) days of the beginning of each month, a Monthly Progress Report regarding the development of the Governance dApp and the achievement of Milestones will be presented to the DAO Committee and DAO Facilitator.

    *   Within ten (10) days of the beginning of each month, Monthly Financial Report showing use of the proceeds of the Grant.

    *   Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the annual financial statements of the DAO Governance Squad in case there are more extensions of this Grant.

    *   Representatives of the DAO Governance Squad shall meet with representatives of the Decentraland Foundation and/or DAO Committee, acting for the benefit and upon the implicit instruction of the DAO, to provide technical updates and answer legal and financial questions regarding the use of the Grant.

*   The Intellectual Property Rights over the Governance dApp shall be owned by the Decentraland Foundation, acting for the benefit of the LAND and MANA communities. In the event that in the future it is legally feasible for the DAO to hold the Intellectual Property Rights over the Governance dApp, theDAO Governance Squad or the Decentraland Foundation, as applicable, shall execute the relevant documents. For purposes hereof, “Intellectual Property Rights” means (whether or not registered in any jurisdiction) copyrights, trade secrets and patents, all other proprietary rights recognized under applicable law and all applications and registrations as well as the right to file all applications and registrations for, or relating to, all of the foregoing, in connection with the Governance dApp.

*   The Governance dApp must be compliant with the Terms of Use, Content Policy and Privacy Policy of Decentraland, as updated from time to time.

*   Upon failure to comply with any of the conditions of above by the DAO Governance Squead, the vesting contract will be revoked by the DAO, returning unvested funds.


## Personnel

The proposed team of the DAO Governance Squad is the following:

*   Senior Product Manager - Gino Cingolani ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginocingolani) ,  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ginocingolani))

*   Senior Product Designer - Juan Ruiz Echazu ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyimjuani/) ,  [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/juani) ,  [Github](https://github.com/heyimjuani))

*   Senior Full Stack Developer - Juan Pablo Arnaudo ([Github](https://github.com/jparnaudo) ,  [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jparnaudo/))

*   Semi-senior Front-end Developer - To be defined

*   Semi-senior Technical Copywriter - To be defined

Total Hours: ~360 monthly hours or ~80 weekly hours.\`
Budget: 20.000 USD per month, including payroll and operational expenses.

As stated above, this will be structured as a non-profit foundation so the DAO Governance Squad will basically cover the cost of providing this service.

The positions for Semi-senior Front-end Developer and Semi-senior Technical Writer are still open and we are looking for candidates. If you are interested, write to me via Discord or forum DM.


## Roadmap and milestones

Initially, the team will focus on the following 3 points:

*   Engagement: Better ways to engage with the governance process.
*   Transparency: Provide more information and accountability.
*   Automation: Simplify recurrent tasks, reduce human operation.

These guidelines can be broken down into actionable steps like:

*   Automate generation of reports.
*   Ease and automate DAO Committee operations.
*   Add a Treasury page showing stats of the current treasury.
*   Add a Grants page showing all grants that have been or are being funded by the DAO.
*   Add a Members page listing current teams and members.
*   Load forum comments on the proposal to encourage discussion.
*   Implement automatic status updates of proposals in the forum.
*   Work on reports on technical viability about discussed proposals.
*   Implement content moderation tools for the community, DAO Facilitator, and DAO Committee to help filter out offensive, poorly defined, or spammy proposals.
*   Improve the proposal creation process by adding new proposal categories for common actions in the DAO.
*   Advance the grant program to include larger grants with a more robust vetting and oversight process.

The team will follow agile development practices to ensure the fast implementation of DAO governance requirements and the continuous improvement of such features. The team will host open meetings with members of the DAO to gather feedback, answer questions and provide updates at least every 90 days.

Hello,

I made this hair wearable and used the name “Goku”. I wasn't expecting the name could have some intellectual property infringement, because I thought names cannot be copyrighted (like “alex”, “Paul” etc.) as well as classic hairstyle. Please vote yes and help me bring my first wearable to Decentraland.

Unfortunately it is not possible to change the collection name once it is submitted.
However, since I put a lot of work into my very first wearable I am willing to resubmit it with a different name. This vote is just to make sure, if my wearable would be approved in case of resubmitting.

Here is the initial wearable submission:

There are many of the same wearable's that are listed again and again (sometimes by different owners) while trying to scroll down to look for new types of wearable's. To maintain the uniqueness of even the common wearable's the marketplace needs to classify all of the same wearable's as one and provide one link for all the different people selling the same wearable on that one page that may come after you click the marketplace link for that particular wearable with all the sellers and their separate prices. This will help keep the Marketplace cleaner. Anyone who searches enough to buy wearable's understands this. \[ A good common wearable sold again and again can flood the marketplace collectibles page with that particular wearable itself ]

Respectable developers,
Please push this slight improvement through

- One link for one type of wearable and all sellers of that wearable listed under there with their different pricing.
- Keep looking at the same wearable listed again and again in the marketplace
- Invalid question/options

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Our mission at The Decentraland Report is to preserve the history of our unfolding metaverse. As a Participate-To-Earn Experience unified under this common mission, we have grown into a team of Reporters who stream daily to ensure every day in Decentraland is captured for future generations to reflect on.
What allows our community to contribute their valuable time to our Report is the incentives they earn for doing so.
Over the course of the first year, every aspect of our Participate-to-Earn system was managed manually by KevinOnEarth999 to viewers and reporters; NFT/Crypto/Wearable Rewards. This grant we will create features to automate those processes.
https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/


## Grant size

120,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xa4244F6711052752E6Bb0271Bf17c756E6598406

## Description

More members of our community have requested spots as Reporters, however with all the existing processes depending on manual execution by a single person it will be impossible to keep up with.

Our goal in this next stage is to Decentralize the Viewer/Reporter rewards system to remove the need for one person, KevinOnEarth999, to execute and manage the processes necessary to maintain The Decentraland Report. In this way, we will ensure the ongoing preservation of our history through The Decentraland Report, and via the $REPORT token and our DAO we will be able to continue to decide as a community what direction to take. The Decentraland Report belongs to the people of Decentraland. This next step is crucial to furthering that ownership so in theory, we can continue to watch history unfold in our report for generations to come.

It is for these reasons that the following features have been identified as “must haves” in order to ensure a trustless automated reward system for The Decentraland Report. More importantly, our approach to developing these features through our partnership with Xpang.GG, will also allow any other community in Decentraland to leverage the same FOR FREE! In other words, our mission here will not only serve our community at The Decentraland Report, but every other community as well.

Tune in to our 1 Year Birthday Special where we announced our plans, and tokenomics doc! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS0M9dmEAF0

Instead of creating a tool from scratch, we will add it as a feature to the Xpand.GG Community pages. The same way we solved the problem of counting score for NFTuesday, while also giving this feature to others, is how we aim to solve the problem of rewards distribution for communities. We can accomplish the above by building the following features listed in a detailed way in our Gitbook page:
https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/what-we-are-building-now/overview


## Specification

The following features will be developed on so anyone can access them as well for their communities, via Xpand.GG

Automating Distribution for Reporter (Moderator) Token Rewards: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/what-we-are-building-now/reporter-token-rewards

When logging into Decentraland users start in the Day visual mode. Many regular users of DCL prefer the night mode, however often forget to change it when relogging in.
Therefore, should the default view mode be changed from Day mode to Night mode?

Since last November, the price of MANA has gone down from $5 to roughly $1.

This proposal is to stop this change from happening on May 26th, so that we can hold another vote and create a new proposal that addresses how fees should be assessed based on current market conditions.

15261,15261,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Representing third-party NFTs as wearables in Decentraland,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Summary**

A proposed implementation for the submission, approval, and in-world representation of third-party NFTs as wearables.

**Abstract**

One ideal of metaverses is interoperability. Web3 has given people more agency over their digital identities and the assets they own, but as more people purchase art from NFT projects like [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/), there is an increasing desire to bring these assets into other corners of the metaverse. In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.

The following solution would require third-parties (i.e. original creators of an NFT project) to apply to the DAO to be “registered” within Decentraland. Approved third parties would be added to a Third Party Registry (TPR): a smart contract deployed to Polygon.

Third-parties would then be able to upload the 3D assets needed to represent their NFTs in Decentraland. Items should still be vetted by the Wearables Curtation Committee. All approved items would then be logged in the TPR with a unique identifier (URN).

This solution requires some work from the third parties. Each would have to build a “resolver” mapping their NFTs to the corresponding items in the TPR. This resolver would need to expose a standardized API endpoint that a Decentraland client could call whenever a player opens their backpack.

The mapping between NFTs and item URNs is up to the third party. For example, since the resolver is built by the third party, the response to the Decentraland client could be customized to return one URN for an NFT, or one URN for multiple NFTs.

**These third-party representations of ""source"" NFTs would be different from current Decentraland wearables:**

*   The publication fees should vary depending on the size of the collection.
*   It would be impossible for these representations to be exchanged (in either a primary or secondary sale) in *any* marketplace *independently* from the source NFT. These new items are only 3D representations of the source NFT, and do not have their own corresponding token that can be traded.

**Specification**

First, some quick definitions:

**Third Party**

The original creator of the external NFT.

**Source NFT**

A specific NFT within a collection of external NFTs made by a third party. For example: CryptoKitties, Apes from BAYC, etc.

**Item**

The asset, or in-world representation, for a source NFT. These are identified in the TPR by a unique identifier (URN).

**Collection**

A collection of items that all belong to the same theme of NFTs. (e.g. apes from BAYC)

**Item Slot**

One of a limited number of potential representations that Third Parties may use. Item slots are bought in tiers for MANA.

**Third Party Registry (TPR)**

The smart contract deployed to Polygon that stores the list of approved third parties and the items that represent their NFTs.

**Third Party Resolver**

An API built by a third party that allows clients to verify which source NFTs are owned by the player and which item representations correspond with those NFTs that can be rendered in-world.

**Process overview**

**Application phase**

Third-party NFT projects propose the addition of a collection to the Decentraland DAO. These DAO proposals should have their own category within the governance dApp, and they should have a minimum threshold of 1M VP voting in favor (similar to grants) needed to pass.

**A voting period**

DAO members should be able to vote on whether or not to include the new third-party collection. The voting period should last 1 week, like other proposal categories.

**Collection registration**

Approved collections are added to the TPR deployed to Polygon. This is done by the DAO Committee.

**Collection management**

After a collection is approved by the DAO and registered in the TPR, the third-party may add, edit, and manage items within the collection. All of this management will be done via a new UI exposed in the Builder available to approved third parties.

**Purchasing item slots**

Part of the collection management stage is the process of buying item slots for a collection. These slots can be purchased in batches in exchange for MANA.

The size of the batches and price function should be determined in a separate proposal.

**Item approval**

Like all wearables, items must be reviewed and approved by the Wearables Curation Committee. Items must be “locked” by the third-party before they can be approved by the curation committee. As collections of third party NFTs might include thousands of items, members of the curators committee should be permitted to sample specific items before approving items in batches. It would be unrealistic to review items individually.

**Item registration**

All items are uploaded and edited by third party managers (addresses given “manager” permissions in the Builder) before they are added to the TPR. Items added to the TPR are then reviewed by the Wearables Curation Committee.

**Deployment**

Wearable models and textures are uploaded to the catalyst network after ensuring each URN has been added to the TPR. This results in an address check either via a subgraph or a check to the TPR contract itself.

**Resolution**

Third parties are responsible for developing their own API endpoint mapping their NFTs to the item URNs in the TPR. This endpoint’s shape should follow a predefined standard to avoid one-off integrations. Furthermore, the logic behind this endpoint and any interaction with other smart contracts would be outside the scope of Decentraland’s involvement. Full legal responsibility lies with the third party to ensure that they only interact with smart contracts whose IP they’re permitted to use.

**For a visual overview of the collection creation, approval, deployment, and resolution flow [see this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znwxC35wg6kzksvqP3pCMiJ2D-DwgtF3/view?usp=sharing).**

**Additional comments**

*   While this implementation could support any form of asset, the first use-case is wearables for avatars based on PFP NFTs.
*   The goal isn’t to make external NFTs compatible with Decentraland, but to create new representations within Decentraland that are linked with external NFTs.
*   The Curation Committee is responsible only for approving *items* submitted by third parties. The DAO would approve the addition of new third parties.
*   The Curation Committee always has the ability to reject specific items, all items within a collection, and all items from a Third Party creator should the resolver provide incorrect data, or no data at all, to the client
*   Items won’t exist inside traditional wearable collections, won’t have rarity, and cannot be sold in primary or secondary sales. They are only in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the TPR.

**Should the suggested implementation for wearable representations of third party NFTs be developed by the Foundation?**

15264,15264,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should the marketplace add additional features for estate sales?,"> by 0x0edf2509c504c32d5305a7ea644524c579a97a70 (Groo)

Buying and selling estates can be challenging.  In particular since Opensea has no support for transaction on estates.  To even place a bid on an estate using the DCL marketplace costs $75-$125 in gas (whereas bidding on parcels with Opensea, for example, is free).

In order for the continued growth of the DCL land economy, additional marketplace features should be implemented in order to make estate sales more accessible to users.

**Should we add additional features for estates transactions on the DCL Marketplace:**

*   Add additional search filters for estate size and cost per parcel.  It could also be accomplished with sorting options, depending on whichever is easier to implement.
*   Show cost per parcel in the summary section of the search results (in the list view)
*   Investigate options to provide off-chain ""bid intentions""- a way to gauge the interest of the other party in a bid before spending $100 on it.

## Abstract

At the highest level, the intent of the marketplace is to “virtualize” all of the Decentraland dApps and integrate them into the virtual world. Our team believes that a truly immersive experience begins by keeping as much of the Decentraland experience in-world as possible, including native DAO and Marketplace features, without requiring you to leave your Decentraland browser tab or client experience. Our goal is to have 100% of the market.decentraland.org functionality inside Decentraland and available freely to everyone, as well as to create a community hub for socialization and trade.

## Description

Upon spawning into Decentraland, you find that a mysterious envelope has appeared in your inventory. You examine its exterior and notice a gold-tinged seal with a coin-shaped sigil embossed into it. Suddenly, the seal springs open and grains of sand fly out in a flurry around you. Moments later, after you’ve regained your senses, you realize that you’re in a completely new area of the world – somewhere massive, surreal, sandy, and bustling with life.

“Welcome, human, to the marketplace,” a peculiar voice calls from an alley behind you, “I see you received my letter. Come, this way...” they say as their wrinkly, bejeweled finger beckons you to follow.

**Description**

Full doc -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10gLDguQpjONSHXQZe6\_aO9DopUoWXMC3e4Jp4xzYAi8/edit?usp=sharing

The marketplace at its core will address three common-sense problems that have yet to be implemented into the Decentraland experience: trying on and purchasing Marketplace items as a User, showcasing created items to sell in Storefronts as a Creator, and participating in the DAO as a Voter. The Decentraland Foundation is hard at work on many areas for the platform, so it’s time the community steps up to help build out this much-desired in-game functionality.

The DCL platform has been around since 2018, yet we still purchase in-game items (clothing, land, names, nfts) and vote for change through our browsers rather than inside the world of Decentraland. The marketplace aims to provide an improved experience to users by offering a free way to purchase and sell items in-game without ever having to leave the game world or pull up a second window.

The Decentraland Foundation has put a lot of effort into creating such an amazing platform for us all to meet, create, and explore. However, they must also rely on the community for innovation given the scale of the world. Our proposal aims to take some burden off the Foundation by building out these in-game purchasing experiences while also building amazing immersive content for the entire community. Being transparent, yes, it is already possible to sell wearables on your land in Decentraland. However, doing so remains a technical feat for most that requires an advanced skill set as well as land to deploy to. Doing so also lacks cohesion across a broader Marketplace vision that the marketplace seeks to accomplish through its initial Phase I deliverables.

In addition to the core functionality of the marketplace, our proposal touches on two gamification points: content creation and user retention. Through quests, storylines, factions, level progression, secret unveilings, in-game rewards, event spaces, and additional core activations such as future minigame(s), the marketplace will provide Decentraland users with engaging content that continues to evolve in complexity over time.

The marketplace is proposed to be 20x20 parcels (400 total) in size, which is the same scale as Genesis Plaza — that’s 1,102,223 square feet, 25.3 acres, or just over 19 football fields. The proposed location of the marketplace will be one of the two existing duplicate Plazas within Decentraland. Having a duplicate plaza is a redundant use of 400 parcels and there is currently no dedicated team at the Foundation to support the ongoing development of Genesis Plaza or its periphery.

This proposal, along with our proven team of dedicated creators, plan to transform this duplicate plaza into the marketplace vision laid before you.


## Specification

**Phase 1 Deliverables**

**The Oasis Central Hub**

The Oasis Central Hub, currently dubbed simply the Hub or Oasis, will be the primary entrypoint for anyone teleporting to the marketplace and is located at the absolute center of the plaza. It will be the largest piece of open air architecture and will act as the center for all marketplace-related content. Think of main online areas from Ralph Breaks the Internet and Ready Player One, or perhaps even RuneScape’s Grand Exchange for reference:

Aside from being a social center, the Hub will provide multiple “Info Desks” where Users will be able to obtain area information, see new item releases, and virtually search for wearables to discover, try on, and purchase from the Marketplace. Another part of the Hub will be the “Quest Desk” which will be touched on later. There will also be open gathering spaces for players to hang out, socialize, discuss trades/quests/etc. Additional planned interactivity includes various NPCs, custom signage, possible ‘secret’ quests, and a live visual $MANA feed to name a few.

**The Marketplace Fields & Storefronts**

The marketplace fields will be organized into 4 quadrants around the Oasis Hub that will be populated with virtual Storefronts for all Creators. At the time of initial launch, 2 of the fields will be publicly open with the other 2 fields reserved for future expansion. Storefronts will initially focus on displaying primary sale products, but we plan to support secondary sale displays at a later date.

Each field is huge – think of a massive flea market that looks like Dune meets Star Wars, or the RPO Columbus Stacks meets a Middle Eastern Marketplace type-of-feel). Each marketplace Field will have a unique look and feel while still blending with the surrounding context of the plaza. Here is our current reference imagery for the field vision:

Storefronts will be free. To be eligible for a Storefront, the associated Creator wallet address must have at least one creation published on the Marketplace for a minimum of 30 days, however this logic is subject to change based on community feedback. As more collections are introduced, more Storefronts will be dynamically added to the ever-expanding Marketplace Fields stacks. Over time, this will create an evolving form of dynamic architecture. Here’s our initial proof of concept that is still in development with a lot of room for expansion:

Storefronts will be modular in design and Marketplace Creators will have the ability to choose from various visual layouts and styles. Marketplace visitors will be able to walk between each Storefront to discover new creators, collections, and explore what else the Marketplace Fields will offer. Our current implementation for each Storefront takes advantage of openly-available data via The Graph to verify all Creator wallets.

**Quests & Beyond**

Speaking of additional content, aside from the core goals of the Marketplace, we also have numerous immersive experiences planned that we believe will bring Users back again and again to streamline ongoing engagement and a sense of progress (similar to other P2E games in Decentraland, however, this will not be a P2E game). There will be reward and leveling systems to incentivize further engagement within the Marketplace that will go hand in hand with quests:

For Phase I, there are 4 public quests planned:

## Roadmap and milestones

Projects of this scope have many parallel horizontal paths of development, and estimating precise milestones has proven cumbersome on past projects, especially when discovery is part of the process. However, Last Slice has never failed to deliver on-time and over-expectation, and we intend to maintain that track record.

With that said, we have every intention to be as transparent as possible throughout the development process. We plan to have a public Discord server for the scene setup, as well as to have it be monitored by familiar community members. We plan to have weekly live sessions with our builders behind the scenes and voice chats of our modeling and building progression. We as a group will regularly communicate our status through social channels like Twitter and Instagram, and are open to receiving input from the community at any point along the way. Progress and updates will be officially documented moving forward to display the history and growth of the Marketplace. This will allow for the community to follow along and stay in touch with the new developments on the build. Those of us at Last Slice find this to be crucial given that open community dialogue is a driving force inherent to Web3.

**Budget Breakdown**

3D Design & Modeling - 40% or $96,000

Programming - 40% or $96,000

Audio Programming - 5% or $12,000

Quest Team - 8% or $19,200

Soft Skills - 7% or $16,800

\*Soft skills includes discord, social media, video editing, proposal design, PM

It seems like the white background color of the events page does not let images of the upcoming events POP OUT. I suggest we all vote on a color for that right now and let the developer community decide the shade of that color to make user experience more meaningful.

## Description

It is a resubmission of our [previous grant proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=29559bb0-ab37-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231).
We didn't reach a threshold last time but collected a lot of support from the community. One month has passed and we want to share the progress we made during that time:

### From the roadmap we have posted in the last proposal:

*   **MultiPlayer**: The first version of multiplayer is ready and deployed. Players can play against each other. We implemented more rules for more realistic gameplay.
*   The first iteration of the **new UI** in union style (instead of the free stock version) is ready. [You can see it here](https://www.figma.com/file/FSYwJGUFDYb9Ve3ApbS6Dg/8MetaBalls?node-id=0%3A1). We are turning the design into the code, and it will be on the scene within a week.
*   **Events with the daily prizes**: Started $ prizes event ""Leader of the day"" - the leader of the day counts by total internal currency earned getting $ reward + internal stuff reward.
*   **PvP tournament** prepared and made by community members will start on 15 May.
*   One **SDK dev joined the team** full-time.
*   The graphic designer joined the team for half-day **for UI building** and marketing stuff.
*   **Analytics**. We deployed the second iteration of analytics a couple of weeks ago. Now we can see all things players interact with on the scene and in-game.
*   **A few interesting numbers from it**:
    *   Players spend about **100 hours daily playing pool** - total time played in-game (counts by seconds of the game, excluding time when players just stay on the scene and don't play). It's more than four days on average of raw gameplay in a day.
    *   Some quick conclusions from the first look at analytics allowed us to make immediate changes in the game and [make players happier](https://twitter.com/TonyMo74/status/1518520837871132672).
        Sure the example on the link is pretty simple, but it’s huge for daily players. We’ve gone further and now we are making more changes based on analytics.
*   We are one of **the most popular scenes by CCU** in DCL.
    Sharing 4th place with Genesis Plaza from time to time.

### Invisible things under the hood are already done and in progress:

*   Significant physics improvement. It's become more realistic. And we are continuously working on it.
*   All physics and gameplay logic for PvP mode moved from the scene to a server for more robust work and prevented bots from cheating.
*   Separate server to serve PvP mode since all calculations are in the server.
*   Since the new dev joined the team, a ton of code was refactored to work together and onboard new devs in the future much more smoothly.
*   Many reusable modules/components for further development like permission module (to get access for different mechanics and features), level builder, network debugger, etc
*   PvC mode improvements.
*   New classic levels to arcade mode & new Arcade mode with obstacle
*   We are also preparing a new arcade ""crazy mode"" - with unusual table shapes and unusual physics.
*   Cue-sticks - visual improvements, animation of hit, different guidelines based on cue level, gameplay improvement, more accurate aiming with a red-dotted ball, ability to make complex hits, cue wear and repair, etc.


## Specification

Six months of development have passed in one day. The game has started from ""let's try what SDK can do now"" (I haven't touched it since it was on babylon.js in 2018) to the team with four members working full time on the project, a few people working part-time, thousands of players, and great feedback from the community.

We are still committed to the roadmap from the last proposal, but I want to explain my vision to high-level points we want to work on.

*   **Numbers of players** - obviously, the more players play the game, the more successful it is. The number one goal is to grow DAU, WAU, MAU, and CCU metrics.
    We plan to achieve it through different game modes, such as PvP, PvC, Tournaments, Pools Clubs, and a few types of Arcade modes. Marketing activity and Events. Adding more game mechanics and social interactions. Bring more utility-based NFT and wearables.

*   **Developing the codebase**. Two devs are working on the project so far. I and a new TypeScript SDK Dev who joined our team full-time this month. We need one more dev for a backend, DevOps, CI/CD, server stuff, and one more SDK dev for scene development.

*   **Visual part.** Improving the visible part of the scene and game. New 3D buildings, tables, chests, boards, cues, interior & exterior design. 2D UI development. Sound improvement.

*   **Internal economics/game balance & monetization.** The most exciting part. We already have a dual currency economy with stimulus to achieve rewards and possibilities to spend it in exchange for different game items. But it's still in the early stage. Here we plan to add significantly more ways to achieve rewards, a bunch of ways to spend them. Add user retention mechanics like game chests, daily super-games, loot boxes, and collection items. Add more NFT with in-game utility, such as cue chalk(which prevents bad hits), gloves (makes hits more accurate), etc.

*   **Continue to develop analytics.** The most important part. To achieve the goals, we have to understand what's going on. Which mechanics increase our metrics, and how do different changes affect them. Eventually, build ""adult metrics"" of acquisition, engagement, and monetization such as stickiness rate, churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, ATV, etc.

*   **Game Center.** The long-term goal is to transform a single-game scene (8MetaBalls) into a Game center with multiple games covering different interests and audiences.
    And combine these games into one unified economy.
    I am already creating PoC for several games in my spare time. But our primary efforts are the development of 8MetaBalls so far. When we achieve all the things I've mentioned above, it will be much easier and faster to deliver additional games and embed them into the scene and economics.


## Personnel

*   **Tony - core dev**: Former marketing lead in retail & e-commerce(long ago). TS/Phyton/C#/Solidity developer. Former core dev in a private quantitative crypto fund. From 2021 went deeper into DeFi, DAO, chains stuff. The finalist of Binance DeFi CIS Hackaton in April 2021. From the end of 2021 whole day in Decentraland development.

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

**Golfcraft is a popular minigolf Play to Earn game in Decentraland**.

We released an early open beta that everyone can play at the [coordinates 47,-45](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=47%2C-45).

To date **we have 5000 monthly active users, maintaining a consistent position between the 5 most visited scenes in Decentraland**. And recently we started to receive income from the in-game shop.

Since we allowed users to claim wearables using in-game points, more than 500 wearables were distributed!

Now that the core mechanics have proven to work we want to improve the experience to attract and retain even more users.


## Grant size

120,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x60297Cfec1d6941510A4573d6eE994d1b69fa656

## Description

Play to Earn is a key element to onboard and retain new users to Decentraland.

**With Golfcraft we are set to build one of the top P2E experiences in Decentraland**, and creating a polished experience requires a vast amount of work and resources.

Minigolf has some core advantages, it's easy to understand, and can be implemented in Decentraland keeping the game fair and difficult to bot.

But building this project is not an easy task, requiring game design, level design, UX, smart contract development, visual design (both 2D and 3D), system administration, security, community management, marketing, business infrastructure and more.

**With this grant we will be able to focus on 3 key components of the game: visual quality, P2E economy and bug fixing.**

*   To improve the visual quality we will be outsourcing the work to [Polygonal Mind](https://www.polygonalmind.com/), the renowned studio behind Cryptoavatars, Megacube and countless amazing buildings around Decentraland.

*   We will expand the p2e economy by allowing players to craft their own golf courses, and obtain passive income from them.

*   And we will work on refactoring the code of the game to fix current bugs and prevent future ones.


## Specification

We use Colyseus to run the game logic on an authoritative server, running the physics simulation and game logic. We currently have 2 servers to minimize latency, and we are planning to add more soon.

We have additional servers to keep track of player inventory and progress, and to process transactions for purchases and NFT distribution.

For the NFTs and the shop we use Polygon, to allow gas free transactions. Our players earn their first NFT ever spending $0.

And we use TheGraph to index and query the data generated by our smart contracts.

## Abstract

**Golfcraft is a free-to-earn and build-to-earn game for Decentraland we have been working on in the last year and half.**

Our vision is to empower the community to decide the market prices, minting NFTs at not cost and trading them on OpenSea.

We have different player types, some improving their game every day, others building golf courses or organizing tournaments; each of them being able to generate resources for themselves in a passive or active way.

While creating Golfcraft we established OhMyVerse, a company dedicated to create experiences for the metaverse.

**With the help of this grant our goal is to continue dedicating 100%  of our effort to improve Decentraland creating engaging content.**

## Description

Some time ago the DCL community trusted us with a [Tier 5 grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f7459b10-46e2-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5), after several months of hard work we are currently completing the last milestone: adding the golf course editor!

**While building the game, the scene received a continuous traffic of users and we had some experiences to remember:**

*   A [course builder contest](https://twitter.com/GolfcraftGame/status/1522002489574408192) where our users had the opportunity to [express themselves](https://twitter.com/GolfcraftGame/status/1529770383422939137).
*   The launch of a new [Building designed by Polygonal Mind](https://twitter.com/GolfcraftGame/status/1510027642774433800) hosting a treasure hunt coordinated with different influencers and communities.
*   Intense competition events.
*   Collaborations with several community wearable designers: [Aeyon](https://twitter.com/SmilleAeyon), [Tobik](https://twitter.com/TobikCC), [SparkleStudios](https://twitter.com/studio_sparkles), [PolygonalMind](https://twitter.com/polygonalmind), [Doki](https://twitter.com/DokiDCL), [DuckiezKing](https://twitter.com/DuckiezKing).
*   A [12 week league](https://twitter.com/helpimstreaming/status/1508489190404771844) and other independent events driven by streamers like [helpimstreaming](https://twitter.com/helpimstreaming), [LucasCol](https://twitter.com/Lucascol\_), [BobysBongZ](https://twitter.com/BobysBongZ) and their communities.

In the next quarter **our plan is to complete the most important pillar for Golfcraft: Crafting mechanics**. Allowing players to gather materials, and craft Parts and Courses with them.

Once done we will have the last part of the structure and the base for building a carefully designed game in decentraland to be proud of.
The list of NFTs a player will be able to mint/claim in the game are:

*   Golf clubs
*   Wearables
*   Refined materials (from wood, stone, iron and gold)
*   Fashion tickets
*   Diamonds
*   Golf course parts
*   Golf courses
*   Compicactus
*   Voxters

We have been making the game as bot resistant as possible, using an authoritative server for the game logic and physic simulation.

We, as the OhMyVerse company, are committed to work in this three core values to attract users to Decentraland: social, building and investment. Our goal will be focused on those aspects, considering “social” the most important to work on the immediate future.

**Our plan is to go beyond a golf/builder game and provide more activities around it to strengthen the social aspect.**

Having support from the DAO allows us to make more attractive content, with more accessibility to those users with lack of resources, and to give the community the control over the crafting resources at Golfcraft.

We already have a productive team able to deliver a top product, with a plan to grow thanks to the help from the DAO, and to provide even more good content to make Decentraland more attractive.


## Specification

The Golfcraft game is composed of different services and servers:

*   Authoritative servers for gameplay and physics reproduction, using Colyseus, placed in the United States and Europe, wanting to provide another in Asia to improve the experience due to websocket connection latency.
*   In-house developed bridge service to move resources from game to blockchain and vice versa.
*   In-house indexing service to handle variables which would be expensive and slow to manage directly via smart-contract / blockchain.
*   A dApp to create tournaments from the web https://golfcraftgame.com .
*   A service to manage competition groups.
*   An administration panel.
*   A service plus addon to export golf course parts (models and physics) from Blender.
*   Playfab integration.
*   Customized smart contracts for each NFT on the game. The golf courses being an ERC-721 NFTs able to contain ERC-1155 golf course parts.
*   Crafting smart-contract to convert refined materials into golf course parts.
*   Service to mint wearables, golf clubs and to deliver NFTs from storage addresses.
*   TheGraph indexation for different contracts.

Golfcraft is, of course, already available to [play here](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=47%2C-45).

## Description

WHAT WE SOLVE OF PROBLEMS AND GAINS FOR DECENTRALAND

*   Better user-experience for new users
*   We onboard tons of new people, and answer their questions regarding the best Metaverse Decentraland
*   We help generate income and new business to Decentraland
*   We help land gets REAL content. We connect P2E games, NFT galleries, Meta Breweries and much more to land-owners
*   We need it to be EASY to be a consumer & content creator in DCL.
*   Prevent scamming and advising users properly.

We're ready to do our part to IMPROVE Decentraland, and bring growth and income to the Decentraland foundation, on the same time we bring value to the platform, so we can continue being the best metaverse in the world.

On a short notice:

*   We want to create the best Rental Experience in Decentraland, where land-owners easily can become ""landlords"". Way too much land are empty. We need content, exciting areas and places to visit to make sure we continue grow our platform. We are solving this with our Realtor Rental Platform. We need a smart-contract to ensure the transperency, security and easy-ness to make sure Decentraland Rentals are accessable to all.

And YES, we know there are platforms like Double and LandWorks - but they are not the biggest, most active and have the same level of live-chat-support (and even video-calls) like DCL Real Estate does. This is why DCL Real Estate is now requesting a grant from the great and amazing community and DAO in Decentraland.
We will provide a technical great solution, which is already in the making. It will be easy to get answers from resources from our Decentraland Experts.. Most users leave the DCL community because they don't understand how our world works - this is why Agents and Trusted Advisors are important.

This is why we propose, the DAO help us funding our DCL REAL ESTATE RENTAL PLATFORM v2. We're the biggest and best Realtor in Decentraland with most results, and we ask you to help us.

With this grant, we will be able to create the best rental-platform, that Decentraland has seen. Even more it will have features such as LIVE SUPPORT, Land advise, Scene catalog, Free Scenes to publish, Verified scene makers with live support and best of all - as thanks for the grant we will give back Decentraland and the DAO - 5% in commission on EVERY sale/rental we get on the platform.

DCL Real Estate is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get users to interact with the platform in Decentraland, which means use the land as content creation, get buyers and tenants to meet the landlords and sellers, and create a better Decentraland.

A short introduction about us - DCL Real Estate is the biggest and one of the first realtors in Decentraland. We provide services such as “Selling”, “buying” and “renting land” services.

We’re onboarding new users to Decentraland every day, and we keep on being one of the first encounters on many occasions when people explore how they can get started building and further grow Decentraland, with lands and content. With granting us the funds we will be able to grow the land- and rental market within Decentraland, and on the same time making DCL Real Estate decentralized through giving DAO shares, on 5% on every sale. We will appoint a board to adjust our own rate and commission, so it's fair and affordable. (Cheaper than today) Most likely 2,5% to 10% to the realtor platform.


## Specification

Blockchain: Ethereum

Tools:
vscode, hardhat, metamask for smart contract
React, redux, tailwind for website
React, redux, react native for app

Issue: the community is riddled with scammers within a peer to peer transactional space. This results in lower trust in Decentraland, and therefore less community usage and interaction. It also empowers easy access to rent, with possibility to access a Trusted Advisor who knows the DCL space, and on the same time access utilities such as a free scene - and income to the DAO which means the people of Decentraland.

Solution: this rental smart contract will provide additional comfort for land owners and prospective buyers/renters, as they will no longer have to worry about being scammed. We will become an added small business within decentraland, bring additional volume, and showing evidence of successful business operations within a leading metaverse platform.

Users can easily:

1.Tenants can easily rent lands easy on the site
2.Landlords can list their lands easy on the site.
\---> Free Scene access
\---> Premium Scenes access
\---> Live Support from DCL Experts (Building experts, Land experts, General support)
\---> Help to increase security and prevent scam
\---> 5% commission to DAO/DCL on each sale/rental.

THE PROCESS TO RENT (As a Tenant)
1.User connect wallet
2.User find the wanted land, and press ""rent land"" and pay's (For example 1-12 months)
3.Landlord automaticly get's operator assigned to tenant's address or manually add another operator
4.Money gets in Escrow wallet
5.Money gets released after 30 days to landlord (+ DAO fee and Platform fee's withdrawn)
6.Tenant will automatic pay every 30 days, and the lease will end if payment has failed, and other tenants will be able to access and rent the landlords' land.

THE PROCESS TO LEASE (As a Land-owner/Landlord)
1.User connect wallet
2.User press ""List land"" choose how much they want to earn, rental period etc.
3.Landlord signs smart-contract.

IMPORTANT TO NOTICE:
A landowner can ALWAYS remove operator or sell a land. It is not possible to make sure they can't, so this is a fully secure rental-system which will provide security for the tenant's funds, and landlord's land asset. This is why this project DO NOT transfer any land-nft-asset but simply acts as a money-middleman, and takes a fee for doing it automatic, easy and cheap. If a landlord/landowner proceed to remove operator/sell the land after renting it out, the tenant will be refunded, and the land-owners' address will be noticed as a ""Bad Landlord"".

DAO will get income from the sales and rentals, aswell as the landlord and realtor platform fee's.

Payments and commissions to DAO will be sent to:
Either DAO directly: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a6ebe7e2a7722f8200d0ffb63a1f6406a0d7dce

Or Multisig owned by the DAO Committee (Yemel and HPrivakos): https://etherscan.io/address/0x89214c8Ca9A49E60a3bfa8e00544F384C93719b1

We will make the smart-contract and address changeable, because DAO is still new and it's growing fast so we might need to change in the future, after advise from DAO committee members.

## Roadmap and milestones

This project will be completed within 6 weeks-6months.

And the roadmap is as follows:

Month 1-3: Development of the FUTURE of Rental platform. UI and UX designing, Smart Contract Development & Website app creation

Month 4: Code Audition

Month 5: Internal Testing, Debug and Code Polish. Also development of resources, tips, tricks, videos and onboarding to platform and DCL.

Month 6: Official launch and income generating

We strive to make the project release before it's due. But it's important EVERYTHING is perfect, and make sure the quality of the project.

To keep track of all of the related update, we'll release reports and share them on our Discord & in the DAO grant community on their discord: https://discord.gg/XBjCRTbRZP - but we will also be ready to answer questions on the forum and on email.

The DCL Real Estate already implemented rentals and sold results for more than 30+ clients and smart contracts will make rewards and security better and easier combined with advisory to new users of DCL to make Decentraland the best Metaverse, so it makes sense for DAO to do this execution. The funds will go entirely to the community through commission on rentals.

We're ready for the future of Real Estate and the rental market in Decentraland. Help us, by helping Decentraland building it. Are you ready for it?

Thank you for reading✅.

15275,15275,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,For Decentraland Daily Active Users: MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP,"> by 0xbef99f5f55cf7cdb3a70998c57061b7e1386a9b0

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP on QuickSwap](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ece9b3e0-d7c9-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)

## Summary

Allocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap; wherein, MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.


## Abstract

Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth. ICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.


## Motivation

Decentral Games ICE Poker is the first free play-and earn poker game launched in Decentraland in October 2021 that accounts for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users. If you hop into Decentraland and view the top scenes, you will be directed to an ICE Poker venue where you can play and interact with thousands of other real people, a social experience that no other open metaverse platform has been able to deliver.

ICE Poker has onboarded and will continue to onboard users into Decentraland and the Decentraland wearables ecosystem by delivering direct utility through self-custody and delegation of Decentraland wearables. After creating a Decentraland avatar and purchasing a wearable to play ICE Poker, many players explore other scenes and invest in adjacent Decentraland projects, as well as create their own inspired by ICE Poker.

In addition to ICE Poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more.

The stats today:

*   12 live Decentraland venues
*   1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND
*   8,000+ daily active players
*   203,000+ monthly visitors across all venues (April 2022)


## Specification

Allocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.

### Details:

*   Within 10 days following the final binding proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the ICE-USDC LP.
*   MANA will be distributed by smart contract, available claim in proportion to the amount of LP staked and the amount of time that LP is staked.
*   0 MANA will be earned/retained by the DG DAO Treasury and DG Team. Specifically, the DG DAO will not stake the LP it provides to the pool, so all rewards will go to community members staking LP tokens.


## Conclusion

Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation.

**This proposed MANA allocation is not a grant for the Decentral Games team** – its entire purpose is to maintain daily active and concurrent users within the Decentraland and Decentral Games ecosystems as the Decentral Games team completes development and launches ICE Poker SNG. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth.

ICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.

Since the Stage 1 proposal was posted, it’s been inspiring to see all the stories of Decentraland creators’ events being well-attended by the ICE Poker community, the ICE Poker community investing in other wearable creators/games, and even cases where folks who found Decentraland via DG have since started their own venues, projects, and games in Decentraland. This initiative would welcome ICE Poker players (folks who use Decentraland every day), wearable owners, and the Decentraland community at large to provide this LP, earn MANA, and further participate in the Decentraland DAO.

**Why should the Decentraland DAO itself fund these rewards?**

The Decentraland DAO has assigned $200mm in MANA to their Ecosystem Fund to fund development of engaging content in Decentraland. ICE Poker has already proven its ability to deliver value to Decentraland by driving the majority of Decentraland’s daily active and concurrent user growth in 2022. The majority of the Decentral Games treasury is locked in illiquid Decentraland LAND, LP for DG and ICE, and a Polygon Validator node.

**Why $1mm and why 3 months?**

$1mm USD in MANA would provide sufficient rewards over a 3 month period to allow the Decentral Games team to deliver on building, launching, and growing ICE Poker SNG, which will enable the ecosystem to self-sustain following the ending of the rewards.

**From a proposal execution perspective, why should DG distribute the MANA rewards?**

The DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP on decentral.games, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution. To reiterate, the DG Treasury and Decentral Games will earn 0 MANA. The rewards will go entirely to the community.

**A note from the DG Project Lead and Founder, Miles Anthony:**

""We’ve had conviction around Decentraland and its role in delivering an interactive 3D frontend for the open metaverse from its inception in 2017. Since then, we’ve purchased 1000+ parcels of LAND and invested millions of dollars to build engaging content to attract and retain over 60% of the platform’s users. This MANA allocation is a stepping stone to assist in stabilizing our in-game economy as we prepare to launch ICE Poker Sit-n-Go tournaments, along with other key initiatives that drive organic demand and utility for ICE and solidify our ecosystem’s long term sustainability. With the support of the Decentraland team and community, we look forward to onboarding the next million users into Decentraland and the nascent metaverse.""

For those that have minted a Decentraland Name, I believe that the name plate in Decentraland should be more visible than the non-minted names.  If we make the text a different color such as yellow and make the name plate and text slightly larger, it would make the minted names stand out more from the non-minted generic names.

Many of us have invested MANA into minting names and I believe that this would help to showcase our NFT Decentraland Names.

With the introduction of the new DAO powered by Snapshot, there is a feature within the snapshot platform that allows for voter power (VP) delegation within the defined strategy for the VP calculation. Implementing this feature would allow any player to delegate VP to another player by visiting the following link and entering another player's address and the space: snapshot.dcl.eth

https://snapshot.org/#/delegate

Why would you want to delegate voting power to another player?

There are a few reasons a player may want to delegate VP. Many players I have spoken with tend to store their parcels in a separate address, typically a cold wallet, that lends operator rights to their playable (hot) address. This proposal is an effort to preserve the security of those assets while being able to exercise the voting power they represent.

A second reason arises from the notion of proxying your vote. Not all players or asset holders will participate in proposal review and voting, especially as the number of proposals to the DOA grows. This proposal allows passive investors to exercise their VP by delegating it to players who have a shared vision for the future of Decentraland.

### Description

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, Mitch Todd (<https://mitchtodd.com/>), digital designer and independent wearable creator was nominated:

<https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=item&section=wearables&isMap=false&isFullscreen=false&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=recently_listed&onlyOnSale=true&search=michi+todd&viewAsGuest=false&onlySmart=false>

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.  This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

## Motivation

In Polygonal Mind and CryptoAvatars we believe in interoperability across worlds, and our goal is to make it happen.

The User collection was original created to get people into the metaverse by giving them a 3D avatar. This avatar collection was meant to be a gift to all  NFT.NYC 2021 attendees, but only 500 of them were claimed so far.

We decided to mint all the remaining avatars and provide them as rewards in the upcoming event of MegaCube 2, so we’ll have aover 4000 avatars to give away to Decentraland community.

This collection is fully ready to get integrated and the API too.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

DAPPCRAFT has been working with major brands on doing buildings and events and figuring out the problem. There is no clear path for brands to engage a fragmented metaverse audience. Even once a brand gains a metaverse presence, it's hard to engage users in a fun, gamified experience.

We created a solution, gameplay to direct players to brand locations in Decentraland with smart-wearable technology. We incentivize players by giving tokens, in-game NFTs, and 3rd party NFT rewards for spending time exploring the brand’s virtual locations.

This is the way for everyone coming to Decentraland to have a good experience discovering new amazing places.

## Description

DAPPCRAFT is the company behind the CROSSVERSE.

CROSSVERSE is part of the play2earn incubation program from Decentraland for the past 5 months. We are asking for a grant to execute Phase II of the project.

### Meet Hyp-0

A cute digital pet that helps players to explore the metaverse and have fun!

Recently Decentraland announced a new game asset – “smart wearable”. Hyp-0 is a creation of DAPPCRAFT's 5 months of deep research & development of this technology's capabilities.

We are convinced that he will inspire many other teams to create new unique experiences, like the one we do in CROSSVERSE.

![Hyp-0](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E-Yo5miolqhC-oSU8HTLjf8bb3uVg0LXIyLm4CPY3e8mtEmMlMb3rMUNhXmALYSY-Bc=w2400)

Hyp-0 takes different forms:

*   Idle: Waits for commands from the player
*   Navigate: Shows the direction to brand locations for the player in Decentraland
*   Portal: Show the portal to the player which teleports close to brand locations
*   Claim: The player charging highlighted zone and engaging with brand metaverse location. After the job is done player claims rewards in tokens and NFTs.

![Forms](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ETdquNCGuqv0G-oLx3TCg1DuAgFnuNjHORoOLpUufIL7Od3QGm48BWbFn1TgA9ncXpo=w2400)

### Game loop

**Marketing platform**

Brands buy visits in locations to promote their business in Metaverse. This distributes tasks to the players to visit locations.

**Search**

A player harvesting locations with Hyp-0. Gets rewards in XVRS token in-game NFTs and brand-specific NFTs as rewards

**Laboratory**

A portal to upgrade Hyp-0 and boosts productivity by spending XVRS and in-game NFTs

**Marketplace**

Marketplace to trade in-game NFTs and Hyp-0's

![Hyp-0-1](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XJySApAPlRVFTxBoaiZbOIFdS32wxQ2t_eu5786z57DzOeANmYvZIOQAMV5Knuqj_kg=w2400)

### Phase I

Progress over the last 6 months:

*   Hyp-0 game concept
*   Created 2d and 3d forms for all states
*   Basic animations for a smart wearable
*   Backend server architecture
*   APIs for Decentraland Hyp-0 gameplay
*   Front-end for Decentraland Hyp-0 gameplay with 4 modes and transitions
*   Smart contracts for XVRS token, Rewards, Hyp-0 NFT

![Hyp-0-2](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EXd27p3gnVTuunPxxhYq9x_H4IT2wujBFQ--3N67F8DLGbMaQWLiB41EE5Oei-\_deGM=w2400)

### Use Cases

We are excited to announce that CROSSVERSE partnered with [TrustSwap](https://trustswap.com/) company to bring users to the [HQ in Decentraland](https://youtu.be/-Nt3nmKG1VA?t=393) with Hyp-0 gameplay and incentivize with NFTs.

More use cases are in the negotiation process.

## Specification

Hyp-0 is a digital pet (smart-wearable) NFT that enables gameplay in Decentraland.

**Laboratory**

A place to upgrade your Hyp-0s.

![Variants](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xwVoNQJUc93\_NA38TOwfEf-\_PaFGXCkbErD-cIGW-ml_gqiMABTDmXOoqK32Y1QlGL8=w2400)

**4 RARITY TYPES: Common, Legendary, Epic, Mythic**

Every player starts with a common type. Players can upgrade the rarity level.
Requires: XVRS token + NFTs

**4 PROPERTIES TO UPGRADE: Navigation, Charging, Storage, Release**

Properties can be downgraded to basic levels if Hyp-0 is not active.
Requires: XVRS token + NFTs

![Upgrades](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nCCbMUy5DlwnuqmVAfJ7qn4zFBg4LPIqlaFfvdb9178C69KhbTnEaEyjeQawArLBHto=w2400)

The next generation after Mythic enables a secret PvP gameplay.

### Future plans. Long-term vision.

The gameplay continues forward and is not limited to Hyp-0. The players will be collecting NFTs which can be used to craft modules and robots. Here is the illustration of technology we developed in DAPPCRAFT which solves the scalability issue.

Here is the demo video - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwHoA1eLMKw>

### For land owners

Hyp-0 gameplay brings players to Decentraland locations. This generates traffic and eventually increases the land value.

We are looking for partners who can participate in the alpha launch in the next two months. Please contact me via email: johnny.k@dapp-craft.com if you are interested.

We can see CROSSVERSE as a successful business and an important part of metaverse development. Our business model is dependent on Decentraland success and it will take time to build a positive cash flow. For now, we have to rely on grants and investments. Its been almost a year since DAPPCRAFT started this project and invested a lot of time and resources into it.

Whatever we do our core values are to explore limits and expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Inspire our friends, colleagues, and other industry pioneers.

## Abstract

Exodus: Goodbye World is a metaverse RPG set in Decentraland and being actively developed on a 7x7 estate at 126,44. The core Exodus team, not including volunteers, includes 4 Software Engineers and 4 3D-Desigers working under the leadership of the JTV Development team. We create fun and interactive content to Decentraland so that it can continue growing its player base. The team provides in-game content which has totaled countless playthroughs and thousands of wearable rewards at the JTVHQ venue. As the team builds more interactive content at the Exodus estate, it will need to expand and provide support to its developers. This grant makes a first step towards a much larger goal and ultimately to partner with and give back to Decentraland.

## Description

Exodus is a metaverse role-playing game built by childhood friends who met online playing MMORPGs. Every day, MMORPGs bring together millions of people who form strong bonds, communities, and entire economies. Out of a shared passion with cryptocurrencies and MMORPGs, Exodus was born with the goal of making these communities and economies into real, consensus driven assets.

The name Exodus symbolizes a journey away from the online games we played and cherished as children and towards a new era where crypto assets allow gamers to create real value out of their playtime. We believe that time spent gaming is valuable and want Exodus to realize that belief. Exodus is themed around the concept of moving on from old ways of life and towards a better and more prosperous future. The character will begin in the medieval period and discover new resources, materials, tools, creatures, and questlines. Players will be able to play either passively or actively and work towards special items which will be represented as on-chain assets. The ultimate vision of Exodus is to have a full-fledged blockchain economy capable of providing opportunities to players of all types.

The JTV team has always focused on educational outreach when onboarding new users. As such, it has grown out of a mutual love for learning and having fun at the same time. The team has volunteered countless hours towards providing Decentraland content and will continue to grow to expand this outreach. JTV embodies this vision and has become a true goodwill of the Decentraland space. With Exodus, the JTV Development team aims to bring thousands of people to Decentraland to have engaging metaverse experiences.


## Specification

Team & Experience:

JTV Development is led by none other than JTV, a prominent Decentraland streamer and influencer. JTV streams multiple times a week to onboard new users and share his metaverse experience. Through his promotions and community events, he has distributed tens of thousands of wearables and provided a ‘first wearable’ to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people. JTV has inspired many Decentraland content creators through his goodwill and general want to better himself and his community. In the opinion of the grant writer (not JTV) – JTV deserves the entirety of this grant, though his intention is to support his team and community through the massive task of building Exodus.

The JTV Engineers include 3 professional software engineers, 1 software intern, and 4 professional designers/artists. This group provides experience in blockchain development, backend engineering, front-end user experience, 3D designs/animations, web-design, and story-writing. If there was a team with the dedication to achieve the vision of Exodus, this is that team. In fact, the team has already volunteered their time towards creating engaging content like the popular JTV Easter egg hunt and scavenger hunts. Despite this grant’s pending status, the team has eagerly begun full-stack development of Exodus.

As the Exodus project grows, the JTV team intends to provide new metaverse opportunities to design and software interns. We believe that this fits well with the teams focus on educational content and its theme of giving back to the community. This fits well with the mission of Decentraland to empower its players and to provide opportunities to those who seek them.

The JTV Development team consists of 4 Engineers, 4 Designers and various volunteers. We intend to add multiple interns (at least 5 interns split between Engineering and Design) to add to this team.

Allocation of Funds:

Funding will be divided into Engineering, Design, Marketing, and miscellaneous expenses like music, story writing, and server upkeep. Please understand, these values are approximate and may change depending on need. Engineering and design will include funds purposed towards hiring interns. The funding will be divided approximately into the following amounts:

Engineering - $125,000

Design – $75,000

Marketing - $25,000

Miscellaneous - $15,000


## Roadmap and milestones

The primary release of Exodus will occur over a 6-month period with 3 phases: pre-beta, public-beta, and public release. The pre-beta phase will consist of a gradual release of gathering and crafting activities (woodchopping, fishing, mining, forging, cooking, scavenging), quests, and monster-hunting activities. Once fully rolled out, Exodus will transition into a public-beta purposed towards testing the game and preparing for public launch. Exodus intends to officially launch in January 2023.

We emphasize, the true roadmap of Exodus extends much further than the 6-month period of this grant. Our team intends to deliver a return of value to Decentraland for the long-term future. After public release, Exodus will continue to focus on attracting new players to Decentraland and building fresh content. Blockchain integration like wearables will be key features of Exodus, and will be continually developed for the game.

We believe that all grant recipients should strive to return the value of their grant plus some. As such, Exodus intends to contribute 5% of all revenue back to the DAO up to a total value of 300,000 USD. This is a small amount to offer in return for the critical support that the DAO would be providing with this grant and the team intends to deliver this. If successful, not only will this provide a return on the investment that the DAO makes with the grant, but it will also attract thousands of new players to Decentraland who can consume other metaverse content.

## Abstract

We have a Twitter page where we post daily videos about upcoming events in Decentraland. The main purpose of this page is to make easier for the everyday user to know more about the current events of the day, with informative short videos about the events details and artist's background (if any performing). Think of it as the live events list, but with subtitled videos explaining them.

## Description

One thing we noticed is that somedays it can get hard to keep track of events! Our goal is to make the event page more digestable for the average user, by visually explaining the activities of the day. We have been providing daily videos since april.

> We have listened to the community feedback and we made a few quality updates on our editing. *No more AI voices, changed to a high quality audio, implemented video covers, switched to a new intro and much more!*

**Twitter page: https://twitter.com/DclHighlights**


## Specification

Funding from the DAO will allow DCL Highlights to continue providing daily event videos to our Decentraland communities for the next year. We also plan to create at least 10x monthly videos aimed to bring more visibility to newly approved DAO-granted projects *(this was a suggestion from the DAO Grant Support Squad on a video call we had).*

Producing daily videos requires time and dedication, and creating them is crucial for the promotion of new events, musicians, artists, and DJs. The long-term application suggestion was also from a known community member in our last proposal.

Fund Allocation for 1 year:
Assistant Voice Actress for Translated Videos: $6000 Marketing: $12,000
Salary: $40,320 (approx. $20/hour,  6h/day everyday, at 42 hours/week)

The average video editor salary in US is $48,750 per year or $25 per hour. (Source: salary.com)


## Personnel

My name is Vapo and I create videos by myself. I've been working fulltime in metaverse-related content since december 2021, contributing with videos and advertisement in different projects. (https://twitter.com/0xVapo)

Our goal is to become a steady source of video news about Decentraland events. We want a long-term commitment with the community to continue creating relevant content everyday to bring new users and keep current players updated as much as possible!


## Roadmap and milestones

**Create DAILY event videos for the Decentraland community  for the next year.**

Translate daily videos to brazilian portuguese with a female voice.

Currently, the internal product tagging system does not work properly for finding wearables by artist name.

Personally, I've added my name to most of my wearable titles as a workaround.

Should there be an additional search function for searching wearables by creator name?

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Manage Bounty program for vulnerability reports](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=09aad6c0-0471-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)

## Summary

Request the DAO to cover the payment of the rewards and grant the Decentraland Foundation to manage them as the proposal state.


## Abstract

As the DAO owns the smart contracts and manages the development of the protocol, we are requesting to cover the rewards needed for every vulnerability found in the Decentraland bounty program. The Decentraland foundation is committed to triage, answering, and fixing every disclosure received. Every payment will be published publicly.


## Motivation

Bug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to discover and disclose potential vulnerabilities in projects’ smart contracts and applications, thereby protecting projects and their users. For their good work, security researchers receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability, as determined by the project affected.

Why have a bug bounty program at all? In 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Web3 community over $238m, and bug bounties can prevent those hacks from happening. Bug bounty programs surface vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before they get exploited in malicious hacks that destroy projects and ruin reputations.


## Specification

As members of the Security Advisory Board (SAB), we hereby request the DAO to approve and fund the bounty program and due to its nature and limited execution capabilities, delegate to the Decentraland Foundation the ability to respond to any vulnerability disclosed through the program. That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to doing the triage and answering the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed. So basically when a payment has to happen due to a valid report under the program, the Decentraland Foundation will inform DAO with case #, the recipient wallet address, and the amount to be paid and also, shall contact the SAB in order to fix the vulnerabilities disclosed.

The program is composed of different threat levels and topics:

**Smart Contracts**

High					       **Up to USD 500 000**

Medium			                **Up to USD 20 000**

Low					        **USD 1 000**

**Websites and Applications**

Critical				       **USD 18 000**

High				               **USD 6 000**

Medium				       **USD 3 000**

Low					       **USD 1 000**

Payouts are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **MANA and USDT**, with a minimum of 20% to be done in USDT.

The program is not tied or attached to any third party but the Decentraland Foundation will use them and their expertise and platforms to help administrate the program. Therefore and after a deep initial analysis, the SAB has selected and recommended the Decentraland Foundation to start the bounty program using [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/).

The Decentraland bounty program can be found [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/decentraland/).

The DAO will publish each payment made for every reward.


## Impacts

Decentraland will continue working on its security by encouraging white hackers to participate in the bounty program.


## Implementation Pathways

For transparency, the Decentraland Foundation will provide a report about the vulnerabilities accepted including the disclosure date, description, and fixed date.


## Conclusion

The idea is to keep Decentraland safe and secure for every user. The DAO will provide the funds while the Foundation will manage the disclosures accordingly

Hello, my name is Johnny and I am the developer of the TV series Sounds of the Underground. SOTU airs nationally on 5 CBS stations, and YouTube, and in the past has been featured on AmazonPrime, Rakuten, Samsung TV+, and Vizeo WatchFree. Being a part of the DCL community myself, I am looking to partner with the DAO to feature Decentraland on the show and build our community.

Decentraland would receive the following:

*   A 20-second promotional video aired within all 5 episodes this season.
*   Category exclusivity (no other metaverse will be featured)

## Description

Sounds of the Underground should receive funding as it will solve a large need - more people joining the DCL community. With the flood of new metaverses being built, Decentraland needs to be the one that stands out among the rest. Having DCL featured in such prominent places will drive more people to the platform, and build more recognition and notoriety for the platform. The series will be airing around the time of the Decentraland Music Festival so it is the perfect time to draw people in.

Quick Stats:

*   Combined CBS network viewership of over 1.5 million
*   Combined CBS OTT advertising impressions - 525,000
*   Exposure of 40+ artists, both established and up-and-coming
*   Over 15 brands promoted
*   3 Mental Health nonprofits supported
*   Continuous write-ups in over 20 media outlets
*   Full public relations and marketing team

The episodes will also air within Decentraland at one of the many great venues I've worked with before.


## Specification

The project is being filmed on July 13th and 14th. After filming we will enter the editing and post-production phases. Promotions will begin on traditional media outlets, TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook in September, and the series will air in October.

Please view our full proposal doc here: https://bit.ly/3zaEi2v

Over the next 6 months, Decentraland will be the primary metaverse we focus on and build in for ETHDenver, EFDevconnect, Sonic Bloom, and other high impact opportunities. Our goal in decentraland is to recreate the main conference building, the Sports Castle, at ETHDenver 2022, highlight, and showcase 100 + featured artists at the official ETHDenver Art Gallery and Auction. Artists can choose a commission from 0 - 100%, with their designated commission going to a beneficiary. This year the commission will go to Gitcoin; to benefit Art focused Public Goods.

Our two calls for artists can be found here:
irlunderground.com/eth-denver-gallery
irlunderground.com/gitcoin

This year's panel of curators of the gallery have diverse backgrounds, spanning multiple creative initiatives around art and technology. Annie Phillips, of IRL Art, Robert Gray of IRL Art, Shivani Mitra of Museum of Crypto Art, and Jessica Angel of Art Project Decentralized.

We will work with our collaborators in the NEAR Ecosytem, who created our video last year, to have a video made of the gallery to post on social media.

Last years video: https://www.instagram.com/p/CK7B-w4n4Gb/

We will share the video directly with all of the approximately 100 participating artists and facilitators to promote decentraland, the auction, the artists, and ETHDenver.

Additionally, we will livestream builds, interview participating builders, and share those through DCL Reports and Boombox Heads twitch streams. Our inhouse video team will additionally make periodic recaps of our progress and builds.

In the ETHDenver gallery, we will have decentraland vinyl and printed graphics on a display around a large TV that will host the video with a QR code to visit the parcels. We will provide (2) VR headsets to conference attendees to experience the gallery physically and virtually within Decentraland. The conference will have over 5000 attendees physically, and thousands more can tune in virtually through GamerJibe and our potential Decentraland Gallery.

We currently don't own any parcels of land in any metaverse. This would be our first ability to integrate and explore more features, like adding contributors, and creating wearables, which is only accessible to land owners. It will allow us more long term ability to add new contributors, provide educational, hands-on opportunities for more creators in our collective to learn and engage with Decentraland.


## Specification

We will complete this project internally with the 7 team members, our larger network of collaborators and partners, and the additional 8 granted collaborators.

## Grant size

52,200 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x3026e5dca7A3F50a482d5f06Fb18CE607386531b

## Description

I Think the idea of being able to represent your country within Decentraland would be amazing, There are 195 countrie flags that will need to be textured onto individual flags, the item will be a common. Being so many flag getting 19500 mana for all the variations is hard. So i decided to bring this idea to the DAO.
Having flags would also be a step forward to DCL olympics or incorperating the IRL olympics.

Could even do flags for different communites, events, people etc. So many possibilites.


## Specification

1 x Flag base mode
1x texture of each country total of 195 countries
I will be using blender to create the model and photoshop to create the texture.
common item

15297,15297,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should scenes be able to block users inside them?,"> by 0xcf10cd8b5dc2323b1eb6de6164647756bad4de4d (Eibriel)

Following on my 2 previous proposals to improve the [moderation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f68cd110-3e8c-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) and [safety](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3b2b86c0-3e8a-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) tools on Decentraland.

This one improves on the previous ones by allowing the owners of a land to fully control the moderation of their own scenes, without affecting other scenes.

When developing a scene with the SDK a new new element can be added to `requiredPermissions` on `scene.json`: `ALLOW_TO_BLOCK_USERS_INSIDE_SCENE`.

The developer can call to `blockUser()`
With the following parameters

    setUserBlockStatus( 
         ""0x000...."",
        {
            chat: true,
            voice: true,
            avatar_sounds: true
        }
    )

That call will instruct the Client to block (or unblock) an user while the player's avatar is inside the scene, for the duration of the current session. A notification could be shown to the player to let them know about the change.

This will allow for the following:

*   PlayerA enters the scene
*   PlayerB enters the scene and starts harassing other players via voice
*   A moderator sets `voice: false` on a server for PlayerB
*   Since PlayerA's scene has the necessary logic to connect to that server it receives the change, and executes `setUserBlockStatus` with PlayerB's address and `voice: false` as parameters
*   If PlayerB exits the scene PlayerA still can't hear PlayerB
*   If PlayerA also exits the scene PlayerA can now hear PlayerB

All the logic on who should be blocked is handled exclusively in the scene's code (with the aid of an optional authoritative server), without any involvement of the Catalysts.

I think it is necessary to do a monthly check of the MANA value to align it with the 500$
mentioned in the documentation.
As the mana price needed for publication hasn't reflected for a long time the value of 500$ it would be nice to align it the first of every month.

15299,15299,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Keep Polygon transactions free,"> by 0xa87d168717538e86d71ac48baccaeb84162de602 (cryptonico#e602)

### Abstract

This is a follow-up from this [past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7af34c90-5d1e-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7), where a Grant was given by the DAO to keep Polygon transactions in Decentraland free for all its users. Free transactions mean that Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction they perform (in Polygon) while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera.

Decentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021. Biconomy works by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**

### Solution

Up until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth.

It’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp.

The Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and keep the flywheel spinning: better UX > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.

If this proposal closes and the result is ""YES"", it will be promoted to a Draft proposing the DAO Committee to be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.

- Yes: Authorize the DAO Committee to continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank
- No: Do not continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank

## Description

Decentraland (DCL) allows for an immense amount of personal creativity and freedom.  DCL creates the opportunity to engage with others in novel ways in an expansive virtual space; be that by attending concerts and galleries, or playing games.  We seek to expand on the gaming options within DCL by building Exodus: Goodbye World!

We feel that having a large-scale, frequently updated game within the DCL platform will provide years of entertainment and financial value to the community.  It will help drive increased user traffic into DCL and to the overall DCL gaming scene.
Exodus aims to be massive, immersive, and create an engaging player experience.  Initially set in a medieval era, players will be able to train their skills, gather a variety of resources, craft tools & equipment, and even earn NFTs through gameplay.  As we approach and overcome the challenges of hosting a huge variety of items on-chain, we will eventually bridge in-game resources to public blockchain(s).  This will help create a player driven Play-and-Earn economy where players can truly own the results of their hard in-game work.
In developing Exodus, we have a heavy focus on educational outreach.  We are providing opportunities for interns and community members who want to be part of our journey. Whether the focus is design or software development, our team environment is supportive of those who want to learn and contribute to the project.


## Specification

Exodus has already started its Closed Beta. Throughout the beta we will be creating and adding portions of the game on a regular schedule. Before launching the beta we worked passionately on the front-end and back-end infrastructure to ensure the basic gaming mechanics were enabled. This included the Inventory interface, Banking functionality, Daily challenges, Leveling system, Beta Currency, and first gaming objective - Woodchopping.  We also created the scenery and over 100 assets for use in the game.

The Closed Beta of Exodus went live on June 20th, 2022 at coordinates 126,44.  In the three weeks since, we have created and enabled an in-game Merchandise interface, rolled out Scavenger Hunting, and nearly completed preparations for the next gaming objective - Fishing.  Future releases will involve other skills and activities, including Workshopping, Mining, Forging, Cooking, and Hunting.  During beta, we will be writing an in-depth storyline so that Questing activities can be included post-beta.

We plan to continue to release major updates on a monthly basis, as permitted, until the full game completion by the end of the closed Beta.  We aim to deliver minor bug fixes, quality of life updates, and patches on a weekly to biweekly basis.
Please view our video that walks you through the beginning stages of our game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6trfYpRivP0
After the closed Beta period, Exodus will have an OPEN Beta to further stress test the game’s infrastructure and prepare for public release.

We use a variety of technologies for software development, design, server maintenance, and project organization.  This includes, but is not limited to: AWS, Discord, Github, Blender, the Adobe Suite, and Visual Studio.

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Create a task force to follow up with grant beneficiaries and support their progress. The goal of the project is to guarantee the effectiveness of the Grants Program, holding grantees accountable for their projects, and signaling to the DAO if a vesting contract needs to be revoked.


## Grant size

84,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x658497d7681e4Fb18C65AbD5Ce066A1e3082c1e5

## Description

The  [Community Grants](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/community-grants/)  Program is one of the most important vehicles the DAO has to accomplish its vision of supporting and facilitating the sustainable growth of the Decentraland platform.

In the past year, the DAO awarded more than  [$3.5M USD to 58 community led projects](https://governance.decentraland.org/?type=grant\&status=enacted)  working in different areas such as content creation, developer tools, research, events, game development, among others.

Up to this moment, grant’s beneficiaries update their progress voluntarily using different platforms, such as the DAO’s Discord server, the forum thread of the grant proposal and sometimes presenting their process during the monthly town-halls. **However not every project has informed their progress, nor shipped a final result. This is an issue the DAO should invest energy to address.** The return of impact of our grants is a key asset to build a better platform, **and it is our responsibility to support their development.**

Most of the grants are given through a revocable vesting contract, in other words, **the DAO can revoke the contract and recover the unvested funds if the beneficiary fails to deliver what was promised. However this mechanism has not been used yet, we can argue it’s because of the DAO’s weak oversight capabilities or missing incentives to do so.**

This proposal is to build a team of experienced producers/project managers to build relationships with grant beneficiaries, hold regular meetings with them to track their progress and, in the case a team fails to deliver, escalate the issue to the DAO to revoke their contract.


## Specification

This grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds its objectives.

The proposed DAO Grant Support Squad will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the  [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) . This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.

The grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet. The key holders are Pablo Lewin, Yemel Jardi and Manuel Araoz in their respective capacity as Squad Member, DAO Committee Member and Trusted Community Member.


## Personnel

The proposed team of the Grant Support Squad is the following:

*   Advisor - Gia Castello ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gia-castello-9294b238) )
*   Sr. Producer - Pablo Lewin ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewinpablo) )
*   Ssr. Producer - Juan Pablo Cassinelli ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-cassinelli) )

The team will count with a Board of Experts providing technical knowledge about different areas such as: wearable making, scene development, software engineering, product design and marketing.

Total Hours: ~230 monthly hours or ~55 weekly hours.\
Budget: 14,000 USD per month or a total of 84,000 USD

This includes:

*   Team compensation: $61,800 USD
*   Board of Experts compensation: $7,200 USD
*   Operational expenses: $3,000
*   Travel and accommodation expenses for 1 event: $12,000 USD.


## Roadmap and milestones

Initially, the team will focus on the following 3 points:

*   Diagnose: Initial contact with current grant beneficiaries and evaluation of results.
*   Support: Recurrent follow-up and set up of advisory calls.
*   Process Definition: Document the process to onboard and support grants.

These guidelines can be broken down into actionable steps like:

*   Team set-up and diagnostic tool creation
*   Interview all beneficiaries of +58 grants.
*   Recurrent follow-up with active grants (frequency based on project size).
*   Build an advisory team of different areas of expertise.
*   Set up advisory meetings with grantees.
*   Documentation of the process, draw conclusions and develop future roadmap.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Following the success of MetaParty hosting the Community Fashion Show at metaverse Fashion Week, our team is committed to helping Decentraland grow. After a series of meetings and planning sessions, we’ve decided the best way to help the community is to engage with new players by making Genesis Plaza a more friendly, interactive, and supportive environment. This will include tours, interactive lessons and welcome events for beginners.

We’ve created a slide deck presentation to demonstrate our proposal, which can be viewed with the link below:

https://bit.ly/37EfFkX


## Grant size

60,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xdd03f9B8bf0813AD4a5681a4A06A0D85f4169B84

## Description

We believe that Genesis Plaza is an excellent starting point for new Decentraland players. But new players typically spawn into the metaverse with little clue about the true potential of this platform. Genesis Plaza provides players with numerous options to get involved in Decentraland, yet many remain confused or simply dormant. There needs to be a better and more consistent way to educate players about what’s possible in Decentraland and get them interacting with each other.

MetaParty wants to take full advantage of Genesis Plaza by hosting welcome events, tours, and informative lessons in the numerous spaces available. Our team is experienced hosting fun and lively events, such as MetaVerse Fashion Week, that draw players of all experience levels into the metaverse. Our grant proposal would allow MetaParty to host regular events in Genesis Plaza that encourage players to explore Decentraland, learn about its features, and have fun interactions with other players.

To accomplish our goal, MetaParty will hire a series of tour guides in multiple languages to assist new players in Decentraland. This process will include accountability measures in which the community can track our progress via a sign-in sheet. MetaParty will train, oversee, and manage these tour guides to ensure quality experiences for new players.

We’ve created a YouTube video describing the proposal that shows a demo tour, which can be viewed at the link below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyY8XqKaDg


## Specification

We’re proposing the following:

MetaParty staff members are present at Genesis Plaza five days a week Monday through Friday during 12pm UTC to 4pm UTC to give tours, host fun events, and teach new users about Decentraland. Our staff will use a combination of voice and text features to alert new users to join the tour.

The tour will take place once per hour from 12pm UTC to 4pm UTC and last about 20 minutes, taking new players through the main buildings in Genesis Plaza (outlined below) and use each location to speak about different aspects of Decentraland: NFTs, wearables, land, wearable design and more.

Lessons will take place once per shift at 2pm UTC at different venues throughout Genesis Plaza and cover the following: Introduction to Builder, Introduction to Wearable Creation and Introduction to Social Media, Branding and Marketing for Decentraland.

Tour outline:

Note: While some buildings in Genesis Plaza are explicitly named, others are unnamed. For the purposes of our tour, we’ve named buildings that lack a name. For a visual representation of each tour stop, please see our video proposal linked above.

Additionally, we recognize the importance of having tours conducted in multiple languages to reach the worldwide audience coming into Decentraland. Proceeds from the grant will go towards hiring Spanish language tour guides and additional language speakers.

Main Building (0,0) - Quick overview of Decentraland basics; how to run, walk, emote, access backpack and view the main map. Tour guide will talk about Genesis Plaza and proceed to the first tour stop.

Long Building (2,7) - Introduction to how Decentraland runs on MANA, land ownership and the DAO.

Auditorium (7,6) - Introduction to events in Decentraland and discussion on how someone can build a career in the metaverse as a creator, or become established within Decentraland communities.

Circle Building (7,-1) - Discuss how to buy wearables, brief discussion on what kinds of wearables are available and how to use the Decentraland Marketplace. In addition we will briefly cover smart wearables.

Trade Center (6,-7) - Discuss MANA as an asset that can be bought and traded. At this point in the tour we will briefly cover how to set up a MetaMask wallet, and provide links in game to Decentraland content creators videos that go into further detail about MetaMask.

NFT Hallway (-1,-4) - Introduction to NFTs and discussion on the different forms they take in Decentraland.

Social Building (-2,-9) - Talk about Decentraland social media channels like Twitter and Discord. Briefly discuss the Builder and how it can be used via a link in this area. Furthermore, we will cover Decentraland content creators.

Rose Building (-7,7) - The final tour stop will be used to discuss communities in Decentraland that host events and other fun interactive experiences. We will introduce players to the Decentraland Events page. Tour ends with a question and answer portion.

Mega-Party - At the end of each month, new users will be invited to a Mega-Party hosted by MetaParty in Genesis Plaza at the auditorium. This party will take place on the last friday of each month at 8pm UTC. It will feature performances from DJs like DJTrax and other performers associated with MetaParty. Special guests from the community will be invited for talks.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

We believe Decentraland player usage data should be collected by the DAO and made available to all Decentraland users.

User location data is currently available through use of the /islands endpoint on DCL content server nodes. This information can be collected periodically (e.g. every few seconds) and stored in a database to be served up via API queries available to the Decentraland community. It is not feasible for multiple parties to independently collect this information as it would cause undue strain on Decentraland infrastructure.

This data should be collected and owned by the DAO, and therefore be owned by Decentraland’s users and not a private company or individual.

## Description

**Why collect this data and make it available?**

As Atlas CORP has been in the analytics business for 18 months, we know that there are some immediate benefits that could be recognized by the Decentraland community through the creation of this service:

**1. 	Grow the number of successful Decentraland Builders**

Move the conversation from “why Decentraland?” to “why your use case?” for builders looking to win clients or raise funds.

Providing high level Decentraland statistics will increase the growth and success of builders. Often the first question asked of teams looking to build or sell in Decentraland focuses on the metaverse itself and not the team’s use case; although Decentraland is the most decentralized metaverse it still exists in a competitive landscape. Investors and clients often need to justify investment or choice of metaverse before they can start to focus on a team’s specific use case.

By providing data on Daily Active Users, Total User Growth of Decentraland, and traffic by parcel, builders can refer to these open source analytics instead of each team attempting to obtain them by themselves.

**2. 	Prevent undue load on Decentraland Infrastructure**

While the data in question is public, everyone cannot query this data for themselves without an adverse impact on Decentraland nodes.

There has already been discussion in the forums about shutting down external access to player position data due to increased loads felt by Decentraland content server nodes. Too many concurrent requests to these endpoints would have the effect of a DDoS attack which could impact the quality of the service each node can provide.

Therefore instead of a) playing out the Tragedy of the Commons that would occur if everyone collected the data for themselves, b) removing access such that nobody can benefit from this data, or c) allowing the data to be acquired by the highest bidder/private entity – we believe the ecosystem will benefit most from the data collection being done once and everyone sharing in access to that data.

**3. 	Prevent Private Monopolization of the Data**

We at Atlas CORP have first-hand knowledge of how valuable this data can be to those operating in Decentraland. User position data can be used to determine how many users attended events – critical for event hosts to understand how well their event performed. Daily active user data is crucial to those seeking to invest in the metaverse to help understand returns on investment.

We believe that no private institution should be able to gate-keep this information from the rest of the community. We at Atlas CORP used to make this information freely available using our own private hosting infrastructure, but we outpaced our capacity requiring a move to more dynamic scaling solutions. This is why we’re here talking about this proposal.

**tl;dr**

The DAO can provide the Decentraland community a free source of user data via API for up to one year for the cost of $57,300. The existence of this data set will help to grow the builder and entrepreneurial community by providing important metrics needed to win clients and funding, and prevent monopolization by private entities. Atlas CORP is the suitable candidate for this development given an extensive history in Decentraland data collection and analytics.


## Specification

**What Data is in Scope?**

This proposal is only for Decentraland user data as reported by the /comms/islands endpoint on Decentraland Content Servers.

This proposal does NOT include:

*   Content Server data (e.g. scene files, user profile history)
*   Scene-specific data (e.g. object clicks and interactions)
*   Any personally identifiable information (PII), excluding ETH wallet address
*   User IRL location data
*   Any derived content from a user’s ETH wallet

Data will be collected from all active, registered Decentraland Content Servers which at the time of writing includes hephaestus, hela, heimdallr, baldr, loki, dg, odin, unicorn, marvel, and athena.

This data set can provide a platform for building more sophisticated reports by the DCL developer community. The DAO could also choose to one day monetize access to this data (e.g. when the data is being used directly for profit), as well as augment what data is collected and made available. It is important to note that this proposal is currently limited in scope to the one data set and free access to the community, and that these next steps may be the subject of future proposals.

**How will this work?**

Data will be collected every 20 seconds and piped into a Mongo Atlas cloud database, with a Digital Ocean server set up to provide API access to queries on the data.

An automated feed will be set up to collect data from an authoritative source of each active DAO node. Collecting data every 20 seconds will result in 3 datapoints a minute; graphs using one-minute granularity will have 3 datapoints on which to aggregate data points per minute. Data collection will be set up redundantly on two or more servers, or on a single load-balanced cluster, to minimize downtime in data collection. This data is expected to grow at 1Gb per day, which may accelerate with the growth of daily active users.

As the data is natively in JSON, we propose to use Mongo Atlas as the cloud database of choice. The database will also be deployed with multiple nodes to minimize downtime. Mongo provides an easy way to scale for future needs – whether through increasing storage capacity or sharding the deployment for increased API and query load.

To minimize infrastructure costs, we propose keeping only 3 months of data available for public consumption. A process will be designed to backup, purge, and post/host historical data such that users can perform historical analysis without excessive cost to the DAO.

An API server will be written to provide simplified API access to the data in the database. These queries may include things like – users per minute (global or per parcel), daily active users (global or per parcel), and unique Decentraland visitors (global or per parcel). The API code can be made open source and hosted on GitLab, but hosted privately on Digital Ocean to prevent unauthorized access to the DAO’s database. Additional access can be granted to additional DAO representatives if deemed appropriate.

API access will remain open, although a throttling mechanism will be put in place per IP address to prevent DDoS of the API servers. In addition, query data (e.g. who’s asking for what) could be saved in the database and made available as APIs for complete transparency.

A dashboard will be made available to show recent Decentraland population data and daily active users for the reportable data set.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Ever have trouble finding the exact wearable you were looking for? Have you ever wanted to save an entire outfit for easier changing? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could search for an item by name, find it, and then wear it?

Take a step inside your Decentraland closet! A more advanced backpack, accessible in an external web application.

## Description

I seek to create a web application that will enable advanced backpack features to simplify and enhance the backpack experience and also reduce the need for backpack features inside of the current clients.  Many of the features proposed by the community can be achieved including outfit saving, sorting and filtering, previewing multiple marketplace wearables at once and more.

Why not create this as an addition to the current backpack?  My main concern when designing this was that any additions to the current backpack would still run into existing issues with the backpack loading slow and not loading in high traffic scenes and at seemingly random times.

The goal of this project is twofold: add additional features but also ease some frustration with the existing backpack reliability. I also like the idea that someone looking to build a new client can potentially leverage the closet app for their backpack functionality instead of building their own and can focus on the core client functionality.  In addition, the majority of the new features require some external service to be built, to save outfits etc., which can be integrated faster and easier into the current backpack after they are built.


## Specification

The project will consist of a single “front-end” web application, created using next.js, and a server application and database to store outfits and any user related content. Additionally, existing decentraland foundation services (lambdas + catalyst apis) are used to fetch avatar and wearable data.

The services will most likely be hosted in AWS, but I will explore other options that can reduce costs so this can be hosted long term.  The final product will have any necessary production-ready features such as data security and encryption, potential use of CDN if loading times are an issue outside of the US, and potentially at least 2 server applications running for failover/redundancy if the need arises.

The first phase of the project will be focused on the main UI/UX features and the second phase includes integration with the catalyst endpoints to sync outfit changes in game.  In addition to the core features, I hope to add social features, such as seeing other people’s closets and being able to try on other’s saved outfits.

The goal is to increase user activity and socialization around wearable collections and stimulate more traffic to the marketplace by providing easy navigation for any items they are seeing.

After completion, the project source code will be made public so everyone can benefit from the catalyst api avatar interactions, in an attempt to create an ecosystem of many clients, as well as examples of interacting with the dcl lambdas and nft apis.

I have hosted an initial version to demonstrate feasibility, explore the data available and show the basic trying on features: [DCL Closet Prototype](https://dcl-closet.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

To use the app, paste in your wallet address under ""Avatar Address"" and your current avatar and backpack will load.  To preview your avatar with someone else's backpack, you can paste a different address into ""Backpack Address""


## Personnel

I am a full stack senior software engineer of over 10 years by profession and have all of the skills required to execute. I have contributed sdk development in several large community events as well as have my own parcel that I actively develop and visit daily. I have 2 publicly available sdk scripts and am always looking for ways to assist other devs and the community.

I am also very familiar with the existing data and apis for interacting with user wearables. For the MVFW Summer Gala I created a wearable viewing feature that allowed users to see what any avatar was currently wearing in a ui menu, with direct links to the marketplace listing.

I also seek to hire someone to create UX wireframes to assist with the outfit saving flows and sorting and filtering functionality as well as a UI designer to make the application feel fully polished visually

### DESCRIPTION

One of the Grant Support Squad’s goals is to guarantee the effectiveness of the Grants Program, holding grantees accountable for their projects, and signaling to the DAO if a vesting contract needs to be revoked.

After 2 months of working closely with Decentraland grantees, our Grant Support Squad has detected some /“practices that raise concerns”/ regarding some of the projects´ health.
When the grantee does not comply with the basic  [terms and conditions](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/receiving-grants/)  of the Grants program, it is defined that the grant must be revoked. However, there are other practices not yet defined in the terms and conditions which have raised concerns. We’d like to open up the discussion and ask the community to make sure we guarantee an efficient use of the community treasury, with your input.

### Some  concerns raised so far include:

*   When it is impossible for us to have real contact with the Grantee during the 30 days after the grant request was approved by the DAO.

*   When the Grantee doesn’t make the official update on the proposal page.

*   When Grantees are reluctant to interact with the community (no discord participation, no updates, no response in any channel of communication).

*   When the use of the budget and the project have inconsistencies.

*   When it’s not clear who is managing the funds.

*   When there’s suspicion of a grantee taking advantage of the intellectual property of a third party.

*   When the project is not making progress or the deliverables don’t match the allocated budget.

*   When fellow community members raise concerns (publicly or privately) of misuse of grant funds or poor ethics.

*   When the project is already getting financial support from the Decentraland Foundation.

*   When the grantee has not released the funds vested after 2 months the vesting contract was enacted.

### POLL: Decide the best procedure to revoke a grant?

*   **Community Decides:**  Present each case with our arguments and recommendations to the Community and ask if the Grant should be revoked.

*   **DAO committee decides:** Present each case with our arguments and recommendations for the DAO Committee to decide if the grant should be revoked.

*   **New committee decides:** Present each case with our arguments and recommendations and assign the responsibility to decide to a NEW Committee which specifically addresses these matters.

*   **Do nothing.**

We’d love to hear your opinion regarding the decision making on these types of concerns. Let us know in the comments and we’d be happy to discuss them in more detail.

- Community decides
- DAO committee decides
- New committee decides
- Do nothing
- Invalid question/options

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

MAD is dedicated to facilitating interaction in the metaverse and maximizing virtual land utilization. MAD provides a decentralized protocol for landowners to monetize their virtual lands: landowners can stake lands to MAD and generate yield through two MAD products: Radical Public Leasing and Advertisement Batched Auction.

Radical Market is a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand. It lowers the bar for people to enter the metaverse.  For the lands that are not leased out in the radical marketplace, MAD builds billboards on top of them with ads placeholders and employs a bundling auction strategy: all land estates are batched together as a single combined bid to achieve maximum exposure.


## Grant size

100,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x2B7F0615979eddDeAF83BFEC23F66fb5a6D177A4

## Description

Many metaverse spaces separate ownership from utilization rights. Still, there is no efficient market for players to obtain this utilization right, making it difficult for users to build in the metaverse. MAD Radical Market is a use right market where players can access the operational rights of land. Radical Market is a decentralized protocol that establishes a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand.

MAD Radical Public Lease land supply builds on DAO-owned Land Pool and community land pool. MAD will raise money to acquire land across metaverse spaces and put it into the DAO-owned Land Pool. MAD will also call for the community landowners to stake lands to MAD in order to list land in the radical market as a source of additional interest. Users who own metaverse lands or estates can stake their land to MAD. After they stake their asset to MAD, we mint a MAD NFT to the landowner in exchange. Once a user stakes his land, the user can still operate the NFT, such as transferring ownership while staking.

We believe that virtual land is only as valuable as what we build on it. To better utilize the lands in the land pool and leave no land empty, MAD builders build billboards with ads placeholders on top of all lands that are not leased out in the radical market and batch auction all unused land advertising rights to the public. The bundling strategy is ideal for both landowners and advertisers: with a collection of lands, the value of parcels will increase and can put the lands into greater use; for the advertisers, with larger and more land parcels, they will gain more exposure to their business.

### Why are we applying for Decentraland Grant?

Currently MAD is at a very early stage and we are raising money from the community to support the development. Decentraland dev documents are the most well structured and easiest to integrate among the major metaverse platforms. It allows us to interface with the smart contract and elaborates the functionalities such as land operator, land manager, etc. We are confident to build out the entire product on top of Decentraland functionalities and eager to get support and feedback from the first metaverse platform that we are building on.

### How MAD can benefit Decentraland Community

#### Landowners Community

MAD protocol can help the existing Decentraland Landowners monetize and generate additional interest on the land assets through Radical Market and Advertisement Batch Auction. \MAD can also help landowners who don't know how to build easily find builders through our buildersDAO bounty board.

#### Builders

Decentraland has an excellent builders community who are passionate and eager to build. Under MAD there’s a buildersDAO where builders can find bounties more efficiently, and our product Radical Public Lease allows them to get into the space at a lower price. It is essential to both the builders and the Decentraland game because, on the one hand, the feature lowers the bar for both existing and potential builders to get into the space and build. On the other hand, getting more builders to the space is what all metaverse platforms want: we want the world with fully creative builds.

#### General Community

MAD’s Ads Batch Auction and Radical Public Lease lower the bar for the general public to enter the space. Building on top of Decentraland, MAD could attract more people into the Decentraland world.

15310,15310,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Revised proposal for wearable publication fees,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Summary**

This is an updated version of a previous proposal for wearable publication fees. After receiving feedback and input from the community, the previous proposal has been updated to more accurately reflect the risk that a flood of NFT wearables poses to the platform.

**Overview**

The Wearables Editor will allow community content creators to upload collections of the 3D models and textures needed to mint NFT wearables. Before these wearable collections may be minted, they will have to pass through a publication process - part of which includes content moderation and approval to vet out spam and submissions that violate Decentraland's Content Policy.

However, there remains the risk that creators will submit an excessive volume of collections, and/or that collections will be submitted with low-quality content.

**This introduces several very significant risks to the entire Decentraland platform:**

*   A high volume of submissions will slow the approval process for other creators
*   The Catalyst nodes that serve the content for Decentraland incur additional CPU, storage, and bandwidth costs for every wearable item added to the platform
*   When exploring the world, users must download and render every custom wearable encountered
*   Other dApps within the Decentraland platform must process every additional added item, negatively impacting their performance for users

Given the immutability of NFTs, wearables minted in Decentraland will be present forever. They cannot be removed. So, any detrimental effects they have on the performance of the platform cannot be removed.

To mitigate this risk, it is proposed that the DAO collect a publication fee for each item within a collection, regardless of the rarity selected when minting those items. *This fee is not applied to every NFT minted from each item, only the item.*

This fee will be transferred to the DAO and may help fund community grants, reimburse the Curation Committee for their work in vetting submissions, and other initiatives as seen fit by the community.

**These fees can always be lowered or increased, but NFTs can never be removed from the platform.**

**Benefits**

*   Disincentivize creators from submitting spam, thus increasing the rate at which legitimate submissions are approved and published
*   Promotes the submission of very high quality wearables
*   Protects the Decentraland platform from a permanent drop in performance due to a flood of NFT wearables

**Specification**

Each time a creator submits a collection in the Wearables Editor for publication, they must pay a fee in MANA (at the rate decided on by the DAO) for each item. These fees are charged per item in a collection, not per NFT minted from an item.

For example, if an X MANA fee is approved by the DAO, the fees would be as follows.

*   1 Unique item - 1 NFT - total minting cost X MANA
*   1 Mythic Item - 10 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA
*   1 Legendary Item - 100 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA
*   1 Epic item - 1000 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA

- 100 MANA
- 500 MANA
- Other

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

This is the first online hackathon for Russian-speaking auditory which is dedicated to the development of content for DCL.
The hackathon aims to stimulate professionals to create content for DCL, to get 3D designers and developers to know the DCL, and to promote DCL in the media.
https://metaverse.maff.io/hackathon

We are inviting designers and developers who in three days will build objects and scenes in DCL that will be presented at Maff Art Fest on the 11th of December in DCL.

We will create an art park that will feature the artworks which will be done during the hackathon by participants. We are inspired by the Burningman idea
For many participants, this is the only opportunity to show to the public their creations in the DCL.


## Grant size

30,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x961A5398878742192370E4C6590d6d0fFBC047e1

## Description

Now we found ourselves in a situation when there is a big interest for metaverses, particularly in DCL, but not enough information for creators (guides, practical seminars, courses, and experts).

We have a few brands who would like to build their representative offices in DCL but there is a lack of professionals who can realize the project.
The hackathon could help the community to attract more professionals who will start to work with DCL and as the result to bring more interesting content

We're creating a community Maff Metaverse which aims to promote metaverses and bring together designers, developers, and experts. https://metaverse.maff.io/en

We have already attracted more than 100 participants in Hackathon (3D designers and developers) however as we do everything by ourselves there is no valuable money prize so many of the participants who can bring interesting content to DCL are hesitating to participate in Hackathon


## Specification

Obtaining the grant will help us to establish the valuable money prize and attack more professionals to participate in Hackathon. As well as to make a more powerful PR move in the media promoting hackathon and art fest as the first case for Russian speaking auditory therefore promoting DCL as the most developed metaverse to interact with.

10 000 USD -  prize fund for participants of the hackathon
12 000 USD - PR and marketing of hackathon and Metaverse Art Fest
8 000 USD - creation of educational courses (for developers and designers of Decentraland), media content about Decentraland on maff.io and other medias, organization of meet ups to popularise Decentraland, participation in the conferences as speakers, etc

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Decentraland is made of data but it’s technically difficult for the average user to meaningfully collect, interpret and visualize. DCL-Metrics aims to make public data accessible in a relevant way so it can be used by the community to build a better metaverse.


## Grant size

48,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x895Be97bDb9F8a244c472B18EA96DeE39ddf8fe5

## Email address

## Description

**Goal**

Provide fundamental Decentraland metrics to the community for free at <https://www.dcl-metrics.com>

**Current Implementation**

The following metrics are currently implemented, but there are many more features already planned which we will be able to provide with some more work (see the *Roadmap* section):

*   Daily active users
*   Daily active parcels
*   Daily / weekly user metrics
    *   Time spent
    *   Parcels visited
*   Weekly parcel metrics
    *   Average time spent
    *   Average time spent AFK
    *   Logins
    *   Logouts

**Limitations**

*   **Infrastructure costs** - to be able to ramp up the amount of data we make available, we need a bigger database and more powerful servers
*   **Development focus** - the work we've done so far has been paid for from our own pockets and the work on a volunteer basis - a small salary will ensure we are able to devote time and resources to this project


## Specification

**Budget Breakdown**

**TOTAL**: 48k to cover costs for 1 year (~4k / month)

*   Infrastructure costs for 1 year (6k)
*   Salary for development and maintenance (42k)
    *   Backend dev: 1500 / month for 12 months (18k)
    *   Frontend dev: 1500 / month for 12 months (18k)
    *   Designer: as needed (est. 6k in total over 12 months)

**Tech Stack and Approach**

*   Backend: Ruby served via Sinatra API on Heroku
*   Frontend: Next.js + Chakra UI & Nivo charts served on Heroku

We pull data every 90 seconds which gives a reasonably clear picture of traffic. We’ve found this provides an acceptable trade-off between precision and infrastructure strain.

From there we calculate metrics from the raw data - at present this happens once per day, but we have plans to run these jobs more often to more closely approach “live” in-world metrics. For the alpha version, we focused solely on global level aggregations, which are immediately meaningful at a high level such as daily active users and parcels.

**Future Tech // DAO tools**

As part of the research that has gone into this proposal, I’ve had discussions with many members of the Decentraland community including MorrisMustang and howieDoin as [their recent proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=66d76070-0d27-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b) fits quite well with what we are aiming to do.

Whereas the aim of their proposal is to create a robust framework to provide developers reliable access to the public data of Decentraland, our intention is to display that data in an accessible way to end users, regardless of the level of their technical skill.

When the time comes we hope to be able to seamlessly transition from relying on the catalyst servers as a source of data to pulling data more efficiently from Atlas Corp.

I didn't mind at first using my DripAdin and seeing my avatar walk regularly even though his legs are on the carpet.. After a while, i didn't even want to wear the wearable that much.. These amazing NFTs are being devalued by the animation of walking and running when their feet doesn't touch the ground directly because of the wearable. Skateboard looks cool until you closer.. Sitting on a carpet or a cloud looks cool while you're standing still, once you move not so cool. Please keep the feet still or install a glide/hover type of animation for these different types of wearables. Thank you.

Group therapy helps individuals develop communication skills and socialization skills, and allows clients to learn how to express their issues and accept criticism from others. Group therapy allows individuals to develop self-awareness by listening to others with similar issues. Group therapy in Decentraland’s community provides a low-cost alternative to costly, inaccessible health care and support with a community of individuals to support, validate and listen to other group member’s challenges

The group therapy sessions that will be facilitated include:

*   Self-help Group
*   Medication Group
*   Interpersonal Therapy Group
*   Encounter Group
*   Psychodrama Group

Top Reasons People Do Not Go to Therapy:

*   “I’d rather talk to my friends.”
*   “It costs too much.”
*   “I don’t have time.”
*   “What good is talking going to do?”
*   “Therapists don’t say anything; they just sit there and judge you.”
*   “Therapists don’t really care about you; they do it for the money.”

Decentraland Behavioural Group Therapy rules includes:

*   Maintain Confidentiality
*   Commitment to Accountability
*   Limiting Socializing with Group Members
*   Communicate with Words, Not Actions
*   Participation is optional

The therapeutic experience with the community is patient-led, patient-focused and patient-guided. Check out our DAO proposal which expects to be cost-effective, convenient, confidential and connectful. Checkout our DAO proposal and vote while there is still time!

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Add district names to decentraland map.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=112fdf40-dffe-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)

## Summary

Add district names to decentraland map


## Abstract

Identify the distrincts in the decentraland map


## Motivation

Since I entered decentraland for the first time, and today in my day to day life, I see these huge masses of blue land and I never know which district is which.

I see no point in not having your name on the map!


## Specification

The dao should add the district names in a different style than the point of interest.


## Impacts

people will be able to easily identify the districts and understand what those big blue zones are.

The negative point is that some districts seem abandoned and not yet dissolved.
But it would make it easy to find the active and developing districts, for example ethermon district.


## Implementation Pathways

The technical team should decide the style of the names to make it different than the points of interest.
It would be up to your discretion, as well as the way in which the districts can manage the name.


## Conclusion

Add district names to decentraland map to identify them.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Our plan is to make our architecture and interior design company one of the leaders in the design of models for individuals and professionals in the metaverses. We have extensive experience in the field of architectural design and 3D modeling. We work on projects all over the world mainly in the south of France, Canada and Florida. We are a young and dynamic team who master a lot of 3d design softwares (Sketchup, Rhino, 3ds max, Bim). We want to integrate the web3, and particularly the creation and the modeling of new and exclusive universes for our account, or on request for people, or if you have the need for it.


## Grant size

## Description

We created a model on the sandbox, then we looked at Decentraland which we find much more attractive, and the builder is very realistic. We will therefore focus in our next project on creation on the Decentraland builder. Attached are pictures of a model we started that we worked on for two days. This is a draft version. You will also find the character we created there. We tried to take into consideration several parameters by using a single level for the road, we created underground paths
accessible from everywhere and a lot of other details that we studied on plan before
starting to model.

## Specification

Our models are made in a very thoughtful way. That is to say that we have meetings to develop plans, and we plan the whole project in writing before moving forward in the modeling. After testing creation in the virtual world we decided to focus on the metaverses. It is for this reason that we cannot decide overnight to move from creation in the real world to creation in the virtual world. We want to see if we can get help and funds to move forward even more in this project that we love and have been dreaming about for months now. We are ready to reduce our activity as an architecture company to make place for development in metaverses.


## Personnel

allow me to introduce myself. My name is Eddy Chayata, I am the CEO of an architecture and interior design company based in Nice on the French Riviera named Maida. I have extensive experience in the field of architectural design and 3D modeling. I am personally in possession of a degree in architecture (7 years of study) then I specialized in interior
architecture, I obtained a second degree after two and a half years of study in Montreal.
I am very interested in video games and all technological advances.


## Roadmap and milestones

We are a young and dynamic team who master a lot of 3d design softwares (Sketchup, Rhino, 3ds max, Bim). We want to integrate the web3, and particularly the creation and the modeling of new and exclusive universes for our account, or on request for people, or if you have the need for it. We started by testing the main design platforms (Roblox,
Decentraland, The Sandbox). So we wanted to know if it is authorized to create models and sell them ? We would have liked to have an opinion on the models we create to know if we have a future in this field. We want to know the steps to follow to evolve and grow our team to be among the first companies in Europe to carry out architectural projects in the metaverses. We are on the lookout for all the news, we are already using Oculus to discover metaverses in virtual reality and to organize the work of the group. We need your help to create the future. We have already purchased different cryptocurrencies that can be used in metaverses. We absolutely want to be part of this international revolution.

15321,15321,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Proposal for the Decentraland Foundation to receive deploy permissions on road parcels,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Summary**

A proposal to the DAO to grant the Decentraland Foundation deployment permissions on Road parcels for the purpose of deploying content for public events like the upcoming Pride Parade.

**Overview**

During the initial development of the platform, roads were set aside as public spaces to aid content discovery and open exploration of the virtual world. Currently, all of the LAND parcels that make up public roads within Decentraland are owned by the Decentraland DAO. Only the DAO has the permissions to deploy content to these parcels.

By authorizing an externally owned account (EOA) operated by the Decentraland Foundation to become an ""update manager"" of the DAO's LAND and Estates, the Foundation would be able to deploy content and experiences for everyone to enjoy.

**Benefits**

Enabling the Decentraland Foundation to deploy content to public road parcels provides several benefits:

*   Public events are increasing in popularity, boosted by the content built by the Decentraland Foundation. These events help to grow the Decentraland community and to build awareness and excitement for the entire platform. Increasing the LAND available to the Foundation would increase the reach and impact of these events.
*   Specifically, the Decentraland Foundation is hosting a Pride Parade in June to celebrate and promote the rights of LGBTQ+ people and communities. As with physical Pride Parades, Decentraland's parade should be held on public roads. The Foundation needs access to these parcels to deploy the floats and decorations for the event.
*   In addition to events, the Decentraland Foundation can use these deployment permissions to keep public roads up-to-date with interesting and engaging content.
*   An example of another feature that the Foundation could deploy on roads is a tram system linking the major areas of the map. This tram system has already been built, and only needs to be deployed to public roads to make it available. [A demo of the tram system can be seen here.](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/DCL-trams/blob/main/README.md)

**Specification**

Assign an EOA owned by the Decentraland Foundation with the address `0x462ab09f1a75786E0c54ced394E0fB537Af03734` ""update manager"" permissions for all of the DAO's LAND and Estates.

Ownership of these parcels would be maintained by the DAO, and the deployment permissions may be revoked from the Decentraland Foundation at any time via another vote in the DAO. Granting ""update manager"" permissions for the DAO's LAND to this EOA does not grant it the right to transfer or sell the DAO's LAND.

- Grant the Foundation ""update manager"" permissions for the DAO's LAND and Estates
- Deny the Foundation ""update manager"" permissions for the DAO's LAND and Estates

15322,15322,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,SugarClub video server upgrade proposal,"> by 0x474543b99438a978b39d39d8983723eb5ff9196b (SugarClub)

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Sugar Club needs to upgrade to new servers !

Sugar club is the first decentralized club launched in Decentraland in late 2019 during beta, and one of the first venues that started hosting events on the platform before the official DCL launch.

Since then, we have been been hosting an eclectic network of DJs , musicians and artists from the NFT and crypto scene with acclaimed international artists such as Coldie, Connie Digital, Eclectic Method, Bootsy Collins and much more.

With the growing player base that comes to our events, our video  and audio servers need upgrading to satisfy a bigger audience.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xf8d8e8dCA72D41abA3E24518194E9eaF03fdDa86

## Description

With this grant we will use the funds to upgrade to a bigger streaming tier service to accommodate a larger user base, as well as to pay our dev costs associated with it.

Hosting virtual parties , promoting content creators and creating exclusive design wearables is our proud achievement. Sugar Club is now a popular hub for fun , aesthetic and curated parties in the metaverse with a growing brand across the metaverse.

At the moment we use a small dedicated server for video streaming that doesn’t scale properly during peak times at events . Players have reported the video screens freezing or not playing at all at peak times.

While this set up has served us well up until now , it is becoming clear that Decentraland is growing and that in order to accommodate this growth we need funding for upgrading our dedicated servers.


## Specification

Our plan is to scale the servers to a monthly Vimeo subscription as well as creating a dedicated server as back up . This set up could potentially scale up to 1000 users or more during peak times. we believe that for now this should be enough to currently scale.

Therefore we request a grant tier 2 (one time payment of 3000 usd) to fulfill our technical requirements.

The budget break down:

Vimeo premium :                100 usd /month

Dedicated back up server:  250 usd /month

Dev costs:                           50 usd /month

Total :                                 400 usd /month or 4800 usd / year

Requested funds for 1 year (tier 2 ) : 250 usd/month or 3000 usd / year

15323,15323,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections,"> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ee6b1b90-d7fc-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)

## Summary

This proposal calls for attaching voting power to the original six official DCL L1 wearable collections, released in 2019. This includes :1) Community Contest; 2) DCL Launch; 3) Exclusive Masks; 4) Halloween 2019; 5) MCH Collection; & 6) Xmas 2019.


## Abstract

The question of attaching Voting Power (VP) to wearables is an important issue to members of the Decentraland community. To date, there have been at least four (4) proposals surrounding this topic. All of those that passed were approved before the introduction of the three-stage binding governance proposal process. The hope is that the solution proposed herein meets the demands of wearable stakeholders, and is both accepted by other stakeholders and viewed as technically feasible due to its limited application to only the six (6) first and official Decentraland wearables collections.

Previously passed proposals include:

*   On June 14, 2022, a non-binding poll to “Get voting power for your current L1 wearables and strengthen the wider community DAO participation” passed with 1,442,355 VP (76%/52 votes) in favor; 437,946 VP (24%/10 votes) against. This poll established initial community support for attaching VP to L1 wearables, without detailing specific implementation pathways or a detailed impact assessment. It additionally called for a subsequent proposal to determine a tiered VP allocation system based on the rarity category of items.

*   On June 26, 2022, a subsequent non-binding poll for “L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal” passed, with 2,920,657 VP (96%/55 votes) in favor; 146,49 VP (4%/9 votes) against. This poll did not contain any specific information on implementation pathways or impact assessment, however, it built on the previous poll, calling for distribution of VP to L1 wearables based on rarity level along the following parameters:

Mythic: 1000 VP

Legendary: 100 VP

Epic: 10 VP

Rare: 5 VP

Uncommon: 1 VP

The argument against attaching VP to L1 wearables has been primarily technical, with both the DAO Committee and other knowledgeable community members pointing to three primary challenges: First, the broad technical scale of attaching VP to wearables that are distributed across X# collections, all of which are held on separate contracts. Second, is the arbitrary distinction between L1 and L2 wearables, particularly given future conflicts that could arise due to emerging technologies that reduce L1 transaction fees (i.e. zK roll-ups and sidechains) or enable easy bridging of assets between L1 and L2. Third, is the fact that L1 wearables outside of the collections officially sold by DCL involved p2p transactions in which no MANA was burned from the ecosystem, and would effectively be creating double VP for these transactions.

This proposal aims to account for all of these critiques. After conducting an in depth analysis of L1 wearables, total/active voting power, and other VP-allocating assets - including LAND, MANA and Names - we have determined that while a blanket application of VP to all L1 wearables is impractical and difficult to justify, limiting the application to the OG6 official collections is justifiable quantitatively - accounting for nearly 70% of all L1 wearables; technically - being limited to only six (6) wearable collections; and qualitatively - linking VP to official DCL collections, with the amount of VP reasonably comparable to the amount of MANA spent/burned to purchase the one OG collection (Halloween 2019) that was officially sold (rather than given away) to the community.


## Motivation

This proposal seeks to resolve the issue of wearables VP, which has been a point of contention since passage of the first non-binding poll in June 2022. It aims to provide an implementation pathway that distributes wearable VP in as equitable a way as possible, while mitigating technical blockers. It further fulfills a demand that was made by the community with a relatively strong level of support, equating to nearly 20% of historical VP, however, was not enacted by the DAO committee because there was no clear implementation pathway.

While there was no initial promise of VP with purchase of early L1 wearables, assets from the Halloween 2019 collection remain the only officially-sponsored asset in which MANA was spent by community members, burned by the Foundation, and is not associated with any form of VP. The problem with some past solutions proposed by wearable stakeholders to attach VP to ALL L1 wearables is that, a) it is incredibly arduous to implement, particularly when considering distributing VP by rarity of each collection; b) it is somewhat arbitrary in that there is no precedent for such a VP-generating act; and c) In the majority of cases it would in fact be creating double VP in that wearables were purchased in a p2p transaction in which no MANA was burned, so the seller would have received MANA equating to VP and the buyer a wearable equating to VP. As a result of the above, an all encompassing L1 solution is technically impractical and both quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to justify.

The Halloween 2019 collection, however, was the first wearable collection after the Exclusive Masks beta, and the only collection partially sold by the Decentraland Foundation, raising 1,077,320 MANA in sales. Although subsequent collections in the 2019 wearable offerings were distributed for free or as a reward, this spent MANA, which was removed from the ecosystem, has not received any democratic utility. By attaching VP to these “initial offering” wearable collections (and only to these initial six), which are the foundation of the robust wearables market we see today, this proposal aims to assert wearables as an essential asset class - similar to MANA, LAND, and Names.


## Specification

Attach voting power, distributed by rarity to the six (6) official Decentraland wearable collections released in 2019. This includes:

1.  Community Contest
2.  DCL Launch
3.  Exclusive Masks
4.  Halloween 2019
5.  MCH Collection
6.  Xmas 2019

*   There are 48,620 total wearables in these six collections, spread across 7,583 wallets. This equates to nearly 70% of the 71,082 total L1 wearables, which are spread across 10,442 unique wallets.

VP will be distributed according to rarity as follows:

*   Mythic: 1000 VP

*   Legendary: 100 VP

*   Epic: 10 VP

*   Rare: 5 VP

*   Uncommon: 1 VP

*   There are 644 mythic across 189 unique wallets; 4,249 Legendary across 827 unique wallets; 17,382 Epic across 4,820 unique wallets; and 24,713 rares across 4,126 unique wallets.

In total this will create **1,796,691 VP**. This equates to less than 10% of the historically active VP in the DAO, and is less than 2x the amount of MANA spent (and burned) by community members to purchase Halloween 2019 wearables from the Decentraland Foundation.

\[Impacts & Implementation pathways are available for discussion on the Forum (https://forum.decentraland.org/t/draft-cumulative-layer-1-wearables-vp-proposal/11423), and will be included in the final Binding Governance Proposal]


## Impacts

The underlying philosophy behind this proposal is that creating new VP and expanding participation in the DAO is inherently positive! Empowering various stakeholder groups makes our overall system more robust, and if anything, voter apathy is more of a risk than interest group consolidation of power - which this proposed pathway also mitigates by limiting the amount of VP that is being created as part of this process, by restricting it to particular L1 collections.

There is some concern, however, that restricting VP to the original six 2019 collections increasingly favors a particular sector of the Decentraland Community, that already has significant holdings when compared to newer entries into the ecosystem. One mitigation pathway would be to extend voting power to official L1 collections from 2020 as well; or as has been discussed previously, to apply VP to all L1 wearables, regardless of collection. These mechanisms are however not under consideration as part of this current proposal, and should this proposal fail, could be reconsidered by the Wearables VP Working Group.


## Implementation Pathways

The Snapshot Voting Strategy for this proposal will be configured as follows:

{
""symbol"": ""WEARABLE"",
""collections"": \[
""0x32b7495895264ac9d0b12d32afd435453458b1c6"",
""0xd35147be6401dcb20811f2104c33de8e97ed6818"",

],
""multipliers"": {
""mythic"": 1000,
""legendary"": 100,
""epic"": 10,

}
}

A draft version of the strategy - which will be reviewed and can be implemented if this measure passes the binding governance proposal stage - can be found at the following link:
https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/pull/606


## Conclusion

These six (6) original wearable collections from 2019 are the final group of initial offering assets that have no associated VP. Other assets in this category include MANA, LAND and Names. What unites these assets are the fact that they are tied to either the core Decentraland smart contracts, or were linked to a foundation-led asset sale in which MANA was burned or the assets were distributed freely to early project adopters.

Voting in favor of this proposal is meant to put a close to the question of creating additional voting power assets in the future. This final section of the proposal should be referred to if there are further attempts to use past precedent as an argue for extending VP to additional asset sets or categories.

## Description

Did you know, communication with astronauts on Earth’s moon has a latency (delay) of 1.25 seconds?

Due to the protocols used, live video in the Decentraland world is delayed at around 10-20 seconds. This makes live events infeasible. For example, live video calls or interactive events take 20 seconds to get a response.

This project introduces new ultra low latency streaming components to the decentraland SDK and builder to support ultra low latency video. Latency will reduce to ~1 second.

These components will allow scene builders to easily incorporate ultra low latency video in their scenes.

### Background

In recent years, global investment in technology and infrastructure underlying ultra low latency video streaming has been significant.  Live streaming is set to explode in the coming years with low latency video being a big driver behind new applications in entertainment, gaming, media, education, acedemia.

Ultra low latency video streaming typically operates on a sub 1 second delay.
This project will integrate this hot, deep technology into the Decentraland platform.

### Competitive Advantage

Metaverses such as Facebook's Meta already have native low-latency video
and are building a strong portfolio of apps based on this technology. Other
Metaverses do not yet have low latency video streaming technology.

### Experimental Prototype

A video demonstration of the components I have developed is here:

https://youtu.be/ml7nlTEk3p8

This video shows a working prototype of an experimental Decentraland SDK component featuring a low latency video stream.

The video is streaming from North America to a video streaming server in Hong Kong (on Microsoft Azure) and then back to North America and into a Decentraland scene running in the browser.

The clock times on the right side are the current time whereas the time on the left, in the Decentraland scene, are latent due to the transit time around the planet and the subsequent decoding and rendering of the video.

Total time is demonstrated to be around 1 second.

A 5 year old laptop with no GPU was used for the test. The video resolution is set to 640x360.

The experimental prototype includes modifications to the Decentraland Unity Renderer and Kernel and adds a new video component to the SDK.

### Example Use Cases

It is difficult to imagine a virtual future that runs on a 20 second delay.  Use cases that need lower latency might include:

*   Any live interaction such as video calls.
*   Live events where people communicate from the virtual world to the real world.
*   Any use cases that include augmentation of the virtual world with a real object (augmented virtuality).
*   Virtual workspaces
*   Virtual learning spaces that requires interaction
*   Remote control of real world devices such as drones. (yikes!)
*   Immersive commerce
*   Gaming applications

### Existing DAO pre-Proposal

An existing pre-proposal that covers this feature is here, from Tobik#7989. Note however this is a request for a protocol change, the proposed feature would likely be an additional component so that backwards compatibility is maintained:

https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0627a110-2fd6-11ec-ac84-77607720a240


## Specification

### High Level Summary

## Description

Our vision is to offer a hub for musicians, performers and other artists to learn, share knowledge and expand and elevate the DCL community. It will be a community-driven venue for artists and musicians to perform in and launch their metaverse careers. The backbone will be learning through the sharing of knowledge. This project will offer a place for musicians to grow their skills, learn how to leverage Web3 in business and grow their careers.

We plan to re-stream archived programming between Live knowledge presentations with a long term goal to sell video ad space for branded content and also renting out the venue to raise funds to sustain the growth of the collective once the grant funds are exhausted.

The team is made up of two founders who have dedicated many hours of time performing, developing and being a core part of the DCL community. Our experience is very well rounded in visual art, music and Web3 development. Complimenting each other’s skills and knowledge, we have a wide range of knowledge to share and skill building curriculum.

All of our knowledge sharing programming is free to all DCL users.

We have participated and performed in NFT openings, DJ parties, Art Heists, The Metaverse Music Festival and more. We are continuously on our quest to learn and share knowledge. We intend to do so with the following:

    *   Giving the community of learners a space to hone their craft and promote their art
    *   Live programming each week

*   All programming is free
*   Attracting new, fresh talent to the space
*   More events for newcomers to explore increasing growth via the network effect

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Create a task force to develop and maintain a public registry of individuals and organizations offering their services to build content on Decetraland’s platform. The goal is to provide trusted information to brands coming into the space looking for talented builders who can help with events production, wearables making, 3d modeling, and SDK programming.

This is a revised version of [a previous grant proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f9561670-fdfb-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a).

## Description

As the Metaverse concept goes mainstream there are more brands coming into the space willing to build a presence in Decentraland. However, creating 3D content can be a daunting task and most organizations will prefer to hire experienced professionals.

Decentraland creators are one of the most valuable audiences Decentraland has at this point. It’s critical to provide them a platform to promote their services, become more visible, get new clients and grow into a sustainable business.

Making a public and official registry of Verified Partners will promote transparency between brands and creators. This initiative aims to democratize access to qualified suppliers and generate new business opportunities for them.

The goal of this project is to survey all creators in Decentraland’s community and list them in a public registry of creators, the Verified Partners Registry. Freelancers and studios alike will be classified based on their info and the services they provide. The registry will be curated by a team, ensuring the authenticity and quality of the information displayed.

These services are already being offered and requested on other platforms such as [fiverr.com](https://es.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=decentraland) and [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/job-search/decentraland/), which is great validation that the market exists. This project aims to support the growth of the industry with a dedicated registry of professionals in this industry, which is free and open to use.


## Specification

This grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds its objectives.

The proposed Verified Parters Registry will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7). This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.

The grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet. The key holders are Alejandro Escoda, Yemel Jardi and maraoz in their respective capacity as Squad Member, DAO Committee Member and Trusted Community Member.

The public registry will first launch as a dedicated page in Decentraland’s documentation site, a testing version of it is [already available here](https://docs.decentraland.vote/talent-hub/). Once a substantial number of providers are included the team migrate the directory to its own domain for a richer experience (searching, filtering, applying and more).

The criteria to include a partner in the registry shouldn’t be a matter of taste, but instead a list of verifications about the partner company and the services they claim to provide. Making sure they are correctly classified under different categories/filters. On top of that a layer of reviews from clients could increase transparency and be signal of quality.


## Personnel

Total Hours: ~240 monthly hours or ~60 weekly hours.

*   Producer - Agustin Pagano ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agustinpz/))
*   Producer - Alejandro Escoda ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-escoda-242295245))

Budget: $8,200 USD per month or a total of $49,200 USD

*   Team compensation: $43,200 USD
*   Operational budget: $6,000 USD


## Roadmap and milestones

**August - Bootstrapping the registry**

*   Design interview and verification process.
*   Define a strategy to source potential partners and set up inbound request flow.
*   Initiate interview process for partners providing Wearable Creation, Architecture, and SDK Development.

**September - Iteration of the process**

*   Review the results, evaluate improvements and automation opportunities.
*   Initiate interview process for partners providing Event Production and Full Cycle Production.

**October - Complete the registry**

*   Explore the addition of new service categories (e.g. animation, audio, land rental).
*   Produce a report of “Metaverse Workers”, a summary of the collected info.

**November - Migrate to its own site**

*   Define requirements to migrate the registry enabling a richer user experience.
*   Prototype the new version of the registry.

**December - Launch new registry**

*   Set up in production the new version of the registry.
*   Announcement and support for new onboarding flows.

**January - Maintenance**

*   Documentation of the process to maintain the registry functional.
*   New release of the Metaverse Workers report.

By the end of this project, this team will have a complete mapping of the industry’s experts and a trusted tool to browse them. This project should be a platform for new creators jumping into the industry and a key resource for organizations looking for a partner to build content inside Decentraland.

This project will give everyone in the Decentraland a backstage pass within Decentraland  to their top-tier stand-up favorites, while providing a reason to socialize and gather with community members.

We propose to build an amphitheater that comedy fans can convene at to watch the hilarity at Skankfest ensue, while also providing the structure to create a comedy hub for the release of fresh content and events in the future.


## Specification

Acquiring funding through the DAO will make it possible for Decentral Comedy to handle all facets of planning, marketing, content curation, content production and allow Metaverse Architects to take care of development. The following is a breakdown of key areas we will focus on:

Planning:
Skankfest features a full lineup of talented acts across 6 stages, over a three-day period. Decentral Comedy will plan the full marketing campaign utilizing the Gas Digital Network to promote Decentraland as the hub of comedy in the metaverse:

●	We will promote that in order to gain backstage access to this sold out show, patrons will have to visit Decentral Comedy’s Skankfest DCL experience
●	We will prepare to have a full team at the event (including a VR camera) to capture the best of what Skankfest has to offer
●	In anticipation of the event, there will be a 3 month onboarding period to introduce comedy fans into the Decentral Comedy space
●	This will also include the huge logistical effort to ensure the smooth running of the DCL Skankfest schedule

Marketing:
The robust marketing strategy will include:

●	Official marketing through Skankfest and on official branding channels
●	Set up of a Decentraland Green Room Podcast Station at Skankfest along with branding and signage
●	In-person attendance by the Decentral Comedy team

●	4 All-Access passes as a giveaway prize on DCL or social media (valued at $500 USD per ticket)
●	Logo will appear on all promotional material
●	Post Festival Email Featuring Decentraland

Content:
Decentral Comedy will secure access to the exclusive Backstage At Skankfest content. This content will be packaged and produced for an exclusive premiere in DCL

We will also capture one-on-one interviews with top comics that includes taking questions from users live in DCL/discord and connecting the fans in DCL directly with the comics.

Development:
Property for the build will either be rented or purchased. It will be developed to look like a large amphitheater and feature a dynamic screen with live streaming capability, fitted with a high-quality sound system.

In the first version, the players will have 2 skills: Health and Magic. Both the skills will have a maximum level of 99. Players earn xp as they play the game (Magic xp for using magic spells and Health xp for healing). Health will determine the maximum healthpoints a player can have while Magic will determine the damage the player can deal to other players (and potentially unlock new spells).

Combat:
Combat will be many vs one. On killing another player (Last damage) , you receive half of their bounty while the other half gets added to your bounty. Last player gets the remaining bounty.
Magic Spells will be used to attack other players in the game. The spellbook will consider of many different spells with each having different attributes (maximum damage, accuracy,
speed/reload time, minimum skill needed to use, special attributes).
Apart from the spellbook, each player will also get a fixed quantity food which they can use to heal during the game.

Drops and Rewards:
Apart from the bounty earned by killing players during the game, players will also receive Reward chests. Opening these chests will give them NFT items that can be consumed during the game for an advantage (example: portions to boost your damage by 5% for next 3 attacks)


## Specification

Python server hosted on a google cloud VM will handle all the game logics.

Player details and game state will be stored on firebase for the time being.

All NFT drops and items will be handled using smart contracts on polygon chain.

Most of the game logics have been explained in the description.

Feel free to hit me up with any follow-up questions

I am going to be in the process of looking for land soon and just reaching out to land owners is very complicated. Can there be a simpler way? Can we message them in the marketplace where their assets are & attach the asset in message, so they know and get notifications while on the site. I had to airdrop a person a NFT saying, i am interested in his land and for him to add my discord. The seller and customer's communication bridge seems to be closed as of now.

Now, i am two months in Decentraland and i have to scroll and sometimes my items don't load or they are still loading.. Can we please have a saved outfits section where we can have save up to 10 outfits and load them up.. There are times when i am making my outfit and in the middle of making it, it resets back to normal which can be frustrating for some..

## Abstract

**Reason for the Grant**

Decentraland needs a more personal content reaching out to people outside the community, there are many people that joined and left right away because they simply didn't understand that Decentraland is more then just a game. I want to change this, I want to get those people back to Decentraland with my influential status that i have build so far in this community.

I already started to make content in my own non formal method because thats more personal, The character as InJesterr is supposed to be a friend and not a educator which is also the reason why people always can reach out to me with confidence.
I do work on many projects & platforms think of Tiktok, Instagram, Youtube, Discord & the most personal Twitch.


## Grant size

10,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x2EBB0E88c6eDeAeF1D912bEE639A9e6acC2Ed418

## Description

**Explanation**
Before people from Decentraland did'nt have much to do then Choose from a few games party and try to attend at events. The key thing that held people back then was Decentraland Games, Wondermine, Parties & Golfcraft.

Since we have so much progress in DCL since last year, i think we can finally convince those people to join DCL back or just join. The community that will eventually come back &
the new players have the option to choose between a variety of P2E games, festivals, events & do have the option to still attend at the OG key things.

***Promises i can make***

*   I will be streaming as much as P2E games as i can.
*   I will make personal & not formal videos to reach out to the audience.
*   I will host events, rent/buy a land to host events, parties & games on & create wearables.
*   Tiktok Short videos, Youtube main videos, Youtube short videos, Instagram reel, Twitter posts, Discord events *(700 Members)*, Host DCL Events & giveaways.
*   Start DCL Building models, smart contracts on land.
*   Deploying awareness of Decentraland and try to keep it great like it already is.

In the **Specification** i will mention what the money is exactly going to be used for & how.


## Specification

**Grant specification**
To fullfill these promises I'm going to need a grant of $10.000,00 with my team.
We are going to use this grant over upcomming 3 to 6 months.
There is a posibility of us asking another grant after this period of time since this is only the building phase.

You might question about the amount of the grant that I'm asking, but after my explanation I hope you will be able to think that this grant is totally worth it & reasonable.

I believe an ""Add to Cart"" feature would help buying multiple NFTs at a time.. I like to purchase more than one item at a time and most of the time after i am finished buying one NFT, i tend to lose the last page i was on and have to go searching for it through DCL's marketplace. It would be cool if we could have it added to the cart & click on each wearable bringing us to Metamask to sign off for each one.

## Motivation

I don't know where to begin. We have sold thousands of NFTs and have even given out over 71,000 promo NFTs so far daily to the decentraland community. We are in love with the Decentraland metaverse as most players already know. We continue to grow daily on twitter and already invite them to our Waifumon parties in Decentraland and other Metavereses like Sandbox. Everyone asks us all the time they wish there NFTs could be cross platformed to all metaverses and I think this finally the first step. Would be honored to be apart of this history so open to pivot or change anything we need to do so to make it happen. Thanks again!

The Catalyst Nodes Monitor (https://catalyst-monitor.vercel.app/) shows Decentraland currently has around 1,000-1,800 active members at any given time. The low amount of active users may be a result of a large percentage of Decentraland being undeveloped or underdeveloped. The majority of Decentraland being underdeveloped may be a result of land owners not having the skills or resources needed to develop the amazing experiences we all know Decentraland is capable of rendering.

To address the underdeveloped land and lack of high-quality user engagement zones, should the marketplace be expanded to match two new sets of market participants?

*   Match land owners  with renters
*   Match people who need DCL developers  with people who specialize in DCL development (modeling, blockchain programming, game developers, etc...)

I think this is an easy extension to the Decentraland marketplace that would significantly increase the amount of development in DCL, which would increase the number of active members. What do you think?

The Decentraland Discord server currently serves to match these sets of market participants through open discussion, but a lot of the third-party brokers that offer such services are poorly done, inactive, largely centralized, or expensive. Decentraland has an opportunity to offer a built-in solution to reduce fees, improve user engagement, and grow the community.

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[Halt the implementation of the Governance Proposal to adjust the creators fee to reflect a set fiat value of $500](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e1fcd600-d7a2-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)

## Summary

Set the wearable submission to $150 USD worth of MANA and set the curators compensation to $50 USD per item reviewed.


## Abstract

This proposal aims to align the DCL community about how the wearable submission fee should be structured. The proposal gives more context about the history, motivations and economics of the fee and also proposes a new scheme.


## Motivation

The Wearables Marketplace was originally launched on  [June 1st 2021](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/) , with the goal of empowering a creators economy by giving users a wide variety of choices to express themselves and giving creators the tools to monetize their work.

Every creator that submits a new wearable to the marketplace is asked to pay a fee in MANA (Wearable Submission Fee). This fee is necessary to:

*   Cover the compensation of the curator that will review the submission to ensure technical soundness and protect against IP infringements.

*   Limit the cost of *perpetually* hosting the wearable in the Catalyst Decentralized Network.

*   Foster the continual growth of Decentraland platform and its community via giving those fees to the DAO and funding the Community Grants program.

The wearable submission fee was originally set to 500 MANA, with a MANA price of ~0.8 USD. However when the MANA price reached the $2 USD mark the community raised their concerns via  [a proposal to automatically adjust the fee to a fixed amount of 500 USD payable in MANA was voted.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)

The proposal noted that pegging the publication fee to USD was healthy for the creators’ economy. It allows the creators to better budget their projects and market their services without exposing them to the fluctuation of the MANA price.

The proposal was raised to the Security Advisory Board and decided to lower the wearable submission fee one-time to 100 MANA as a temporary measure in the waiting for an automated solution. This change was announced in the  [DAO Committee Report #12](https://decentraland.org/blog/project-updates/dao-committee-report-12/) .

Since then, the price of MANA has come down to the $1 USD mark and the current fee seems too low. The curator committee is getting 10 MANA per item review and it doesn’t seem up to the responsibility of the role. At the same time, going back to a 500 USD fee is shocking for new creators in the Decetraland community.

This proposal aims to restructure the current wearable submission fee to a more sustainable framework. The goal is to keep the fee at minimum while still covering the expenses for the marketplace to work.


## Specification

Below is the specification of how the Wearable Submission Fee should be structured:

*   The fee amount should be set at a fixed USD price, but paid in MANA.

*   The fee should cover the work of a curator to review the submission.

*   The fee should support the catalyst network.

*   The fee should support the DAO to continue investing in Grants.

The first item has been addressed by the Decentraland Foundation team by creating a new version of the marketplace smart contracts that uses a Chainlink oracle to get the current MANA price. This way the fee is paid in MANA but the amount is set in USD.

Regarding the compensation of the curator for each review, a price of **$50 USD per item reviewed** seems fair. The curation might take between 30 minutes and several hours depending on the feedback cycles with creators.

The catalyst network is currently formed by 11 servers that hosts all the content of Decentraland’s world, including wearable 3d models, scene content and avatar selections. Half of the Catalyst servers are runned by Decentraland Foundation and the rest by individual community members.

The cost of hosting a Catalyst server is ~600 USD per month. The total annual cost to run the 11 servers is ~$80,000 USD. At this moment this cost is paid by catalyst owners and is not subsidized by the DAO, but it totally should, **and part of the Wearable Submission Fee should be allocated to subsidize catalyst owners.**

In the past year 5,530 wearables have been submitted to the marketplace, so if we maintain this publication rate, **a fee of 15 USD per wearable** should be enough to account for catalyst expenses for a year.

And finally, the DAO should get a fee to continue investing in the Grants Program, fostering the development and growth of the platform. **A contribution between 50 and 100 USD should be allocated for this purpose.**

**Wearable Submission Fee = 150 USD**

*   33% = 50 USD go to the curator
*   10% = 15 USD to supporting catalyst servers
*   57% = 85 USD goig to the DAO to support the Grant’s Program.


## Conclusion

This proposal aims to set the wearable submission fee to a USD value in order to better support the creators economy, derisking them from market volatility, enabling to budget projects and market their services at a expectable rate.

Economics considerations have been made to ensure that a fee of 150 USD can cover the compensation of the curators, a subsidy to the catalyst network and keep reinvesting in the growth of the platform.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Proposal to make a one-time donation to the Blender Foundation fund for their continued outstanding work of over 15 years building  an open source 3D creation tool. This is an opportunity to support the infrastructure that millions of content creators use for creating, optimizing, and converting avatars and worlds.

In my opinion it is also a powerful PR move for the crypto industry to make regarding the open metaverse, similar to how mainstream cultural icons are buying and changing their pfps to NFTs. The Decentraland logo can sit above Steam (which recently banned crypto) and Google (which centralized much of the web).

## Description

This proposal is partly inspired by this great post, ""We Need More Open Source in Gaming"": https://a16z.com/2016/06/01/open-source-gaming-vr/

""A rising tide lifts all boats.""

Blender is an open source 3D content-creation program that lays at the center of 3D workflows like an indispensible swiss army knife tool. Its used by millions of people - in 2020 alone there were 14M downloads. The subreddit has almost 500k members and there have been over 100 books published covering Blender.

As a creator that's made virtual worlds and avatars across dozens of platforms (including Decentraland) I've used Blender for:

*   creating, fixing, and optimizing 3D models and avatars
*   converting between different 3D file formats (great glTF support)
    *   20k meebits were made into usable avatar files using Blender
*   High quality renders, lightmapping, and animations
*   Exporting content directly to web based virual worlds

Features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing.

One of the foundation's goals is ""to give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core"".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_Foundation

Blender is GPL licensed, ensuring that the code will be free as a public good for all time. It protects the developer and user community from malicious patents, hostile forks, lock-down attempts, bait-and-switch-to-closed. Other software that is GPL licensed include the Linux kernel and wordpress. [Learn more](https://www.blender.org/about/license/)

It'll be iconic for Decentraland to be the first crypto-native project to be a sponsor and have its logo displayed here next to tech giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Unity, Epic, Nvidia, Steam, Microsoft, etc: https://i.imgur.com/oK3sIrw.png

\~12,100 MANA per year
\~60.5k MANA for 5 years

It's ~ <1% of the MANA released (https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac), a small cost to send a large industry message about where we stand on software freedom and the open metaverse. I think it's a smart PR move, like how Visa bought a Cryptopunk.

Blender currently employs 26 full time employees, and 12 freelancers remotely. Unity has over 5000. We need more open source in gaming.

## Specification

This is a one time donation to Blender fund which in return will get the Decentraland Logo next to the likes of Google, Steam, Adobe, Microsoft, Activision, etc. I'll continue to advocate for public goods funding across the twittersphere to help ensure an open metaverse ecosystem thrives over the next decade.

15348,15348,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Fashion School Graduate Makes Wearables,"> by 0x4b75968043b77e01488ac98da5d99ebb0c2c73fe (Deni#73fe)

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

I have created a set of clothing items that include matching sweatshirt, sweatpants, bucket hat and shoes in a variety of different colors. I am a recent graduate from fashion school and have taught myself how to use Blender to create wearables just for Decentraland. My goal for this project is to not only create inclusive clothing items but to give back to Decentraland by continuing to create unique and desirable clothing items.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x4B75968043b77e01488ac98DA5d99Ebb0C2c73fe

## Description

I am a newer user to Decentraland and while I have greatly enjoyed it so far, I quickly noticed that the current clothing available lacks inclusivity and uniqueness. I have created a gender neutral clothing line that everyone will be able to wear and enjoy. This clothing line will bring a new standard for inclusivity to Decentraland.

This clothing line is based off of everyday street wear that still has uniqueness and creativity. The pieces are trendy, fashionable and the people wearing them will be proud to walk around and show them off. I am passionate about fashion and I am exciting to see how fashion is going to evolve in Decentraland. It is something that I greatly wish to be a part of and want to continue to release new pieces on a regular basis.

As a recent fashion grad, I want to use the skills that I have learned in a project that I really care about, like Decentraland. I believe that our future lies in the virtual world and Decentraland is at the forefront of this with their current product. With my background in fashion and schooling during this time of technological advancement, this something that I really wish to become a part of. The only component that I am lacking in my vision is the funding to make this possible.


## Specification

This project is 100% complete and has been uploaded and tested in Decentraland builder. I used the wearable reference models available in Google Drive to create these pieces. I have spent countless hours teaching myself Blender to create quality pieces. I have also created all of the social media pages related to this project and have begun growing a community that supports my vision.

This is a link to two examples that I have created: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yhYg-qC6YkMTWMNzzoAf5zU7pzWGKBo7?usp=sharing


## Personnel

Myself - I need help!

I have taken this head on by doing my own research, learning from videos, and a lot of trial and error until I figured things out. I am passionate about fashion and want to make my footprint in the Decentraland fashion world. I have a degree from fashion school and I spend a lot of time keeping up with the current trends. Technology has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember and I am quick to pick up on how to use various platforms and softwares. I also have a degree in marketing and business administration which provides me with the knowledge on how to grow my community as well as manage the business aspect of this project. With all of this combined, I am confident in saying that this collection will be a success and I will be able to use profits from this collection towards future collections in order to keep up with the growth of Decentraland.


## Roadmap and milestones

Week 1-2 : Marketing: includes gaining a following and building hype around the launch date of my clothing line through Discord, Twitter, Instagram, and promotion from other content creators

Week 3-4 : Post collection for approval, continue to drop sneak peaks of the collection, and get people hype to make their purchases

Week 5: Throw parties in Decentraland where people will gather and show off their new outfits. More promotional actions will be taken during these parties to make people excited for the next time I drop a new clothing line.  I plan to have frequent fashion shows.

I will do giveaways throughout this process to people who support me and are looking forward to my future collections.

I have a degree in information systems, I have always worked in the area of ​​systems and marketing.

Since I met Decentraland I saw the need for technical content for those who speak Portuguese, such as how to configure the wallet, save using polygon network and etc...

I met a lot of new people in this universe, some of them today help me to take care of the community, but we all face several obstacles due to the lack of incentive from the game for people like us, we hope that this DAO motivates us even more to create content frequently

15352,15352,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should we convert 1/8th of the DAO’s MANA to stablecoin to diversify and stabilize the treasury?,"> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc

#### Summary

Given the amount of MANA owned by the Decentraland DAO, we should diversify these holdings between Decentraland's native token (MANA) and stable coins to make the DAO’s treasury more secure.

**The DAO should allocate one-eight (1/8) of the treasury, or `4,357,187` MANA, to a portfolio of stable coins including equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.**

The added stability resulting from this diversification will better empower the DAO to fulfill its various financial obligations (e.g. the community grants program) over a longer period of time.

While the formation of a DAO Treasury Committee might result in a more complex and performant financial strategy, this initial proposal aims to suggest a simple change that our community can make right now to immediately help to protect and sustain the DAO's funding.

#### Abstract

On February 20, 2020, the Decentraland DAO was created and given 222 million MANA by means of a 10 year vesting contract. (Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the [DAO's vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO.

As of the time this proposal was published,  `34,857,497` of that MANA is now available to the DAO's treasury. At a current market value of ~150,000,00 USD.

The Treasury also has 5,392,411 USD in stable coins at the moment used to fund grants. The original proposal to convert 1/5 of the Treasury to stablecoins [was approved here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b89db0-de87-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372).

Maintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c02ff450-2783-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) specifies new grant tiers to be paid in stablecoins.
Maintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.

Many other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.

***In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/8th of its treasury (or  `4,357,187` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.***

The remaining 7/8ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.

#### Specification

1/8th of the DAO's existing treasury, or  `4,357,187`  MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, in equal proportions. Using the current price of MANA (4.8 USD/MANA) this transaction will generate ~`20,914,498` USD

The transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig using DEX protocols over a period of several weeks ensuring to get an average price and minimizing the impact on markets liquidity.

#### For

Approve the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.

#### Against

Reject the proposed asset allocation.

15354,15354,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should NAME owners be granted proportional DAO rights? (100 VP per name owned).,"> by 0x02dcce9e0aa57881dd15d09ad904c6ff93f0c059 (Krunch)

Hello community,

**DISCLAIMER**:
I propose this question with complete transparency that I own 100+ names myself and have a bias to this proposal. With that being disclosed, lets get to the details!

**PROPOSAL**:
NAME owners receive 100 VP per name owned. Just as MANA holders receive 1 for 1 VP per MANA, NAME holders (who put their MANA to work and also burn it out of existence) should receive 1 for 1 VP proportional to the cost of minting a name.

**BACKGROUND**:
Current DAO participants are MANA holders and LAND holders. LAND owners being granted 2,000 VP per land and MANA holders a 1 for 1 VP per MANA. As it shows, NAME owners currently hold no VP even though contributions to acquire names are arguably the most contributory to the state of Decentraland between the 3; minting a name requires the cost of 100 MANA (which is burnt out of existence!) as well as gas fees, which we all know can be outrageous at times.

I will spare you all the argument of whether or not the minting cost of names should be lowered or not, but I will point out that compared to acquiring LAND, minting a name is dirt cheap. Not only does owning a NAME differentiate you from the flurry of ""User#1fj49"" Metaversers that populate Decentraland, but it is also a domain name -- which can be attached to a parcel (and a 1/1 NFT)!  I am not proposing this question as a means of adding extra utility to make my name investments sell better, but rather give those who do not have thousands of MANA to acquire LAND and also wish to have a unique identity in the next frontier of the internet, a say in how Decentraland progresses.

Given the recent major developments from the Decentraland dev team in how the DAO operates, I believe it will serve the community well to allow more members to participate in the direction of Decentraland. Since I joined the community a few months ago, I have learned that Decentraland is filled with so many helpful people -- whether it be a newcomer who has a plethora of questions, an up and coming NFT artist who is debuting their work, I have seen more examples than I can count with my fingers of instances of community members going out of their way to show support! Lets try and put more power into the little guys' hands that weren't here on Launch Day, but want to participate and don't have to feel like they are going against all odds when voting versus massive whales that can influence an entire vote themselves.

- YES
- NO

## Abstract

SinfulMeatStick (Sinful) is a highly supportive, essential Decentraland (DCL) community builder and Twitch streamer. Through his company, SinfulMedia, he is seeking DAO funding to help continue providing high-value content to the DCL community, as well as help provide streaming services to fellow community members who may not have this resource free of cost.

As a Twitch streamer, show host, community builder, and content creator, Sinful has worked with established DCL groups, projects, and wearable creators such as The Babydolls, The Rocking Uniquehorns (TRUs), Penguin Fight Club, Tangpoko, and Kirzoz. Financial assistance from the DAO will allow Sinful to focus his full attention on creating, building, and expanding the DCL community.

## Description

As one of the most active Twitch streamers and content creators in Decentraland, Sinful has been creating and onboarding new users in the space for more than eight months, an accomplishment he says fills him with gratitude and pride. Sinful also hosts a weekly show titled, “Beyond The NFT,” which is streamed simultaneously on Twitch and in Decentraland.

During the last five months, he has interviewed some of the most iconic figures of DCL, including Roustan, Aaron Leupp, Tangpoko, Micheal K, DoctorDripp, and many more. Additionally, “Beyond the NFT” has been a springboard for many aspiring musical talents in DCL, such as CIB and BabyYors. Recently, Sinful interviewed Kelly Ann Collins, founder, and CEO of VultLab and Into The Meta News (https://kac.start.page/).

Sinful also hosts the highly engaging, weekly Twitter Spaces talk, “Decentraland Community Building,"" along with long-serving DCL community member, Canessa. During the show, Sinful and Canessa give community members a stage to voice their feelings, ideas, and concerns about Decentraland, and they also discuss ways on how we can bring web2 audiences into our home world, Decentraland.

Sinful is a founder of the Community Building Decentraland (CBD) Discord server, where Decentraland community members are actively engaging with one another in efforts to build a stronger and more collaborative Decentraland environment. Since the launch of this Discord server, it has quickly become a hub for many DCL communities to connect, network, and create, as well as share knowledge and resources. Sinful is active in numerous web3 Twitter Spaces, always inviting artists, singers, and creators to join and explore the possibilities this space has to offer. Sinful also invests much of his time in welcoming and onboarding new members to the DCL community, a personal approach that he believes is of primary importance to retaining new users.

Many of you may know me as the manager of the TRU Band Room--I'm ShelleyVan. I've been a DCL citizen since July 2021. In that time I've planned and hosted nearly 300 live events and onboarded nearly 100 musicians and countless new users. During this time, Sinful has remained an integral part of the community-building process, providing a friendly voice and wealth of web3 knowledge to anyone I send his way. As part of the DCL ecosystem, Sinful is crucial for growth.


## Specification

Funding from the DAO will allow Sinful to continue providing content to our Decentraland communities and, through SinfulMedia, provide high-quality streaming services to fellow DCL members free of cost. He also plans to make user-friendly “how to” videos to make the flow of information easily digestible for new users. Both “Beyond The NFT” and “Decentraland Community Building” Twitter Space are broadcast to Twitch and Decentraland via RTMP server, providing clear content of the highest quality in Decentraland and on Twitch.

The RTMP server is Sinful’s biggest financial consideration and continuing to fully fund that server often stifles his creative process, which neglects the community of valuable content and community building. Keeping the RTMP server funded is crucial for the onboarding of new musicians, artists, and DJs by allowing Sinful to provide them a stage on which to perform.

Preliminary work Beyond The NFT: Average 30 viewers on twitch and 40-50 users on parcel
https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=c66eb4bb-9035-4f12-95dc-74ed4a62a93f

Hardware costs: $5000
Software/services: $1000
Travel: $5000
Salary: $43,500 (approx. $20/hour at 40 hours/week)

Average annual salary for Community Relations Managers in his area is $99,000 as of July 26, 2022, but the range typically falls between $82,150 and $119,916. (Source: salary.com)

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[Would you like custom spawn points or ability to spawn in at last location?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2f347730-fec6-11ec-8f44-ef1722f0509f)

## Summary

instead of spawning only in genesis plaza you can spawn where ever you set it to.


## Abstract

Myself and alot of the community would like to spawn in different locations aside genesis plaza. I think it would be great to be able to spawn at any place on the map.


## Motivation

Always spawning in genesis plaza can get rather boring and sometimes it would be nice to be able to spawn else where. I imagine having a house on a parcel and being able to spawn there when i load the client so it feels you load into your home within Decentraland. Or even spawn at a favourite location.


## Specification

the developers of DCL could impliment this feature


## Conclusion

In conclusion i believe that this feature is much needed and feel it can be implimented easily to the decentraland client.

How do you make people participate in the DAO voting system?

Certainly not by making them feel like they have no chance of moving the needle in the first place.

At the same time, you can't take away voting power from people who have invested early on and are now considered small whales, to make the system fairer. So what do you do?

Well, since name NFT owners have passed a vote to get voting points and landowners have voting power privileges - Why do wearables owners not have that?

The only reason that I can think of is that future L2 wearables minted on MATIC may be minted for a very low cost per NFT so those would not be a great measure of how invested their owners are in the game. This would incentivize spam wearables just to get VP. So that is out of the question, - for now. Future L2 MATIC wearables will not be included in this initiative.

But ETH Layer 1 wearables have a fixed supply (except for a few rewards still outstanding) and are well distributed across the community. Every wearable you own today is an L1 wearable.

What if owning those would give you additional voting power?

After all most of those were purchased, like names and lands. And those that were received as rewards prove active participation in the game and that should be worth something.

Yes, certain larger entities will gain some additional VP, too. But I believe the wider distribution of VP among the regular folks in Decentraland would increase the will to participate in the DAO and would better represent how invested someone is in the metaverse.

I would suggest to first decide if we want that and then have a second poll on how to tier the system based on the rarity category of the items.

What do you think? Do you want more voting power for your L1 wearables?

- YES, VP for my L1 wearables
- NO, no VP for my L1 wearables

## Abstract

Nearly three months ago, we launched a website to create a gallery feed of all properties available to rent across major metaverses such as Decentraland.

The project – called https://rentparcel.io/ – received a great response so far - 70+ property posts, 2k+ post views in 20+ countries despite very little marketing. We were also able to successfully connect multiple tenants with landlords and were even instrumental in facilitating rentals worth hundreds of dollars!

We are now requesting your support to turn this project into a full-fledged peer-to-peer marketplace in order to make Decentraland super accessible to the average person for renting, advertising, hosting events, etc.

Based on our current website, land owners would submit their property posts along with a price and contact, and anyone interested would reach out to them and work the rental details out. We witnessed multiple potential tenants reaching out to us to learn more about the rental process as our website helped them connect with land owners. However, we also soon learned that Decentraland remains largely inaccessible to the average person looking to advertise, market their products, or celebrate/host events on it.

While we were able to make the lands more discoverable through our platform, the process of actually using the land remains much more complicated. Decentraland allows land owners to grant temporary edit permissions to another user for their land (https://docs.decentraland.org/market/land-manager/#give-permissions) but in order for the tenants to work with it, they need to be well-versed with deploying code to build something in DCL. The problem is that in many cases the tenants don’t really need these permissions and just want to connect and work with the land owner on how they plan to use the land.

Think of the following major use cases for example:

1.  A production company wants to promote their upcoming film on someone’s land, they would like to directly ask the land owner to put up a poster or some other graphic on a particular asset on the land, for instance, a billboard. Or basically, any other company looking to advertise or market their product’s info on someone’s land.
2.  A family wants to celebrate a birthday party or some other similar event in DCL, they want to use an existing parcel/estate without any changes and all they require is the land owner’s help to let them host the event.

Neither of these above cases require the involvement of a smart contract or any sort of transfer of ownership or other permissions, and the whole process can be worked out simply by connecting and communicating with potential tenants. And so, RentParcel will build a platform that will make it extremely simple to connect with land owners for anyone who’s trying to utilize Decentraland but doesn’t have any advanced knowledge of crypto, nfts, or the metaverse.

How is this happening currently?

Currently, if potential customers want to connect with land owners they do it largely through Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and other social media sources, which is mostly unorganized. There are also metaverse real estate agents and advertising firms that act as middlemen or brokers for facilitating ‘rentals’. Our vision is to democratize access to Decentraland land and create a level playing field in terms of opportunities for land owners. By building a peer-to-peer marketplace, we would be able to have a single dedicated space where anyone can connect with DCL land owners, use their land, leave reviews, and just help make the entire process more open, accessible, and transparent.


## Specification

RentParcel will streamline the process of using someone’s land - we plan to model our website in the following manner:

1.  For land owners: Land owners would go to our website and create a post for their property (wallet integration will not be mandatory) which will also include the price per day for using their land and the availability.

2.  For customers (any person, entity, or organisation) looking to use DCL land for whatever their need is - renting, marketing, events, etc., would then browse through this website and select their property of interest and duration (for which they intend to use the land), and they will then request to communicate directly with the land owner.

The land owner will then get a notification that someone is interested in their land and it will be up to them to accept/reject the invite to initiate the conversation. Once the details such as price, duration, etc are finalized, RentParcel will let the land owner set a price and duration which would be then sent to the tenant customer to accept. The exact reason for using the land will be something that will be worked out between the two parties.

In addition, we will also include features that can be found on popularly existing marketplace like websites such as leaving reviews/ratings both for landlords and customers, searching, filtering on price, land type, size, etc.

We plan to use the requested funds for the following:

1.  Accelerating the development of the project and creating informational content - we will hire more developers to expedite the completion of the project. We’ll also retain video editors to create educational content for both land owners and tenants on how to go about using space in DCL for hosting events or advertising.
2.  Marketing - We will also retain an experienced and dedicated marketing personnel who would oversee search engine optimisation (SEO), design our online ads strategy, and handle social media engagement to help increase customer traction for the land owners.
3.  Establishing Partnerships - We are currently focussed more on Decentraland and will work to partner with companies trying to bring experiences or replicating real world events in DCL by persuading them to use our platform so that land owners are benefited.

15364,15364,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Enable .vrm support for Decentraland models,"> by 0x8b257b97c0e07e527b073b6513ba8ea659279b61 (Morph)

### .vrm support for DCL avatars

### What

VRM is the current leading model format for VR social applications & games. It's an extended wrapper class around .glbs/gltf that can add additional complexity like jiggle bones, expressions and VR player mapping.

### How

Decentraland's human skeleton model is an exact match to the VRM-humanoid model, making this process feasible. We would not need to add jiggle bones or expressions, they are optional; The VR player mapping can be done in the .glb -> .vrm conversion thanks to this already matching bone structure. A unity plugin, uniVRM, does this automatically already - we would need to implement this functionality in a pipeline that can automate this process.

### Why

An API that can export the .vrm of a player would be incredibly useful, not only for the upcoming VR Client, but also for interoperability with all VR and non-VR games. The .vrm model is easily imported to external games, allowing our avatars to travel 'across the metaverse' without custom implementations and rigging.

This API should be locked so you can only export your current character, ensuring that you can only bring your current avatar into other games. This process would require an eth sign on API request to ensure the user has ownership, enabling DCL to remain in control of the ownership and creator rights.

### Conclusion

Overall, I think this would be a powerful step forward for interoperability as well as avatar/wearable ownership, enabling a 'one-click' button to import DCL characters into other games. I already use my 'morphbot' avatar on both twitch and VRChat thanks to this process, but an automated API would unlock this for all users and developers.

Keen to hear thoughts and would love to hear the VR team's feedback on whether this is being explored currently, the M3 org has also expressed interest in this, as it would enable import of DCL avatars to the webaverse's upcoming MMO.

- Implement an API that can generate, cache, and export a user's current model as .vrm
- Do not implement, not useful
- Unsure of feasibility to run and maintain
- Invalid question/options

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

The aim is to build a fully functional integration between the [MetaMundo](https://metamundo.co/) marketplace and Decentraland to enable new and existing 3D creators to drive user adoption and engagement in Decentraland by populating it more efficiently with 3D assets. This will benefit 3D creators, landowners and Decentraland users altogether.

## Description

There is a huge opportunity to improve monthly active users with an active inflow of high quality scenes. Making sure there is more to do and to see, is possible by helping 3D creators get their scenes into Decentraland with less friction, enabling more building. If Decentraland is able to attract more new users by more easily deploying new experiences, it will strengthen it’s position as one of the leading platforms in the metaverse.

MetaMundo recently launched as a dedicated 3D NFT marketplace for metaverse scenes and assets. Our aim is to onboard our existing network of 16,000 plus high quality and experienced 3D modelers, architects and designers to help build experiences, scenes and assets for the metaverse. This network comes from the team and their previous companies. MetaMundo's vision is to remove the major inefficiencies for creating metaverse scenes and assets and ​​make it very easy for creators to publish engaging content ready to use in Decentraland through their 3D model conversion and optimisation pipelines delivered to the DCL end user with just a few clicks.

Our intention is to build a seamless integration between the MetaMundo marketplace and the Decentraland SDK so that 3D scene and asset collectors can be easily deployed to their land without friction. The integration will bring a high quality 3D NFT marketplace on board as a partner organization to easily supply scenes to Decentraland and drive traffic, engagement and retention. Our mission with this is to help to populate Decentraland with engaging content at a much faster rate and enable artists to list and sell their creations on a much larger scale. The MetaMundo platform integration will also function as an active onramp for new 3D artists into Decentraland.

## Specification

To develop a seamless deployment solution, it’s important to describe and breakdown how MetaMundo supports 3D creators to optimize and mint their models into 3D NFTs optimized for Decentraland. The first two parts of the process are focused on model processing and configuration. With the artwork and the interactions configured, the final part of the process is to integrate assets into Decentraland via the Builder. We’re planning to deliver a seamless experience by passing all the configurations and artwork defined prior to import directly into a user’s Scene, ready to deploy to their LAND.

We will start with integrating the MetaMundo marketplace with DCL via API to work directly with the Builder and DCL SDK. This will enable us to automate all the steps that are currently required from the user, like importing and configuration, and turn this into a single, more streamlined flow directly from the MetaMundo marketplace.

Our servers we will store a safe backup of all the files acquired by the user. These servers will help us configure the files in the cloud enabling easier deployment of the data defined from the MetaMundo platform. Data will be sent between the server, the client and marketplace using traditional data requisition and JSON data transfer for complex data, and sensitive content will be secured under wallet validation using Web3 standards.

We plan to develop a library of interactions and ready-to-use features and plug-ins, built entirely in Typescript/Javascript to make it easier to interact with the DCL SDK. This way we can abstract part of the development work, and this layer will ensure we automate manual processes like positioning and configuring sub systems from the NFT. We’ll create a complete building system using cloud infrastructure with CI to ensure we can automatically test, run and iterate with assets under development.

Our goal is to automate the model processing pipeline. It will go from high-fidelity 3D file to a DCL optimized version, we will create plugins for leading 3D software (Python scripts will be adapted for each software) that will have a faster iteration process, along with a complete CI system helping artists to validate their 3D work in the Decentraland environment without any friction (enabling a preview build easily from Blender and 3ds Max).

Here are a few examples of interactive scenes by popular artists like Dutchtide, LuisFern5 and Mila Lolli that MetaMundo has helped optimize for use in Decentraland:

## Roadmap and milestones

**TS/JS Decentraland Abstraction Library (1 Month)** The library will have a lot of abstractions and automations to make it faster and easier to include interactions, features and to integrate with the DCL SDK.

**DCL Builder Integrations (3/4 Weeks)** This tool will be a smart bridge to connect our client and server sides with the Builder to automate importing and configuring steps. This will require a robust API to be able to directly integrate with Decentraland internal systems.

**DCL Emulation System (1 Month)** This step will emulate Decentraland using the native SDK and validate requirements to make sure it will be running in the best way possible. It will also make it possible to iterate faster by enabling everything to be tested without the need of manual export and import in the builder.

**3D File Conversion Pipeline (3/4 weeks)** Development of an 3D file conversion pipeline that will take master .FBX, .USD, or .OBJ files from creators and convert these files and optimize it into a DCL friendly .GLB file format ready to use immediately within DCL. This conversion pipeline will consider limitations such as size, poly count, materials, DCL Colliders, dimensions, land size constraints and components that are not supported in DCL.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

The team behind Decentraland’s DAO-funded VR client is seeking a grant for continued development and expansion of VR support for Decentraland. The proposed scope in this grant expands the current VR client to include native Android support so that devices such as the Quest 2 can be supported without the need to connect to a PC. We also seek to enhance the VR client to bring more functionality by converting more keyboard/mouse interactions to VR controller interactions and implementing a unique hand/controller-based UI that is more suitable for a VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR.

## Description

### Background

In December 2021, the community voted to approve a Decentraland DAO [grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=088fc210-5e26-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) that launched one of the first significant VR efforts to the Decentraland ecosystem.

Read the previous grant proposal [here.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=088fc210-5e26-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)

That grant proposal covered both the development of Byldr to support creating content for Decentraland as well as a viewer for users to experience Decentraland in VR.
That grant proposal specified that the VR viewer was not the primary focus of the grant, and the original intention of the proposed approach was to integrate the viewer with Byldr. However, after starting work on the project, the team quickly realized that Decentraland would better benefit from a separate, open source VR client and that the addition of a VR client would be an enormous benefit for Decentraland. Therefore, the team spent significantly more effort on the VR client portion of that grant than originally planned for and have since received remarkably positive engagement and enthusiasm from the Decentraland community.

Under the previous grant, the team was able to successfully port Decentraland to run on PC-based VR devices (SteamVR headsets, Quest via PC link, Windows Mixed Reality, and other PCVR headsets) and began to convert most 2D UI elements and interacts to operate in 3D space within the VR experience.

### Decentraland VR support to run natively on Quest

The team spent significant time investigating porting Decentraland VR to run natively on android in order to support devices such as the Quest 2, without the need to connect the headset to a PC. After much investigation and attempts, the team learned that the Decentraland architecture would require significant effort to get the Decentraland kernel (the core component of Decentraland that handles scene state) to run on an Android-based VR headset. The team proposes to tackle this challenge in this grant in order to build a native Quest Decentraland VR client. This will significantly reduce the difficulty and cost of accessing Decentraland VR and make Decentraland a true, portable immersive experience for the masses.

### Continued development of Decentraland VR

Decentraland’s in-world interactions are primarily built around PC-based inputs such as keyboard and mouse. While the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do.

The team seeks to build upon the previous VR client effort by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world! We would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.


## Specification

### Decentraland Native Quest Support.

The team previously explored multiple pathways for native Quest support. Although the team was able to successfully achieve a Quest port of the Decentraland renderer, without the kernel no content would load into the scene. A full port to run Decentraland VR on Quest would require that the Decentraland kernel is also ported. Pathways explored included running the kernel on a PC and connecting it to the headset, running the kernel remotely, and running the kernel on the VR headset. The preferred pathway is for the kernel to run directly on the headset so that a PC is not required. The team’s proposed approach is to launch the kernel within an in-app container or to launch a backgrounded on-device server. Once the kernel is running, then the Decentraland renderer will be able to load content from the kernel and provide a functional experience. The team will then investigate and tackle any potential android-related incompatibilities with Decentraland, providing robust Quest support. The team intends to work closely with Decentraland foundation for publishing the Decentraland VR application and for any kernel- and renderer-related core contributions as part of the port to Android.

### Decentraland VR continued development and improvements.

As mentioned in the description, the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, however there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do. For any UI elements that only appear on the 2D PC screen, such as dialogue text and some pop-up messages, the team will bring these items into 3D space, and where appropriate, ensure that they are located in the context of their associated content (e.g., a pop-up text will appear next to the item that spawned the pop-up.) There are also some in-world games and custom experiences that rely on keyboard input (e.g., “press E” or “Press F” to do to shoot a ball.) Although it will be difficult to universally convert all custom keyboard functionality to VR – the team proposes to standardize inputs to VR controller buttons and investigate any logic that can map keyboard keys to controller buttons, depending on context. The team will also implement a unique UI that is more suitable for a VR client. This UI will involve being attached to one or both controllers, allowing for convenient, nested menu options that are easily accessible within VR.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Filmrare has established a stream of content that has brought people together to watch movies in a metaverse movie theater that behaves a lot like real-world cinemas. Our core philosophy/principle has been to always acquire rights to screen content. This might be slow but it ensures that the creator/rights owners are onboarded to DCL, are compensated for their work, and spread awareness. We have spent hours building relationships with independent filmmakers and rights owners. We don't want to stop here and make this effort a scalable/profitable venture so that it's recognized as a genuine venue to consume content. This grant will keep us alive until we turn profitable.


## Grant size

60,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f

## Description

The first thing we did to expand was to partner with projects that align with our philosophy. Hence, we moved into SciArtLab where we have scaled into a cineplex with 6 floors including 3 floors with movie screens. SciArtLab has been a major support in marketing our vision to fellow DCL players. Check out the district http://district.sciartlab.com/

We are also building partnerships with rights owners from the entertainment industry. Some of the people that we have acquired from are

1.  Wave Films - http://wave-films.com/

2.  IndieRights -https://www.indierights.com/

3.  NewGen Entertainment - https://www.newgenentertainment.it/

4.  Josh Stifter - https://twitter.com/joshstifter

5.  Bitjoin Studios -https://twitter.com/bitjoin

New partners in the pipeline

1.  GlobalFlix - https://www.globalflix.tv/globalflix-studios

2.  TVCO - https://www.tvco.eu/

3.  Minerva Pictures - https://www.minervapicturesinternational.com/

4.  Underground Film Festival - https://twitter.com/Underground_FF

As mentioned before we acquire rights to screen the film. This effort is making two important changes

1.  We're establishing a sanitized process to become the default movie theater in DCL

2.  We're establishing a new rights category never used before called ""Meta Rights"" where we pick the rights to screen content for a limited number of runs during a period by paying an acquisition fee. This will become a standard going forward in the industry.

The process to pick titles: Since, we handpick content we have a lengthy conversation with the rights owner where we explain metaverse, Decentraland, and what a movie theater looks like in DCL. We invite them for a private screening to experience it. We educate them about the future of metaverse, VR, and crypto. We also push to use the ""Meta Rights"" that don't conflict with existing rights. We too learn about the industry's biases and prejudices making us to better navigate the conversation.

The process to screen: We have a manual process to screen the movie at a particular time and we focus our effort during the UTC evenings when the activity is the highest. Our shows usually start at 6 PM UTC. We manually screen the films that are delivered to the screen, we also are working on a DRM tech to prevent screen capture during the show to prevent bootlegging.

The process to market: We are hyperfocused on DCL as our prime platform. We spend time in DCL discord promoting the events that we create on the event page. We also have a growing community in SciArtLab where we have a Filmrare channel and do Twitter Spaces at least once a month. We are building https://filmrare.com and starting work on SEO.

The process to monetize: We aim to be self-sustainable in 6 months. Our monetization is split into these 3 categories

1.  Wearable Access: We have Theater 1 specifically allowing access through buying a wearable that gives you lifetime access. Our first wearable is already live
    https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x2371015f90f14b64f79e280577a7152a4797ff14/items/0

2.  Blue-chip NFT project access - We are planning to market to blue-chip NFT projects and sell early access wearables to members to leverage the community.

3.  Space rental - We're talking to potential entertainment/creative companies/Projects that are looking to have a metaverse presence and allow them to rent space in Filmrare. We have growing foot traffic of about 1000-1500 players per week already.


## Specification

Our Filmrare scene is already live at 2,55. Our monthly tasks and the cost associated are below

1.  Founder Salary - $1500
2.  Metaverse movie projectionist salary - $750
3.  Rental - $1200

15371,15371,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,New Wearable Collections Need Approval from the DAO before being minted,"> by 0xb5cde1c5b905892cf0873cc43fddb56c1738888f (Rednitrous18)

The new Wearable builder has been announced and with it the details for how collections get approved and minted. https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/
Early on in the discussion of the wearable builder the Decentraland foundation said the new collections would go through a committee and a DAO vote before being able to be minted. This was to make sure the Wearables were compatible and able to work in world as well as having a quality control to make sure the collection was wanted in world ny the community.

Now they have removed the DAO Vote from the process.
Without a vote by the community the ecosystem will be flooded by collections of wearables. Some issues that could arise from a lack of quality control and moderation:

*   Low effort wearables (single image on a plane t-shirt)
*   wearables with no community interest
*   Major drop in value for all wearables
*   flooded marketplace with low demand

Artist should be able to express their creativity and fashion without destroying or disrupting the ecosystem. There also should be interest for new collections and not just collections being minted because one person wants a shirt or other wearable.
Fees for minting a collection can only do so much for moderation. If anything it only prices out artist.

So I call for a vote on whether or not new wearable collections should have a DAO vote before being minted.

Happy to hear feedback or other ideas on the forum as there is always more ways to solve an issue.

- Yes, needs Approval
- No, no Approval

Now, i am two months in Decentraland and i have to scroll and sometimes my items don't load or they are still loading.. Can we please have a saved outfits section where we can have save up to 10 outfits and load them up.. There are times when i am making my outfit and in the middle of making it, it resets back to normal which can be frustrating for some..

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Nexus Market is a 279-parcel district at -1,51. We plan to offer reasonable land lease options for big and small companies and creators and shared event space for any tenant to use.

We commissioned an award-winning architect to create a wonderful design concept for the district. We have a strategic relationship with Parcel, a renowned metaverse real estate marketplace, to help present the district to major brands. LEDY Inc. an experienced metaverse real estate developer will design and build shared spaces within the district.

With a DAO grant, we can pay skilled modelers and developers to build a minimum viable version of the district, and create the brand awareness needed to attract new companies and creators to Decentraland.

## Description

Nexus Market District was formed in 2018 as the Central Marketplace. The district has 279 parcels thanks to MANA donations from 61 contributors. Since then, lack of capital has been a big hurdle for Nexus to deliver on its vision. Efforts to get 3d modelers and programmers to work for free failed. Skilled professionals want to be paid.

Recently, the team commissioned conceptual designs and an urban plan for the district, and the results have been amazing. With grant funds, we can pay talented architects, modelers, and developers to complete and deploy this design.

We can create a new kind of commerce and entertainment district with cost-effective leasing options for any company or creator who doesn't want to buy land. By lowering the friction to set up a presence in Decentraland we plan to attract new companies and creators, and their followers, who might not come here otherwise.

The Nexus project is also partnering with [Parcel](https://parcel.so), the premier metaverse land marketplace, creator directory, and education platform, to present leasing opportunities to potential clients, including well-known companies and brands.

**Cohesive Design and Planning**

The district design unites shops, galleries, anchor presences, a shared event space, and an open market plaza in a cohesive architectural whole. The initial design concept shows that Nexus can become a spectacular addition to Decentraland, attracting new brands, businesses, and players.

![Nexus Crystal City concept](https://wonderzone.io/img/nexus/NexusCrystalConcept.png ""Nexus Crystal City concept"")

The large front area is a shared event space where events can be run by any Nexus tenant. It can be configured as a stage for concerts, or as a large screen viewing area for films and video streams.

The expansive corner quadrants are open to larger companies who want to house their HQ or other custom-built structures in Nexus. These are some of the anchors that should attract new attendees to the district, and benefit from the traffic brought in by other nearby tenants.

The dramatic ""Crystal City"" structure will become the main Nexus landmark. It's also practical. The larger structures can house multiple shops, galleries, and other leasable spaces.

We want to bring together world-class design and architecture, fun interactivity, real-world retail brands, and the Decentraland creator community. The resulting district and the attention it will garner could help cement Decentraland’s position as the leading metaverse platform, and demonstrate new use cases and experiences for the future.

**Previous Work**

The team members are well positioned to deliver. They have already deployed a number of impressive builds in Decentraland.

With the WonderZone team, Rob Dixon designed and created the [WonderZone Amusement Park](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-50%2C51) and the ever-popular WonderMine game.

In addition, [LEDY](https://ledy.io) has already built:

*   The [New Scirocco Resort](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-38%2C-105) from their [Extraverse](https://www.extraverse.xyz/) collection. Sold for 42 Eth.
*   The second resort NFT, [Grand Aurelia](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54).
*   The [607 Beverly Hills Metahouse](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a for-sale $9.4M mansion.
*   The [Ferrari 90210 home](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a real-world $17M home.


## Specification

This grant will be used to fund four aspects of development:

1.  **Refine architectural design, urban planning, and layout.** Starting from the initial concept, we’ll add details regarding urban planning and a unified district map for the district. This will also include design style guidelines for modelers who will create individual structures on the map.

2.  **Build and deploy core structures and shared spaces.** This will include the central Crystal City, the plaza and event space, and the paths and common areas between the leasable lands. LEDY works with a network of talented modelers and can source the best ones to deliver the buildings, landscaping, and other elements we need.

3.  **Build interactive experiences.** We will pay developers to create unique interactive experiences in the district, so every visit is entertaining. One core experience is the convertible event space that can shift from an open music stage to a covered film theater. Other work involves support for easily setting up and configuring shops, gallery spaces, or marketplace booths for creators.

4.  **Brand awareness and public relations.** Building upon branding work being done with Parcel, we will involve a top PR agency to create awareness of Nexus and Decentraland in major media publications. This can attract more companies who are interested in leasing areas within Nexus, and by extension bring new players with them. LEDY’s recent work deploying real estate models in Decentraland to support luxury home sales, amplified by public relations campaigns, got them coverage on TV news and multiple real-world publications.

This grant alone is not enough to build out the entire district plus all the interactive experiences and commerce infrastructure we envision. We're starting with a relatively small grant so we can show positive results in the first 6 months. Then if there's a need for a future grant we'll have a solid track record of achievement first. Of course, we hope that after 6 months we'll lease many spaces in Nexus, making future grants unnecessary.

**Benefits to the Decentraland Community**

This project could provide many benefits for the community:

*   The leasing model allows those who can’t afford land to set up their own shop, gallery, or other space. It can help **alleviate concerns about land scarcity pricing people out**. Leasable areas within Nexus can be as small as 1x2 parcels, with low leasing rates.

*   Our tenants share the common event space. It's more cost-effective for a company to build a Decentraland presence without having to buy extra parcels to build their own arena or theater. This might **attract companies that wouldn't come to Decentraland otherwise**.

*   New companies mean **new work for creators who can help them build out their presence**. We are working with Parcel’s Creatorverse program to find creators in the community who want to build out shops, galleries, and other spaces for tenants, and get paid for it.

*   **The more tenants in the district, the more everyone benefits**. We plan on a mix of large anchor presences, plus medium-sized and smaller spaces. Like a thriving mall, people might come to see one space, then be intrigued and investigate the whole district, discovering new creators and experiences as they go.

*   We want to make it **fun to visit Nexus every day**. We'll use learnings from other projects to build surprises, flexible features, frequent events, and even game-like features to keep things interesting.

15379,15379,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should Wearables Including Guns Be Allowed?,"> by 0xca5b437dbc3c7f441f99c698d4b1fe1aa0599346 (MetaParty)

Should Guns/Knifes attached to wearables be accepted. Guns and knifes are very common in some of the most popular games of all time such as GTA, Call Of Duty, Battlefield and many more. Guns can add possible nostalgia to games. For example creating a golden gun brings back memories of grinding on Cod for a cold camo.

Yes there are people who have experienced trauma from guns. But due to their popularity in video games they are detached  from the trauma they have caused. This does not mean that we forget tragedy's that have occurred around the world but instead it means that we associate guns with video games.

MetaParty have already had a wearable approved and published named the Meta Soldier. The wearable includes a detailed black pistol attached to the avatars hand. This wearable was approved within 10 days.  We have sold over 200 of theses wearables to the DCL community.

https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0xe65fcdb82f516a2361e4e9af9897fd53ef796bb5/items/0

Recently we have submitted another wearable named the Exo Soldier. This wearable includes two golden pistols with suppressors (inspired by Call Of Duty). After 14 days of the wearable being under review we received a reply from a curator stating that wearables with guns are being discussed, as they may fall under the violent content category.

https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0xe65fcdb82f516a2361e4e9af9897fd53ef796bb5/items/0

Furthermore if guns are now classed as violent content then will all knifes be classed as violent content and also need to be changed. I understand the two are different but depending on where you are in the world swords/knifes can be a lot more commonly used in violent crimes then guns.

Decentraland is a global platform with users speaking a variety of different languages. Decentraland Names in their current form do not allow for alternative languages such as Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi etc. The current restrictions are ; they may not exceed 15 characters, contain spaces, or include any non-alphanumeric characters. If Decentraland is to be adopted, inclusivity of all languages seems logical.

(Decentraland Names leverage ENS as Subdomains of parent domain, dcl.eth. ENS Clubs have formed such as Arabic 999 Club & 999 CN Club, indicating clear demand for alternative languages.)

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

I am currently a licensed Realtor in Connecticut and New York, USA. As I learn about real estate IRL and virtually, I know the Metaverse is going to be the future.  I want to use the grant to spread knowledge. I will share on my many platforms, what I am doing in Crypto Real Estate and how important it is to invest in Decentraland and the Metaverse while it is still early and on the forefront of technology. We can build whatever we want on Decentraland. I want to share that with others and help Decentraland grow!


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xC9EA520f77CecDEF90B47A8DAdD739bbeA4d73cb

## Description

This project deserves funding because I intend to educate the average person how beneficial it would be to start investing in Crypto Real Estate-Primarily in Decentraland because of its potential. Not only can you play on Decentraland but you can build wealth, where you might not be able to afford to build wealth IRL, there is nothing stopping anyone from investing in themselves and virtual land on Decentraland.

I will create easy processes to buy, sell, trade and even rent on Decentraland. Part of the reason people hesitate into jumping into new technology is that they are uneducated. My platforms will be happy to educate and welcome any questions for new and experienced crypto real estate investors.

I will donate proceeds from the grant into giveaways to gather new followers and users to the platform because everyone loves airdrops and giveaways!


## Specification

I will be posting on my Tiktok, YouTube, Clash, IG Reels and FB Reels and using Analytics and SEO to drive organic traffic to the Decentraland platform.


## Personnel

At this time I will be the sole person on the project, however, I am open to finding the right fit to help partner some of the work with someone familiar with the Decentraland platform.


## Roadmap and milestones

3 month time table:

Month 1
\-Advertise on tiktok and youtube, telegrams and discords
\-Research and create video content to focus the niche.
\-Start educating and giving away Decentraland, especially since we are low right now it will be really great to showcase the gains from the dip!
\-Start buying Decentraland

Month 2
\-Advertise on tiktok and youtube, telegrams and discords
\-Show everyone how to make passive income by renting out spaces.
\-Start Flipping Land-educating on how to flip

## Abstract

This proposal is to ask the DAO funding to **organize, participate, and list Decentraland as sponsor and co-organizer of a web3 journalism hackathon** to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina in August 2022 in the context of the [Media Party](https://www.mediaparty.info/english), a media and technology conference. The plan includes partnering with [ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/) (International Center for Journalism), hosting talks, and organizing a web3 journalism hackathon with prizes for winners. **We would like to invite as speakers and mentors, members from the Decentraland community to talk about the possibilities the metaverse and DAOs as organizational structures could provide to journalists and independent media.**

## Description

A two-day hackathon hosted and sponsored by ICFJ and the Decentraland DAO at [Hacks/Hackers’](https://www.hackshackers.com/) Media Party in Buenos Aires 2022. The activity will be focused on the possibilities that the Web3 ecosystem (Tools, communities, funding, and incentives) could provide to journalists and independent media projects. Some topics we are planning to address:

*   Metaverse journalism
*   Media DAOs
*   Decentralized tools for journalists
*   Token Funding
*   Token-gated content
*   Token incentives for collaborators

The plan is to invite 5 speakers that will also serve as mentors on the Hackathon, that could talk about all these topics. Potential candidates are:

*   Laurent Bainier - [20mint.fr](https://20mint.xyz/) Web3 project from the french magazine 20minutes
*   KevinOnEarth - [Decentraland Report](https://xpand.gg/community/the-decentraland-report)
*   Reporters without borders - [Uncensored Library Project](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en) ([Grant funded](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=efddde80-bf1b-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4) by Decentraland DAO)
*   [Tinshui Yeung](https://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/tinshui-yeung) - ICFJ Fellow researching web3 journalism
*   Know someone who is doing cool stuff around web3, metaverses, and journalism? Let us know in the comments!

### Why this event?

Hosting a hackathon in the context of the Media Party is natural since Buenos Aires is going through a Crypto Revolution, has a strong community, and is becoming one of the leading crypto capitals in the world. Projects like Proof of Humanity, Kleros, POAP, Decentraland, OpenZeppelin, HardHat, and Muun all have roots in Buenos Aires. Furthermore, Media Party has been the most innovative forum for journalism and technology discussions in LATAM for the last 10 years. Like the web3 movement, Media Party is a community-first event, focused and organized by independent members, and is also a hands-on conference where people come to learn by doing and interacting with others.

Some of the previous and current sponsors of the Media Party have been: Mozilla Foundation, Meta, Google, ICFJ, Open Knowledge Foundation, and Omidyar Network. We believe that listing Decentraland as a sponsor of the event could raise awareness about the project to an audience (Journalists and media people) who talk about the metaverse but never really experienced it.

### Why the Decentraland DAO?

Let's face it, journalists talk a lot about the Metaverse but most of them never experienced it. We would like to put this project right in front of them, with all the complexities and potential that an open-source, community ran project have. It is also interesting since Meta is going to be sponsoring the event and they have a lot of journalist-related projects. We want to show that there is another way of thinking about the internet and how the information flows. And lastly, we believe it would be a nice place to showcase the Community Grants program to content creators and media outlets from all over the world.


## Specification

The total cost of this event, including travel expenses (Flights & hotel), production costs, GMF (Goodies, merch, and food), and hackathon winner prizes is estimated at $40k. **Since we would be partnering with ICFJ, they will provide $20k and the Decentraland community would provide the other $20k**

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Atlas Corporation proposes to develop an open source dApp which is used to determine the total amount of primary and secondary sales for each L2 wearable, wearable collection, and creator.

At the beginning of September, the DAO voted to redirect the 2.5% royalty fees from secondary wearables sales to the creators of the wearables. This grant proposal builds on the previously 'passed' poll to bring it to fruition.

Currently, the DAO Committee does not have a tool to calculate royalties due to each creator and the DAO dApps team is still in the planning and hiring phase. The royalty fees due to creators currently reside in the DAO committee wallet and should be redistributed to creators when the accounts payable is calculated.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xe64581f067cfdce58657e3c0f58175e638c30f2b

## Description

The scope of this project is the development of a tool that allows the user to view all primary and secondary sales per item, per collection. ""Primary sales"" are indicated by the consumer minting the wearable through the store contract, and originates from the null address. “Secondary sales” are sales that have occurred on the Decentraland Marketplace, either via direct listing from the creator or listing by a consumer.

Any user is able to access the dApp and view data by either Wearable Creator, Wearable Collection, or Wearable Item. Data is presented in an intuitive way such that selecting an item, collection, or creator results in a table with a complete list of all primary and  secondary sales and some basic analytics about the market of that selection.

The transaction table is viewable within the app and downloadable by a user in CSV format for submission to the wearables committee.

The transaction table of primary and secondary sales transactions includes the following information:

*   Name of the wearable, collection, and creator
*   Date and time the transaction occurred
*   Addresses of the buyer and seller (or ENS address if applicable)
*   Transaction amount and currency
*   The transaction hash, with link to [Polyscan](https://polygonscan.com/)
*   The 2.5% royalty calculation for the transaction

Market Analytics:

*   Weekly sales comparison, primary and secondary
*   Graph of cumulative primary sales over time, by item and Mana
*   Graph of secondary sales, including number of items sold, average price, and volume

Additional market analytics may be added as a result of discovery sessions with wearables creators.

This application will be hosted on IPFS. We will purchase a domain, register it for 3 years, and forward it to IPFS as a convenience to users.

The application will be made open source using an MIT license and the git repo will be made public, allowing users to run the dApp locally.


## Specification

The dApp will make use of the following technologies:

*   Angular
*   Angular Material
*   Bootstrap
*   IPFS
*   The Graph
*   Decentraland Catalyst Server
*   Ethereum Naming Service

The preliminary work towards this goal surrounds the inspection of the current subgraph implementation for L2 wearables indexing. First, to confirm whats needed to extract the data from the subgraph in its current implementation. Second, to understand if there is significant value to be unlocked for the wearables creators as to justify the development of this tool for its immediate and future use, subsequently resulting in the submission, and resubmission, of this proposal.


## Personnel

Development will be led by howieDoin.dcl.eth and MorrisMustang.dcl.eth from Atlas Corporation.

howieDoin and MorrisMustang joined the Decentraland community in February this year. Their primary focuses are gathering data and creating analytics for the Decentraland ecosystem. You can check out some public examples at [Decentralandalytics App](https://app.decentralandalytics.com).

Over the course of the year, the team has realized how important some of this data is to the community at large and this grant proposal is one of our efforts towards democratizing access.

Disclosures: Atlas Corporation has not created any wearables to date and will not experience a material gain from the existence of this tool, outside of the grant funds allocated for development.


## Roadmap and milestones

Development Sprint 1:

*   Locate the data
*   Program the extraction of the data
*   Aggregate and transpose the data into its consumable form
*   Conduct discovery interviews with prominent wearable creators to arrive at user stories which will inform the design of the front end dApp.

Development Sprint 2:

*   Design and implement user interface to retrieve and render the primary and secondary sales data
*   Publish dApp to IPFS and route DNS

Background read & Context: https://maraoz.com/2022/05/04/decentraland-vision/
![](https://maraoz.com/img/decentraland-vision/expansion-small.jpg)

Let's make Decentraland more accessible! The original map of 301x301 parcels was great to bootstrap the project by generating LAND scarcity, but it’s already too small for our community. What’s worse, many LANDs are in the hands of speculators who will never deploy content to the world.

My proposed solution? Continuous LAND issuance. Every day, or every week, the protocol can auction a new LAND, and the highest bidder can spawn a new LAND at any coordinate adjacent to an already existing one. If nobody wants to bid, no LAND is created for that period. Believe it or not, this was the original scheme for LAND issuance, and how the first testnet worked. Yes, this would reduce prices for already existing LANDs, but… if only whales can buy LANDs, other metaverses will kill Decentraland and your LAND will be worthless. Let’s make Genesis City the first of many cities in Decentraland!

This is an initial poll to gather community sentiment on this (potentially sensitive) topic. If this passes, I'll work on a more detailed proposal for the continuous issuance model. If you have any questions, feedback, or you agree but you don't think the timing is right, please leave a comment!

So... would you support some sort of continuous LAND issuance?

I'm requesting we lengthen the Name Limit from 15 characters to 20
As for me and I'm sure plenty of other Artists are unable to Mint their true Artist Name with this cap.
When Joining the platform And trying to secure my name I was very disappointed To find that it was to long to Mint. I have had to make a similar name but not my true artist name because it was all that was available.
Some people have very long names. I wonder why there is a cap at all honestly what does it matter? I feel like this cap only hurts individuals & the platform as a whole. I was very close to not minting a Name at all but reluctantly I did. I would still like to have the ability to Mint my true Artist name some day so I would like the communities help/vote to change this cap. MuchLove ❤ OfficialCryptoCube 🧊

## Description

### Background

After Reading [maraoz's blog post about his vision for Decentraland](https://maraoz.com/2022/05/04/decentraland-vision/), I (frantufro) started to get interested in Decentraland's potential as an open-source metaverse.
Up until then my opinion about crypto gaming (including Decentraland) was rooted in the current state of Play-to-Earn games and their mostly speculative nature.
Our initial discussions on the topic made me realize how shortsighted I was about the potential of a platform like Decentraland. We both want to see an open-source alternative to Meta. We also know that there's a lot of work to be done to get there.
This proposal is our first step towards that vision.

### Vision

We would love to see a thriving community of Decentraland game creators enabled by an ecosystem of tools that support them. Besides the original 3D client developed by the Decentraland Foundation, we think that 2D experiences should definitely be a part of this ecosystem, and we want to take the lead in creating such tools.
The long-term vision for this project is to allow the community to easily create 2D retro games on Decentraland, with enough flexibility to support multiple types of 2D games.
To achieve this, we propose first building a prototype of an independent 2D retro client to walk around Decentraland, including scenes and some wearables.

## Specification

In order to enable the creation of 2D retro-style games we need an alternative 2D top-down Decentraland client, and that's where we want to start.

You may be wondering how it’s even possible to allow 2D games in Decentraland. [The Decentraland Protocol](https://docs.decentraland.org/content-intro/) consists of various layers. LANDs hold the scenes published by land-owners, which players can explore using the official 3d client. However, the protocol doesn’t specify what scenes are, or how the scenes are rendered. The official client is just **one** of many possible implementations. The magic of open-source and open protocols is that **anyone** can create their own client, with their own graphics and rendering. Currently, only the [3d web explorer by the Decentraland Foundation](https://play.decentraland.org/) exists, and a [VR client is being developed via a DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0). A prototype by maraoz shows [it’s possible to create an alternative isometric 3D client too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6rGeAuPcno). What we want to create is the base layer for anyone who wants to create 2d content.

![Visual Inspiration 1](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5efc0159f9a97ba05a8b2902/5f1a8cef64b347eced83456f_test-play.jpg)
![Visual Inspiration 1](https://scontent.faep24-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/274149700\_3735892699868507\_512428938455866077\_n.jpg?stp=cp0\_dst-jpg_e15\_q65\_s640x640&\_nc_cat=103\&ccb=1-7&\_nc_sid=110474&\_nc_ohc=zdQFhDucLmQAX_WjGSI&\_nc_ht=scontent.faep24-1.fna\&oh=00\_AT96mUUF0djP8ImKuLTBalVHobI8mgr7dGfJsfli72rkpA\&oe=62C136F0)

The main features for the prototype client and 2D SDK/CLI are:

1.  An avatar that supports some of the native Decentraland character customizations.
2.  A top-down 2D rendering of the existing scene contents that you can explore with your avatar (without, for now, the ability to interact with 3D content).
3.  The ability to add 2D tiles/assets to lands through a CLI. Definition of a protocol to support defining 2D scenes and assets in Decentraland.
4.  A tutorial explaining how assets and scenes can be created by the community using our SDK/CLI.
5.  Base avatar movement that would allow the player to navigate the 2D version of Decentraland.

With these features in place, we think we'll be in a good spot to start creating tools to implement gameplay on top of the 2D client.

As a byproduct of this prototype, we want to publish a Rust crate (software development package) to wrap Decentraland Catalyst's REST API. This way other Rust developers will be able to interact with Decentraland easily.

Out of scope for this prototype:

*   Scene logic (execute Javascript for 3D or 2D scene content).
*   Interaction with 3D scene content from 2D client.
*   Implementing a 2D sample game.

## Roadmap and milestones

We believe we can finish this project in 6 months.

We will use the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/) as a starting point, because we believe it will help us get to the prototype stage faster than implementing everything ourselves. Bevy is a free and open-source game engine in Rust. After the prototype is done we can evaluate if Bevy is the way to go or something different is required long-term.

The main milestones are:

1.  **JUL** Implementing catalyst-rs, a Rust crate to interact with Decentraland’s Catalyst API, focusing on data consumption for lands and avatars first (what we need for this prototype).
2.  **AUG-SEP** Implementing the automatic 3D to 2D object rendering of a single scene.
3.  **NOV** Implementing the renderer to support moving around Decentraland.
4.  **DEC-JAN** Implementing the avatar renderer with support for native wearables and basic movement.
5.  **JAN** Documentation on how players can add 2D assets to their lands with a reference scene.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Wear Essentials is an application that will offer users the ability to create their own wearables without needing to know 3D technical theory. Wear Essentials will provide an interface for users to build and publish a Decentraland wearable by adding their content to a library of pre-approved templates. The existence of this new platform will reduce barriers to entry for creators and builders in Decentraland to participate in the burgeoning world of digital asset creation, reduce the strain on the wearable-curation committee, and increase revenue back to the Decentraland DAO.

Tl;dr - A silk-screening service for Decentraland with increased revenue directed back to the DAO.

## Description

### Problem:

The current technical requirements for wearables to be approved into the Decentraland ecosystem can be daunting for new users in the space.  The Decentraland wearable creation process currently has a steep learning curve for non-technical 3D artists who want to express themselves or facilitate a brand experience. 2D artists currently are completely dependent on 3D artists to be included into the ecosystem; an inadvertent gate set up by the current wearables submission paradigm.

On the other side of the spectrum, non-3D-proficient submissions often lead to delays in the curation process as multiple rounds of submissions and back-and-forth between the curation committee can occur before a final design is honed and approved. This excessive iteration could lead to delays for brand items to be ready for events on time, but also strains the wearable-curation committee as the submission fee does not account for the time the experts ultimately spend reviewing.

### Solution:

Wear Essentials will provide a platform for aspiring wearables creators to design wearables without technical barriers. An easy to navigate user experience will allow creators to upload a 2D image and see their graphic presented on a catalog of essential wearables in real time. The solution will then manage the submission and curation process, deploy the wearables, and provide analytics with feedback about their uptake and distribution.

Upon submission to the wearables committee - an action which will be available right in the platform - the whole process of deployment and royalty management can be handled. Through use of payment splitter contracts on polygon, an allocation of creator funds raised through primary and secondary sales can be shared with the DAO.

The collection of templates can also be expanded over time in partnership with brands and organizations.

It makes it easier for creators as the platform will provide a set of guardrails to produce quality wearables. A set of template wearables - hats, shirts, sweaters, shoes - provide a foundation to ensure the end result will have the correct poly-counts and vertex weighting. Creators can then upload 2D imagery to be mapped on the templates. Users only need to make choices on template color and placement/size of the 2D image content to result in a wearable ready for submission to the committee. This opens up the whole ecosystem to 2D artists (illustrators, graphic designers, tattoo and traditional).

It reduces the burden on the DAO Wearables Committee as submissions coming direct from the platform have less for the team to review. Confident that the poly-counts and assets are templated, the focus can then be placed on the guidelines for the 2D images that users uploaded (approved content, IP-infringement issues, etc…).

It will increase revenue to the DAO in a few ways. Through the simplification of the wearables submission process, this platform may lead to an increase in submissions to the DAO. In addition, payment splitters or similar payment rails can be put in place to enforce revenue sharing of primary and secondary sales revenue directly with the DAO. Note that while the purpose of this initiative is to primarily build engagement and increase participation in the wearable creation process, we believe it does not hurt to add additional subsidies back to the DAO where possible.

Once the application is public we will release opensource to the community with a well documented guide!

## Personnel

### Who we are:

We are community devs seeking to build assets for our community. From the team that brought you the custom [Vogu Head](https://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1500169271342678019) - [DCL wearables](https://assembly.thevogu.io/) which literally [changed the game](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/879772401427177472/971157344216047616/unknown.png?width=616\&height=670)…

[Feeka Café](https://twitter.com/FeekaCafe) is a talented group of metaverse artists and creators helmed by [Malloy](https://twitter.com/AhoiMalloy) and Catabasist, who have been involved in building and bridging projects inside Decentraland. With extensive experience in 3D asset production, its members have created dozens of wearables and have worked on projects such as the Metaverse Festival ‘21, AO Metaverse and MTFW.

[Atlas Corporation](https://twitter.com/AtlasCorp_dcl) is a somewhat mysterious team of web3 innovation developers who call Decentraland their home. Atlas Corporation has worked on initiatives directly interfacing with the Decentraland wearables contract and has deep experience [with analytics related to Decentraland wearables and assets](http://wearables.atlascorp.io).

[Tim Phelan](https://www.timphelan.net/) is an independent designer that bridges the gap between product design and branding. With his flair for image making, terrible puns and enhanced user experiences, it is no wonder that Decentraland has become his second home.


## Roadmap and milestones

### Our approach will consist of:

*   A strong UX/UI design concepting stage
*   A sprint period to combine 3D assets with the UX/UI and prepare assets for development.
*   Contract and back end development to innovate bridging between these elements

### Fund Allocation:

#### Art and Asset Creation

*   Platform branding and design
*   Platform user experience design
*   First wave of ‘Wear Essentials’ 3d asset templates
*   Promotional and educational materials

#### Development

*   Scrum master / project management

I was looking at the prices for LANDs and then I took a look at the map. Currently, the Sandbox has more parcels of LAND then Decentraland and I think that adding 10,000 more parcels may draw more people to the game. Personally 300,000 MANA on average is pretty expensive now that we are at around $5 so this should get the prices down a bit. We can make 1,000 if 10,000 is too much.

- Make 10,000  more parcels of LAND and auction it
- Make 1,000 more parcels of LAND and auction it
- Keep the LAND market and map how it is

## NFT Collections Description

In the spirit of pushing forward the narrative of web3 interoperability & importance of on-chain NFTs, we have created the OnChainChain.  The OnChainChain is a whimsical high end piece of metaverse fashion that exemplifies the owner’s understanding of these important fundamental constructs.  A wide variety of chains, totems & accessories designed by Miguelgarest result in unique & prominent wearable chains.

OnChainChains are standalone pieces of art that also provide the collector with the ability to wear it across multiple NFTs & platforms.  The ability to wear the same OnChainChain everywhere allows the user to be recognizable even while changing avatars across the metaverse.

## Intellectual Property

I'm not sure the above smart contract address is correct but i'm sure i can find the correct information if not.  This was a project we launched on artblocks if you need any formal verification i can ask them and it will be no problem. https://www.artblocks.io/project/283


## Motivation

We built the OnChainChain with the intention of building it out to become a fully onchain interoperable wearable to be worn across many virtual worlds.  Currently the owners of the chains are using them in various capacities across several different projects and platforms but there is a very large demand for the wearable chains to be compatible in decentraland, so any help would be appreciated by myself and the community.

Interoperability is one of the key pillars of web3, in that spirit I would like to propose that Decentraland accepts ENS names (for example ""eibriel.eth"") alongside the current DCL names (for example ""eibriel.dcl.eth"").

To minimize the impact on DCL names value:

*   ENS names should display the "".eth"" ending

This should not take too much resources from the development team, since DCL names already are ENS names, and I suspect a good chunk of code can be adapted.

## Description

The Museum of Contemporary Digital Art (MoCDA) is a museum platform founded in 2019. We seek to support the digital art category by documenting, collecting and advancing the position of digital art in a global context through unique curatorial insight and education.

Our team features experienced curators who share the ambition of providing many exciting opportunities to learn about the creative potential of digital tools, including the metaverse. In the past two years, we curated international art shows around the world including New York, London, Istanbul and Venice. MoCDA hosted many special events aimed at presenting and discussing what makes digital culture and art unique.
We bring our expertise in opening IRL exhibitions to the metaverse by experimenting with unique features that Decentraland offers to curators and artists alike. We are always seeking innovative ways to diversify and expand the platform.

We have organised several special exhibitions at the University District in Decentraland over the past two years, welcoming thousands of visitors. Three of the most recent exhibitions we opened:
“Digital Embodiments And Interventions: The Sculptural World of Marjan Moghaddam” (4th June-10th September 2021), solo show featuring a selection of works by pioneering artist Marjan Moghaddam
“Memento Minti - If you stop contributing, you will be forgotten” (8th January-27th March 2022), group show featuring Jisu Choe, Dancevatar, Silvio Lorusso, Nicolas Sassoon and Sasha Stiles
“(Do Not) Touch” (8th April-2nd July 2022), group show featuring Sasha Katz, Baron Lanteigne and Martina Menegon
These exhibitions attracted thousands of visitors. For example, “Memento Minti”’s POAP was collected 1600+ times in the first two days and “(Do Not) Touch” collected 1200+ times within the first hour.
The work of our dedicated team for each Decentraland exhibition involves preliminary research, installation planning and curatorial strategies.

Our curators will always plan at least three special events associated with each exhibition. This will enable more opportunities for visitors to visit the show and take full advantage of Decentraland’s space as a social environment, where people from diverse backgrounds can gather to enjoy art and interact with one another.

## Description

Providing Advertising Space Facilities and Loyalty Points schemes are proven to encourage engagement in marketplaces, social platforms and all.

AD Boosters will discover items in a high supply economy boosting high and low-exposure items:

FACT - According to ‘OnlineSales.ai’, “Introducing merchant-funded product listing ads can give a boost (to the Bottomline of the marketplace) of more than 50% of the revenue generated through GMV (Gross Merchandise Value). It significantly strengthens the revenue model of a marketplace.”

Loyalty Programme:

FACT:-

*   According to FORBES, “78% of consumers are more likely to buy from a brand with a loyalty program.”
*   According to FinExtra, “71% of consumers say loyalty rewards programs are a meaningful part of their brand relationship.”

Selling wearables – Noticeably, a large supply of wearables enters the marketplace daily, giving sellers less time on the ‘Newest Items’ list and at the top of the item category page.

The grant will fund version 1.0, the initial instalment to AD BOOSTER & LLP. We anticipate that there will be further updates & added features required, post the project going LIVE from internal & external sources. Internally, being analysing user activity and externally, being user feedback.

DCL as a platform does not have a blanket music license, and its terms and conditions hold land owners responsible for any activity on their land. This means ALL of us need our own terms and conditions built into our properties and any and all appropriate licenses to communicate music.

We have been having discussions with SOCAN (the music licensing body in Canada), about the best way to approach protecting artists in the web3 space and the most appropriate way to move forward with licensing. Ultimately, SOCAN is a not-for-profit that exists to ensure artists get royalties from license fees whenever and wherever their work is communicated.

To be clear, SOCAN is not on a witch hunt, but these issues WILL be resolved with or without us. Now is the time for us to have an impact on what music licensing looks like in the web3 space. Together with these licensing bodies, we believe that we can build a bright future where everyone is protected and creators receive proper compensation for the communication of their works, whether at events in the meta, distribution of music via NFT, etc.

Whether we like it or not, the reality is that licensing needs to be addressed. We propose doing a Twitter Spaces AMA with SOCAN on July 28th to educate the community on current regulations and start the discussion about the best way to license this new space.
We are of the opinion that DAO funds should be used to blanket license anyone who purchases land to allow for more creative freedom to communicate music. We may decide as a community that the best way to proceed is to keep things decentralized, but then, as previously stated, the onus will be on us as landowners to ensure we are compliant.

OPTIONS:

1.  DAO pays retroactive licensing fees for all users and agrees to work with licensing bodies to pay for an annual blanket license moving forward. (I will help facilitate these conversations, and SOCAN can help to connect DCL Foundation with sister licensing bodies to move towards international compliance)

or

2.  Leave the responsibility to land owners to obtain their own licenses. This means land owners will need licenses for every jurisdiction where their end users reside.

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=02129b80-d143-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2)

## Summary

This proposal calls for attaching voting power to the original six official DCL L1 wearable collections, released in 2019. This includes :1) Community Contest; 2) DCL Launch; 3) Exclusive Masks; 4) Halloween 2019; 5) MCH Collection; & 6) Xmas 2019.


## Abstract

The question of attaching Voting Power (VP) to wearables is an important issue to members of the Decentraland community. To date, there have been at least four (4) proposals surrounding this topic. All of those that passed were approved before the introduction of the three-stage binding governance proposal process. The hope is that the solution proposed herein meets the demands of wearable stakeholders, and is both accepted by other stakeholders and viewed as technically feasible due to its limited application to only the six (6) first and official Decentraland wearables collections.

Previously passed proposals include:

*   On June 14, 2022, a non-binding poll to “Get voting power for your current L1 wearables and strengthen the wider community DAO participation” passed with 1,442,355 VP (76%/52 votes) in favor; 437,946 VP (24%/10 votes) against. This poll established initial community support for attaching VP to L1 wearables, without detailing specific implementation pathways or a detailed impact assessment. It additionally called for a subsequent proposal to determine a tiered VP allocation system based on the rarity category of items.

*   On June 26, 2022, a subsequent non-binding poll for “L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal” passed, with 2,920,657 VP (96%/55 votes) in favor; 146,49 VP (4%/9 votes) against. This poll did not contain any specific information on implementation pathways or impact assessment, however, it built on the previous poll, calling for distribution of VP to L1 wearables based on rarity level along the following parameters:

Mythic: 1000 VP

Legendary: 100 VP

Epic: 10 VP

Rare: 5 VP

Uncommon: 1 VP

The argument against attaching VP to L1 wearables has been primarily technical, with both the DAO Committee and other knowledgeable community members pointing to three primary challenges: First, the broad technical scale of attaching VP to wearables that are distributed across X# collections, all of which are held on separate contracts. Second, is the arbitrary distinction between L1 and L2 wearables, particularly given future conflicts that could arise due to emerging technologies that reduce L1 transaction fees (i.e. zK roll-ups and sidechains) or enable easy bridging of assets between L1 and L2. Third, is the fact that L1 wearables outside of the collections officially sold by DCL involved p2p transactions in which no MANA was burned from the ecosystem, and would effectively be creating double VP for these transactions.

This proposal aims to account for all of these critiques. After conducting an in depth analysis of L1 wearables, total/active voting power, and other VP-allocating assets - including LAND, MANA and Names - we have determined that while a blanket application of VP to all L1 wearables is impractical and difficult to justify, limiting the application to the OG6 official collections is justifiable quantitatively - accounting for nearly 70% of all L1 wearables; technically - being limited to only six (6) wearable collections; and qualitatively - linking VP to official DCL collections, with the amount of VP reasonably comparable to the amount of MANA spent/burned to purchase the one OG collection (Halloween 2019) that was officially sold (rather than given away) to the community.


## Motivation

This proposal seeks to resolve the issue of wearables VP, which has been a point of contention since passage of the first non-binding poll in June 2022. It aims to provide an implementation pathway that distributes wearable VP in as equitable a way as possible, while mitigating technical blockers. It further fulfills a demand that was made by the community with a relatively strong level of support, equating to nearly 20% of historical VP, however, was not enacted by the DAO committee because there was no clear implementation pathway.

While there was no initial promise of VP with purchase of early L1 wearables, assets from the Halloween 2019 collection remain the only officially-sponsored asset in which MANA was spent by community members, burned by the Foundation, and is not associated with any form of VP. The problem with some past solutions proposed by wearable stakeholders to attach VP to ALL L1 wearables is that, a) it is incredibly arduous to implement, particularly when considering distributing VP by rarity of each collection; b) it is somewhat arbitrary in that there is no precedent for such a VP-generating act; and c) In the majority of cases it would in fact be creating double VP in that wearables were purchased in a p2p transaction in which no MANA was burned, so the seller would have received MANA equating to VP and the buyer a wearable equating to VP. As a result of the above, an all encompassing L1 solution is technically impractical and both quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to justify.

The Halloween 2019 collection, however, was the first wearable collection after the Exclusive Masks beta, and the only collection partially sold by the Decentraland Foundation, raising 1,077,320 MANA in sales. Although subsequent collections in the 2019 wearable offerings were distributed for free or as a reward, this spent MANA, which was removed from the ecosystem, has not received any democratic utility. By attaching VP to these “initial offering” wearable collections (and only to these initial six), which are the foundation of the robust wearables market we see today, this proposal aims to assert wearables as an essential asset class - similar to MANA, LAND, and Names.


## Specification

Attach voting power, distributed by rarity to the six (6) official Decentraland wearable collections released in 2019. This includes:

1.  Community Contest
2.  DCL Launch
3.  Exclusive Masks
4.  Halloween 2019
5.  MCH Collection
6.  Xmas 2019

*   There are 48,620 total wearables in these six collections, spread across 7,583 wallets. This equates to nearly 70% of the 71,082 total L1 wearables, which are spread across 10,442 unique wallets.

VP will be distributed according to rarity as follows:

*   Mythic: 1000 VP

*   Legendary: 100 VP

*   Epic: 10 VP

*   Rare: 5 VP

*   Uncommon: 1 VP

*   There are 644 mythic across 189 unique wallets; 4,249 Legendary across 827 unique wallets; 17,382 Epic across 4,820 unique wallets; and 24,713 rares across 4,126 unique wallets.

In total this will create **1,796,691 VP**. This equates to less than 10% of the historically active VP in the DAO, and is less than 2x the amount of MANA spent (and burned) by community members to purchase Halloween 2019 wearables from the Decentraland Foundation.

\[Impacts & Implementation pathways are available for discussion on the Forum (https://forum.decentraland.org/t/draft-cumulative-layer-1-wearables-vp-proposal/11423), and will be included in the final Binding Governance Proposal]


## Conclusion

These six (6) original wearable collections from 2019 are the final group of initial offering assets that have no associated VP. Other assets in this category include MANA, LAND and Names. What unites these assets are the fact that they are tied to either the core Decentraland smart contracts, or were linked to a foundation-led asset sale in which MANA was burned or the assets were distributed freely to early project adopters.

Voting in favor of this proposal is meant to put a close to the question of creating additional voting power assets in the future. This final section of the proposal should be referred to if there are further attempts to use past precedent as an argue for extending VP to additional asset sets or categories.

## Abstract

Detailed presentation:
https://pointmotioncontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Motion-Mine-DAO-proposal-2021.pdf

MotionMine is a space that inspires wellness: users, who show up to exercise, follow the displayed activities on their chart. Using Point Motion markerless motion capture technology via any camera enabled device,  to track users physical activity and allow them to track their own progress and performance over time. We want to bring MotionMine to the metaverse in support of health as well as prosperity; where we reward activity with redeemed points that are interchangeable for wearables and other prizes.

## Description

By bringing an opportunity to be rewarded for being physically active, we can not only bring a healthy habit to our Decentraland citizens of being active, but this will also inspire other big brands like Adidas and Nike to explore how this space can be used to connect on values they represent. We also aim to solve a major health issues around the increasingly sedentary lifestyle inadvertently caused by extended use of virtual reality platforms.

1 in 4 people sit greater than 8 hours a day;
4 in 10 are physically inactive.
1 in 10 are both - they sit for more than eight
hours, and they're physically inactive.

This leads to serious health complications in the long term which do not protect or serve the best interests of our community.

Those involved in this are all citizens of Decentraland and want to see our community grow, included a partnership with the SciArtLab district in Decentraland.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

I would like to launch a clothing company in Decentraland. I have already created six tshirts that will each cost me about $1700 USD to publish. I have already invested in designing/creating the shirts and claiming the 'MeditateOnPeace' name (I also own the meditateonpeace.com, meditateonpeace.org and @meditateonpeace). The essence of the brand will be to encourage a positive mind set. The idea came to me during a special experience two years ago and I believe Decentraland is the perfect community/place to turn the idea into reality.


## Grant size

33,333 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x6e8f9e7961d30a435114ee5793614be7040f1210

## Description

MeditateOnPeace should receive funding to encourage the cultural development of Decentraland. The brand will encourage a positive mindset and lifestyle by getting involved in the community to provide services aligned with the brand (e.g. yoga classes, guided meditations, breath work, speakers, book club, etc...). I want MeditateOnPeace to be a brand built on positivity, open-mindedness, and community. The brand's mission is Peace & Prosperity.


## Specification

I have connected with one person online who has created the first six t-shirts. I will continue to rely on their expertise to convert my designs into wearables compatible with Decentraland.


## Personnel

Right now it just me and one other person I found on the internet to help bring my (simple) designs to life.


## Roadmap and milestones

I have already worked with someone to create six tshirts (technically twelve: six mens, six womens) and will launch them as soon as I receive the funds.  I will also immediately begin designing and creating more clothing. Eventually it would be nice to open a store/yoga studio and getting more involved in community events aligned with our brand (e.g. guided mediations, yoga classes, breath work, etc...).

## Abstract

This proposal is seeking DAO funding to organize, participate and host a Decentraland DAO IRL Meetup at MCON 2022, to be held in Denver Colorado from Sept. 6-10th. https://www.mcon.fun/

MNCON is a 4-day conference bringing together the crypto community for learning, fun, and experimental growth all about DAOS. Hosting a Decentraland DAO sponsored side event would be a great opportunity for us to promote and bring more awareness to what the DAO has been doing to a very receptive community of web3 enthusiasts.

## Description

There is nothing quite like an IRL event full of degen crypto-loving peeps to get creative ideas rolling. We feel it’s important for Decentraland to have more presence at IRL events to help encourage, educate and connect with builders and devs from across a wide range of communities. It’s a great way to attract new contributing members to our community,
showcase the pioneering progress of Decentraland DAO and its contributors, and get together to enjoy some good moments.

We are currently working with MCON conference organizers to secure a partnership with a larger event at the conference. Once we confirm the venue we will be sharing it here with the community. (Due to the condensed time frame we will be updating in the Discord channel and the forum as well)


## Specification

GOALS

We firmly believe that it is  beneficial for Decentraland DAO to be involved in events + IRL conversations about the potential of the metaverse, specifically open-source and decentralized projects. Decentraland DAO is a leader in the space and has one of the largest treasuries in terms of assets under management, however, because of the distributed nature of our operations, we do not have a significant IRL event presence. This event is the perfect opportunity to engage in such conversations with the community attending and increase the visibility of our DAO and its contributors. Our goal is to educate and attract new builders, deves, community members and more.


## Personnel

Fractilians (Decentraland DAO Facilitator) and Gino (Decentraland Governance Squad Product Lead)  will both be attending the conference and will be hosts for the Decentraland DAO Meetup Event. Fractilians is also a contributor to IRLArt based out of Denver https://irlart.com/pages/about-us. IRLArt crew  were previously recipients of a Decentraland DAO grant
https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69fd4d60-6777-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7,
So there already is a strong community of Decentraland DAO supporters that will be in attendance at MCON


## Roadmap and milestones

Documentation/Reporting

Fractilians will be documenting the event and will feature it on her DCL Reporter sream the following week → https://www.twitch.tv/fractilians
This stream will also be shared on the Decentraland DAO twitter, discord and YouTube.

Budget Break Down

$2,000 USD - Food and Drinks - This will be our contribution to the event we partner with

$1,000 USD - Working on Merch to giveaway during the event - Stickers, Beanies or Tote Bags - We will update the community when those designs are finalized and will share specific costs once we get confirmation.

\*This grant is only to support the hosting of a Decentraland DAO gathering at the MCON conference. All DAO representatives will already be in attendance at the conference, and paying their own way, or cover costs through other means.

Should the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

The goal of this proposal is to perform a systematic analysis on all community proposals made to the DAO between May 2021 and Nov 2021 to discover trends and understand if there could be improvements to the DAO proposal mechanism designed to increase valuable proposals acceptance rate. A higher proposal quality will foster community engagement and result in a better community experience.

## Description

Between May 2021 and Nov 2021 there have been 353 community proposals made to the DAO. The hypothesis behind this research is that there were valuable ideas behind the rejected proposals that were not expressed cohesively in order for its value to be easily comprehensible. This research project will systematically review all community proposals made between those dates and analyze dimensions such as length, title description, use of acronyms, clear output, set dates, etc. to uncover trends. The output will be a list of changes and recommendations on the community proposal process to address the discoveries made, if any.


## Specification

This research project will be carried out in three phases:

*   Phase 1: Data Collection. Determine qualitative and quantitative analysis dimensions. Review all 353 proposals and systematically evaluate them against analysis criteria.
*   Phase 2: Data Analysis. Perform quantitative and qualitative research in order to discover trends and potential casualties on the proposal outcomes.
*   Phase 3: Recommendations. Produce suggestions on potential improvements for the DAO community proposal based on the research findings.


## Personnel

Franco Amorosi. Economist, MSc in Public Policy. LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoamorosi.

I’m eager to get involved with Decentraland’s community. What interests me is to understand how DAO’s governance works and to design mechanisms that improve community engagement.

I will donate the grant from this research project to Amnesty International, an NGO that protects people’s human rights like free speech, and campaigns to end abuses such as discriminatory laws.


## Roadmap and milestones

Phase 1: Data Collection. 1 month.
Phase 2: Data Analysis. 2 weeks.
Phase 3: Recommendations. 2 weeks.

This project will be completed and the final report shared by the end of January 2022.

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Custome Spawn Locations](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7c50f0f0-0508-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)

## Summary

instead of spawning only in genesis plaza you can spawn where ever you set it to.


## Abstract

Myself and alot of the community would like to spawn in different locations aside genesis plaza. I think it would be great to be able to spawn at any place on the map.


## Motivation

Always spawning in genesis plaza can get rather boring and sometimes it would be nice to be able to spawn else where. I imagine having a house on a parcel and being able to spawn there when i load the client so it feels you load into your home within Decentraland. Or even spawn at a favourite location.


## Specification

the developers of DCL could impliment this feature


## Impacts

Best case scenario, you can set a location to where you will spawn in. Instead of Genesis plaza.

Mid case Scenario: Being able to spawn at the location you logged off or last visited.

So many of the community love griding various games and would love to spawn there.


## Implementation Pathways

This should be fairly easy for the decentraland development team to impliment into the client. from feedback in the forums last location may be easeier. It would be prefered for custome spawns but last location will be great also. alot of people are just bored of genesis plaza. Its great for new players but for seasoned players its very boring.


## Conclusion

In conclusion i believe that this feature is much needed and feel it can be implimented easily to the decentraland client.

They say comedy and laughter bring people together, and we strongly believe that! With this grant funding we plan to create memorable content to share and enjoy within the Decentraland community, but mainly to utilize this unique platform to create a surge of new users coming into DECNTRLAND because of COMEDY!

This one-of-a-kind experience will bring the sold-out festival to a large, global audience and mainly bring fans and comics into DECENTRLAND.

Full festival lineup can be found here:

**Our vison is, we want Decentraland to be the Hub for Comedy in the Metaverse.**

Acquiring funding through the DAO will make it possible for Decentral Comedy to engage in a one-of-a-kind promotion to promote Decentraland directly to top comics and their fans alike.

Skankfest features a full lineup of over 150 talented acts across 6 stages, over a three-day period. Decentral Comedy is planning a full marketing campaign utilizing the Gas Digital Network and the SOLD-OUT comedy festival, Skankfest to promote Decentraland in a never-before-seen marketing play to onboard new comics and in turn their fans alike.

The marketing play we are proposing is more then just impressions and having a banner on websites, its personally being able to onboard and introduce the world of DCL to 150 top level comics (which will include their fanbase) and 5000 live fans, sending the message that Decentraland is where comedy lives and thrives in the Metaverse.


## Specification

Skankfest GOLD Sponsorship Package + Attendance + onsite costs + additional promotion activities to onboard new users (wallet promo): $65,000

Decentral Comedy will plan and implement the full marketing campaign utilizing the Gas Digital network to promote DCL as the hub for comedy in the Metaverse the tailor made  package for our unique set of needs includes:

●	3 Full Days Oct 14-16,2022 + Thursday night Opening Party - backstage access for exclusive content for DCL.
●	A 12m. sq. booth located in the greenroom promoting DCL as “The Hub for Comedy in the Metaverse”.  The booth will include a podcast station to record exclusive content with comics for the metaverse and onboarding stations for our staff to walk comics through the benefits of bringing their content (and in turn fan base) into this new world called Decentraland.  We plan to work directly with the DCL Foundation on marketing efforts and we want to market DCL first and foremost at the festival and DC as the partner to ease the comics into the space.
●	A campaign to directly onboard new fans with a portion of the grant funding going to NEW USERS that will set up a meta mask wallet on the spot and enter DCL for the first time = the ability to track.
●	Logo will appear on all promotional material.  Digital Footprint of Skankfest Vegas is expected to eclipse 30 million Impressions – Decentraland/DC will be included as a main sponsor on all of that.
●	Video Footage and Pictures will feature your logo and team in live social media postings
●	In-person attendance by the Decentral Comedy team for onboarding comics/fans
●	Exclusive access to behind-the-scenes areas to generate awareness amongst comedians and attendees that the content will be accessible on an ongoing basis in DCL.
●	4 all access passes to do a giveaway in DCL or on social media these passes are worth $500 USD per ticket and the festival is sold out – cross promote comedy fans and DCL.
●	Decentraland Green Room Podcast Station – first of its kind.
●	Post Festival Email to all attendees featuring an exclusive promoting Decentraland as the Hub of Comedy in the Metaverse.

Content Streaming + Video Capture: $23,500
We will have a full team onsite to capture content exclusively for Decentraland capturing content (which in turn will encourage the attendee and GAS digital fans to find and try DCL to access that footage) we will also be capturing content with a 3D camera for future use once DCL introduces VR capabilities.
Our team will then be executing all postproduction which includes editing, mixing/mastering, and color correction to debut the exclusive content in DCL.

## Roadmap and milestones

This project will take 6 months to develop and can be broken down into monthly deliverables:

Month 1: Logistical and planning aspects are confirmed. Our aggressive marketing strategy begins.  Creating the Decentraland booth/experience for Skankfest in Vegas.

Month 2: Attendance at Skankfest, full promotion of DCL and Decentral Comedy in full effect.  Onboarding of comics + Fans = New users. Exclusive content to be created and filmed at Skankfest for DCL.

Month 3: DC  following up and onboarding comics directly into the new world.  Creating a database of comedy content which other venues will be able to use (as we already provide comedy content to other spaces in the world regularly).  Taking all the raw footage shot at the festival, editing, and producing it into a best of the fest experience that we will be promoting to fans to attend.

Month 4: The Skankfest DCL Experience launches in Early November 2022 in our Decentral Comedy Club.  Continue to follow up and onboard new comics and fans.

Month 5: Continue to follow up and onboard new comics and fans.

Month 6: Onboard new comics and fans. Full report to the DAO on new users were introduced to DCL through this promotion = comics were onboarded + how many fans from the festival itself (which we will track through a metamask promo at the festival) + how many fans (NEW USERS) directly came into the world to see their favorite comic – still working on a way to track this with DCL itself.

## NFT Collection(s) description

Starting off with the already published wearable GUNKDUMP HELMET, this piece represents the helmet of a graphic illustration I designed that serves as the brand's mascot, the Dead Astronaut. This astronaut can be found around the social media accounts as itself or printed on clothing, and depicts an ominous astronaut with a burning helmet and symbolic 'G' as the head. I had planned on accumulating more MANA to publish the rest of the astronaut's outfit. The next one would be a matching animated playing card NFT on opensea, Dead Astronaut 'Hearts' Card. Alongside that card is the card of 'Nemesis Astronaut' which I had planned to also publish as an outfit wearable which includes a rival antagonist astronau, Nemesis Astronaut 'Spades' Card.


## Governance

My name is Armen Tsatou and I am the rightful owner to GUNKDUMP. I created www.gunkdump.com and manage all of the social media accounts. My website is www.armentsatou.com, instagram is @guply, and if any other information or confirmation is needed I will gladly give it.


## Motivation

I am the CEO and sole proprietor of streetwear label GUNKDUMP. For the past year and a half, GUNKDUMP has entered the web3 space and numerous NFT collectables have been minted including a helmet wearable based off of one of the main designs, published months ago. I had wished for another way to add more representation of the brand into Decentraland, while not having enough funds to mint another wearable, and this is the perfect opportunity for just that. The 3D designer that I had commissioned for the wearable had already made a few glb files of IRL GUNKDUMP clothing and designs that I would most definitely like to have manifested into linked wearables.

## Roadmap and milestones

Our north star remains the same: **We will continue improving the mechanisms for which the DAO Community engages with the governance process to lower the friction and increase the quality and frequency of contributions to the DAO**. Those contributions could take the form of participation in proposal voting and discussion, engagement with grants or ongoing projects, and discussions in working groups or public spaces such as Discord and the Forum.

The work planned ahead is organized on three main themes (Engagement, Community Building, and Development Experience) that will guide the development journey. We are maintaining the Engagement theme from our previous Grant and proposing two new ones.

**To see a detailed breakdown of proposed initiatives please click [here](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/DAO-Governance-Squad-2H2022-Renewal-Proposal-044b3a5f2a70477ea05e0ebf4cb77833#067c72c55ff644e19e60c07c5919cdd0)**.  Roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and needs.

The team will follow [agile development practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) to ensure a lean implementation of DAO governance requirements and continuous improvement of such features. **The team will provide updates to the community, gather feedback and answer questions at the open DAO Town Hall meetings and over Discord.**

15422,15422,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should the Wearable Publication Fee Be Adjusted Weekly to Reflect a Set Fiat Value?,"> by 0xb9c4fd82a47df3b5864266a293a3516d484590b9 (Vulpixie#90b9)

**Summary**
This is a proposal to adjust the current wearable publication fee in light of the increase in value of MANA.

**Overview**
A wearable publication fee is important to disincentivize spam, promote high-quality wearables submissions, and compensate the members of the Curation Committee, among other things.

With the sudden rise in value of MANA, and the general volatility of the crypto market, a flat MANA fee can price both current and up-and-coming creators out of the marketplace.

Instead of a flat MANA fee, the fee should be based on MANA’s current fiat value.
When MANA was $1 USD or lower a 500 MANA fee per item was reasonable. However with MANA currently over $2 USD, paying 500 MANA upfront to submit a design is not possible for many creators.

By maintaining the 500 MANA fee the Wearables Editor becomes available only to established creators and others with deep pockets and excludes young and newer creators who cannot afford $1000 USD or more to submit a wearable.

**Limitations**
Having the wearable publication fee tied directly to fiat value would be complicated as value can change by a few pennies on any given day. Not only would this create a need for fractional MANA transactions, but it could have the unintended consequence of creators waiting for some ideal price to submit their designs.

**The solution is to have a fee with a set value that is adjusted weekly.**
At a set time once per week, the wearable publication fee would be set based on the current USD fiat value of the token, so that the fee is approximately $500 USD rounded to the nearest whole MANA.

This would eliminate the need for fractional MANA transactions and would keep the value of the fee relatively constant. Any dramatic change in value is corrected by the next week, allowing the fee to remain relatively constant regardless of changes in the value of MANA.

**Proposal**
This serves as a proposal to once weekly adjust the wearable publication fee so that the fiat value is approximately equivalent to $500 USD, rounded to the nearest whole MANA instead of a flat MANA fee. The Curation Committee’s compensation would be proportionally adjusted to remain at 10% of the fee.

- Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee on a Weekly Basis to Reflect an Approximate Fiat Value
- Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee at a Different Frequency to reflect an Approximate Fiat Value
- Leave the Wearable Publication Fee at 500 MANA

Hello I am Mendez, and I've been a core contributor of Decentraland since Jan 2018. This is my first governance proposal ever since.

Several people have brought this problem to my attention and I acknowledge this as a vulnerability that needs to be addressed before it starts affecting people and their digital lives.

In Decentraland, users’ addresses represent more than a transaction parameter in a blockchain, they are part of a user’s digital identity, and exposing this information along with real-time position data could lead to a form of digital surveillance that could be damaging to users and to Decentraland itself.

Catalyst communications server exposes an API endpoint that responds with user addresses and their exact locations at every moment, facilitating hostile actors to harass platform users. This API could also enable the creation of hate bots that could target specific users or types of audiences. This type of information should be treated as sensitive to prevent these types of scenarios. The endpoints to be removed are:

*   https://peer.decentraland.org/comms/peers
*   https://peer.decentraland.org/comms/islands

These endpoints are not needed in order for Decentraland to work. In fact, they were originally intended for manual debugging purposes only.

However, by removing the endpoints in question, there is also a drawback: this API is used to know if a user is in a specific location at the time of making a request. In some scenes, this feature is used by some anti-bot mechanisms. To that extent, a new API endpoint is proposed to validate if a user is in a specific position on a case-by-case basis instead of tracking all the users all the time. For analytics/statistical information of islands, new privacy-aware endpoints were already created [/stats/parcels](https://peer.decentraland.org/stats/parcels)

Summary of the proposed changes:

*   Remove the `/comms/peers` and `/comms/islands` endpoints. Use `/stats/parcels` instead
*   Create a new endpoint to validate if a user holding the specified address is in the specified position

- Remove the endpoints
- Keep the endpoints

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Custome Spawn Locations](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7c50f0f0-0508-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)

## Summary

Instead of spawning only in genesis plaza, add a feature to spawn where you desire to.


## Abstract

@SirDropBear and a lot of community members would like to spawn in different locations besides genesis plaza. I think it would be great to be able to spawn at any place on the map.


## Motivation

Always spawning in genesis plaza can get rather boring and sometimes it would be nice to be able to spawn elsewhere. I imagine having a house on a parcel and being able to spawn there when I load the client so it feels you load into your home within Decentraland. Or even spawn at a favorite location.


## Specification

If this proposal passes, the Foundation should implement a new setting on the Decentraland reference client. Such a setting would be called ""Default Spawn Location"" and it would allow the user to appear:

*   On Genesis Plaza (the current default)
*   On a custom location (which the user can decide)
*   On the last position where the user closed the client (which doesn't sync across different browsers/clients)

See ""Implementation pathways"" below for more details.


## Impacts

Best case scenario, you can set a location to where you will spawn in. Instead of Genesis plaza.

Mid case Scenario: Being able to spawn at the location you logged off or last visited.

So many of the community love grinding various games and would love to spawn there.


## Implementation Pathways

The reference client should have a new Setting, called ""Default Spawn Position"" with three options:

*   Genesis Plaza (0,0)
*   Last Position
*   Custom Position

If the third option is selected, then an input is enabled that allows the user to select one fixed position for their client to start.
The second option *does not* require the last position to be synced across different browsers/clients (it should be treated as a local setting, such as the sound volume)


## Conclusion

This is a low-hanging fruit that would make many members of the community happy!

This proposal aims to return Land to the community of original Contributors of District X (formerly known as “Red Light District”). District X, which is one of the largest on the platform, has been appropriated by an authoritarian District Leader who has chosen to flout community rules, ignore contributors whilst operating and managing the District as a single entity for personal gain. District Leader now claims ownership of over 2,000 (!) Land. This, we argue, goes against the rationale and ethos of Decentraland and its community.

We propose that District X contributors should be given the opportunity to present their case to the DAO in order to regain decentralised, accountable and democratic control of the District. Contributors should be returned the rightful ownership of their Land, which, after all, they contributed to make the District possible in the first place. If approved, Land ownership should be transferred back to Contributors. We seek advice on two possible resolutions: complete ownership or a royalty system.

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Restructuring Wearables Submission Fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=128084f0-e1dc-11ec-bdb6-655e1f599935)

## Summary

Set the wearable submission to $150 USD worth of MANA and set the curators compensation to $50 USD per item reviewed.


## Abstract

This proposal aims to align the DCL community about how the wearable submission fee should be structured. The proposal gives more context about the history, motivations and economics of the fee and also proposes a new scheme.


## Motivation

The Wearables Marketplace was originally launched on  [June 1st 2021](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/) , with the goal of empowering a creators economy by giving users a wide variety of choices to express themselves and giving creators the tools to monetize their work.

Every creator that submits a new wearable to the marketplace is asked to pay a fee in MANA (Wearable Submission Fee). This fee is necessary to:

*   Cover the compensation of the curator that will review the submission to ensure technical soundness and protect against IP infringements.

*   Limit the cost of *perpetually* hosting the wearable in the Catalyst Decentralized Network.

*   Foster the continual growth of Decentraland platform and its community via giving those fees to the DAO and funding the Community Grants program.

The wearable submission fee was originally set to 500 MANA, with a MANA price of ~0.8 USD. However when the MANA price reached the $2 USD mark the community raised their concerns via  [a proposal to automatically adjust the fee to a fixed amount of 500 USD payable in MANA was voted.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)

The proposal noted that pegging the publication fee to USD was healthy for the creators’ economy. It allows the creators to better budget their projects and market their services without exposing them to the fluctuation of the MANA price.

The proposal was raised to the Security Advisory Board and decided to lower the wearable submission fee one-time to 100 MANA as a temporary measure in the waiting for an automated solution. This change was announced in the  [DAO Committee Report #12](https://decentraland.org/blog/project-updates/dao-committee-report-12/) .

Since then, the price of MANA has come down to the $1 USD mark and the current fee seems too low. The curator committee is getting 10 MANA per item review and it doesn’t seem up to the responsibility of the role. At the same time, going back to a 500 USD fee is shocking for new creators in the Decetraland community.

This proposal aims to restructure the current wearable submission fee to a more sustainable framework. The goal is to keep the fee at minimum while still covering the expenses for the marketplace to work.


## Specification

Below is the specification of how the Wearable Submission Fee should be structured:

*   The fee amount should be set at a fixed USD price, but paid in MANA.

*   The fee should cover the work of a curator to review the submission.

*   The fee should support the catalyst network.

*   The fee should support the DAO to continue investing in Grants.

The first item has been addressed by the Decentraland Foundation team by creating a new version of the marketplace smart contracts that uses a Chainlink oracle to get the current MANA price. This way the fee is paid in MANA but the amount is set in USD.

Regarding the compensation of the curator for each review, a price of **$50 USD per item reviewed** seems fair. The curation might take between 30 minutes and several hours depending on the feedback cycles with creators.

The catalyst network is currently formed by 11 servers that hosts all the content of Decentraland’s world, including wearable 3d models, scene content and avatar selections. Half of the Catalyst servers are runned by Decentraland Foundation and the rest by individual community members.

The cost of hosting a Catalyst server is ~600 USD per month. The total annual cost to run the 11 servers is ~$80,000 USD. At this moment this cost is paid by catalyst owners and is not subsidized by the DAO, but it totally should, **and part of the Wearable Submission Fee should be allocated to subsidize catalyst owners.**

In the past year 5,530 wearables have been submitted to the marketplace, so if we maintain this publication rate, **a fee of 15 USD per wearable** should be enough to account for catalyst expenses for a year.

And finally, the DAO should get a fee to continue investing in the Grants Program, fostering the development and growth of the platform. **A contribution between 50 and 100 USD should be allocated for this purpose.**

**Wearable Submission Fee = 150 USD**

*   33% = 50 USD go to the curator
*   10% = 15 USD to supporting catalyst servers
*   57% = 85 USD goig to the DAO to support the Grant’s Program.


## Impacts

This proposal will be beneficial to creators by derisking how they budget projects and promote their services, removing the volatility of MANA from the equation.

The proposed value of $150 USD per submitted wearable should be attractive to many talented creators while still preventing spam and supporting the underlying cost of running a wearables marketplace.

A potential risk is to incentivize the submissions of low-quality wearables, making the curation process longer and rising the cost of running a catalyst. This could be mitigated by implementing more automation over the process curation process and/or raising the price in the future with a new governance process.


## Implementation Pathways

Decentraland Foundation with the help of the Security Advisory Board will deploy the update of the marketplace's smart contracts to set the wearable submission to $150 USD payable in MANA.

The DAO Committee will issue payments to curators on monthly basis at a new rate of $50 USD per curation. The DAO Committee will propose a mechanism to distribute compensation to catalyst owners over time.


## Conclusion

This proposal aims to set the wearable submission fee to a USD value in order to better support the creators economy, derisking them from market volatility, enabling to budget projects and market their services at a expectable rate.

Economics considerations have been made to ensure that a fee of 150 USD can cover the compensation of the curators, a subsidy to the catalyst network and keep reinvesting in the growth of the platform.

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

BitBears is a project that was born in Decentraland circa February 2021 and has consistently supported community growth by providing a gateway for new users into a positive and inclusive environment so that they may overcome the initial introductory experience and enjoy all aspects of Decentraland accompanied by a mass of instant friends. From BitBears, came the Bear Gang, a community welcoming to all members of the DCL Metaverse; now with the creation of the FIVE factions, the Bear Gang has developed a Participate-to-Own model which encourages user interaction in activities spanning across all areas of Decentraland and supports user growth in the space. Users are awarded wearable content as a result of entry + ongoing participation.

## Description

Born in Decentraland, BitBears is a project that has impacted the community on many levels. We have collaborated with many developing brands for events, as well as provided a platform for many users to exhibit their talents and contribute to the betterment of the community. Our primary focus has always been enhancing the user experience and providing an environment for inclusivity.

Through the development of the Bear Gang, we have unified users of DCL and provided a Metaversal culture whereby new users taking their first steps into DCL are able to instantly find friends with common interest to share with their explorations. Wherever you may be in DCL, you can always count on a Bear Head being present.   Whilst there have been many descriptions presented of ‘play-to-earn’, ‘participate-to-earn’ and similar methods of engagement, our mission differs in that we have developed a strategy we call Participate-to-Own. We do not incentivise earning as we believe the true value in participation in web-3 lies with the ability to own as a result and therefore would encourage our participants to keep hold of their awarded assets to remain connected. We believe in DCL long term + feel the networks established by continued ownership far outweigh the thrill of the flip.   

Since our inception, BitBears has been built from the ground-up, through the vision of Cosy + the gang, from a 2d art work into an established Metaverse community. We have consistently reinvested time, money and efforts into the development of our DCL experience and our goal is to continue providing a gateway for new users.   

Participate-to-own explained in more detail:

From BitBears became the Bear Gang and from the Bear Gang we have developed FIVE factions: RED GANG, ICE GANG, GOLD GANG, PINK GANG and BLUE GANG. These factions were created to incentivise activity in DCL. We are not self-motivated and we therefore, encourage participation in ALL events in order for users to ‘participate’ and increase activity in the Metaverse, we call our attending of events ‘METAVERSE INVASIONS’ and encourage as many Bear Heads as possible to attend, enjoy and show support to those hosting.

Through the FIVE factions we have created a competitive element where the most active factions are awarded the ability to exhibit an event of their own at our DCL HQ. As users participate in INVASIONS we encourage them to post photo’s and video’s in our Discord and on Twitter to share their adventures with the wider community. The most active faction members, which can be easily monitored by perusal of activity submitted to our server within the dedicated faction channels, are awarded with upgraded wearables as a result of their contribution to the space.

  Our goal is to increase awareness of DCL and all of the events occurring within, increase user engagement and participation as well as provide a platform where new users can instantly find friends with common interest. As a result of this; new users entering the space can eliminate the feeling of loneliness and are immediately welcomed into our friendly environment.

By joining our community users gain access to:

A) ongoing Metaverse Invasions providing an entertainment element to their experience.

B) a network of likeminded individuals with the common interest in the development of the Metaverse. Up to now we have also provided a platform for many creators to collaborate including wearables designers, artists, video editors and musicians.


## Specification

We have continuously hosted events for the community to enjoy and we are now ready to take this to the next level.

This grant will enable us to pay for and achieve the following:   

1.  Increase our ability to finance the production and submittance of exclusive ‘leader’ wearables which will be distributed to faction leaders to incentivise participation so that there will always be active members managing + supporting the process and actively introducing new users.

  2) Increase our ability to finance the production and submittance of wearable content to giveaway as awards as users level up through activity.   

3.  Finance the creation of a website dedicated to informing users of BitBears, the Bear Gang and our presence in the Metaverse. This web app will be utilised as a Decentraland on-ramp, users will be able to discover the Bear Gang and we will provide them with a gateway to the metaverse, our site will focus on educating users on prerequisites such as setting up MetaMask and signing up to Decentraland and will provide them with access to an active community at the click of a button. New Members will be transported into Decentraland where they will enter our parcels as per the guidance included in our web page, users will be guided through a dedicated tutorial on our parcels; as a result of the tutorial they will unlock their first Bear Gang wearable (the DCL Bear Head), from which point they will be ready to explore the wider world of Decentraland, although as mentioned above, via this means, they will be ready to explore the space with the ability to instantly interact with members of the Bear Gang community that they discover along the way + join the faction of their choice in which their new found friends are involved.   

4.  Finance the building of an additional feature deployed on our land: A space that we have titled ‘THE ARENA’ which will be a place where the FIVE factions are able to compete against each other to provide a further utility associated with joining a faction and encourage members to strive to develop ‘the best / most active faction’. By participating in the challenges established in THE ARENA we will be able to provide a further competitive element to the process as well as maintain a fun and thrilling experience for the users to enjoy.

Whilst we mention the competitive element, the purpose of factions is not division, in fact, the purpose is inclusivity. Factions merely adds an extra layer of entertainment to the experience and encourages users to sustain an active role in the process, as in order to advance and gain the spotlight, factions are reliant on ALL members to contribute. Team work, makes the dream work.


## Personnel

How will this grant benefit Decentraland?   Via the Bear Gang, we have created a stage for aspiring creators to demonstrate their talents, we encourage participation in many areas ie: through the showcasing of personal portfolios of works or through enabling discovery of connections which help to shape collaborations. We consider the Bear Gang as a place where the beauty of web-3 connectivity can be truly embraced.

DCL is our native platform from which these relationships are made and we are extremely tenacious about making the most of the opportunity herein.   When BitBears were first produced, the characters were created as a comical meme culture reference. Some editions marked significant moments in our development as a project and others were created for the fun of expression. However, since our inception and the development of our loving community, the BitBear underlying character now carries a lot more significance; the character now represents the blockchain revolution + the formation of community, through the celebration of art, the metaverse and web-3.


## Roadmap and milestones

We believe that this grant will benefit Decentraland as we do not place ourselves as the focus of this subject; we have created this strategy to place EVERYBODY in Decentraland as the focus and develop a user-onboarding platform from which we can encourage new users to enter the DCL Metaverse. Through our Participate-to-Own model, we want to demonstrate everything that is possible within Decentraland and showcase this to our userbase and target audience. As mentioned previously, users are not awarded for internal activity, but rather, for actively exploring all that Decentraland has to offer and showcasing these experiences with the wider community. Our competitive element, featuring the ‘ARENA’ is merely an extra layer to the experience, to enable us/the gang as creators to provide input, score the most active participants + duly reward them for their contributions to the space. Our website will be an educational resource for new users to discover Decentraland via an alternate avenue and will function as a portal into the Metaverse, where they will be able to begin their adventure.

Our aim is to complete the website + ARENA deployment by Q2 22 and the development and submitting of wearable awards will be completed on an ongoing basis.

Thank you all for your consideration.

A proposal for a committee of subject matter experts responsible for moderating and approving wearables submitted to Decentraland.

**Abstract:**

*   The upcoming Wearables Editor is a simple tool that will allow people to upload and publish wearables that they have designed and built using 3D modeling software.
*   Wearables in Decentraland need to be moderated in order to prevent spam, abuse, duplicated content, and copyright infringements (as per Decentraland's [Content Policy](https://decentraland.org/content), [Terms of Use](https://decentraland.org/terms), and [Code of Ethics](https://decentraland.org/ethics)).
*   The proposed Wearables Curation Committee would be responsible for reviewing and approving all submitted wearables.
*   The Curation Committee would review submissions, ensuring that wearables meet some minimum technical requirements in addition to meeting the requirements of Decentraland's Content Policy, Terms of Use, and Code of Ethics.
*   Community members may be added and removed through the Decentraland DAO.

**Specification:**

For the full description of the Wearables Curation Committee and wearables acceptance criteria, [refer to this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUxbLEAnWnUPh7QtUz5cZMuLziKqrYNE5bLPtw1bJA4/edit?usp=sharing).

Should the DAO set up a formal process for establishing and facilitating working groups to resolve core community issues in the DAO's dedicated Discord server?

Working Groups allow engaged members of the DCL community to collaborate and ultimately solve the problems and opportunities identified in Pre-Proposal Polls. Since opening the dedicated DAO discord, DAO Facilitators have been following an informal process for mediating collaborative resolution of core issues, following passage of a pre-proposal poll. The proposal will aim to formalize the process of creating working groups for the community following the passage of a ""pre-proposal poll,"" leading to the submission of a well-thought-out and socialized governance proposal.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

After everyone's feedback we decided to narrow the scope. This will allow us to demonstrate that we deliver and that our product adds value to DCL users.

Our mission is to improve the event’s ecosystem in DCL. Our solution consists of three sections: DApp, SDK and Builder:

*   An event management & NFT ticketing DApp, which we call Fanszoid
*   Custom code for the DCL SDK that integrates with our platform
*   Simple and user-friendly smart items for the DCL Builder

We've been developing for the last 8 months. Last week we launched our first version of the product. We hope to see you in our launch event (Sat 8PM UTC)

With this grant we will be able to support our actual team for 6 months and also help us get to a point of sustainability.


## Grant size

60,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xc7FA9db5CfF0a1132828aeabe57769F56cae524F

## Description

Our objective is to address one of the biggest opportunities regarding metaverse events: **monetization**. Nowadays only a small percentage of tech savvy organizers have figured out how to mint their own NFT collection and sell them as tickets for an event.

Managing tickets as NFTs provides many advantages:

*   Fraud free ticket resale & ticket trading
*   Tickets sync with blockchain address
*   Royalties to organizers on each resale
*   The possibility of trading an event ticket post event because of the attached value
*   Tickets will be seen as collectibles
*   Native Integrations with Decentraland

Offering a ticketing solution will appeal to promoters and artist managers where they can easily derive revenue from sales where currently this is the unknown within virtual world experiences \[being mostly free].

Bear in mind that we have a lot of people that want to do things on the metaverse, but they just don't know how. Now, there’s a tool to help them do it. Therefore bringing new people to the ecosystem.

Our primary objective is to bring a lot of value to Decentraland and the Decentraland community, such as:

*   Make available a NFT ticket marketplace
*   Generate a new revenue stream for all event organizers
*   Bring more use cases to LAND parcels and therefore increase their value
*   Facilitate collaboration between brands and metaverse creators for sponsoring events
*   Increase amount of events hosted


## Specification

In order for this to be possible we’ve built a team to develop a decentralized application where users will be able to create and promote events, browse, buy and resell tickets, and manage sales and statistics in a dashboard.

Our backend stack consists of:

*   Smart contracts:  Events (ERC721) , Tickets (ERC1155) and Marketplace.
*   Subgraph to index the blockchain data.
*   A NodeJS API that aggregates data from the subgraph and allows event organizers to monitor event sales, check ownership of tickets, etc.

Using our platform, event organizers will be able to:

*   Divide their LAND into sections: General, VIP, Ultra VIP, and so on.
*   Use a Builder Smart Item to easily limit access to a LAND ( or LAND section ) to ticket owners.
*   Dress users in each section with different wearables which will only be available during the event
*   Attach a wearable to a ticket that the user will be able to use in all Decentraland, creating value for the ticket after the event.
*   Add POAP’s to every event in one click with our seamless integration

The grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-2 signatures Multisig. Participants are Julian Neuss and Juan Oliva.

### Conditions of the Grant

The Grant is conditioned to the satisfaction and fulfillment of each and all of the following:

*   Fanszoid’s team shall use the funds from the Grant solely for the purpose of developing and maintaining the Fanszoid platform, as described in below, in accordance with the roadmap detailed below (“Roadmap and Milestones”).
*   Fanszoid’s team shall set up a Multisig Wallet, for purposes of receiving the Grant, with the signatories indicated above. Disbursements of the Grant shall be conditioned upon achieving the roadmap milestones and presented in the monthly reports within the timeframe set forth below.
*   Fanszoid’s team will provide the DAO with the following information:
    *   Within five (5) days of the beginning of each month, a Monthly Progress Report regarding the development of the Fanszoid platform and the achievement of Milestones will be presented to the DAO.
    *   Within ten (10) days of the beginning of each month, Monthly Financial Report showing use of the proceeds of the Grant.
*   Upon failure to comply with any of the conditions of above by Fanszoid’s team, the vesting contract will be revoked by the DAO, returning unvested funds.

Budget: 10,000 USD per month, including payroll and operational expenses.


## Roadmap and milestones

The roadmap will be divided into 3 stages:

**Stage 1**. First we will help DCL organizers to create events using our platform while also developing more features and building partnerships with event organizers and districts.

**Stage 2**. Once the user base starts to flourish events will be frequently created. Now our focus will shift from doing manual things to getting sure the platform can scale. For this we will create a strong documentation and tutorial videos. Meanwhile we will still develop new features.

**Stage 3**. By this stage we expect to have a decent amount of monthly events hosted throughout our platform, be it from individual organizers to several districts. The team will keep delivering features and set metrics to track growth. All the statistics gathered will be shared with Decentraland.

Possible upcoming tasks:

*   Develop Secondary Marketplace for safe ticket resale
*   Add POAP integration
*   Develop Smart Item for the Decentraland Builder
*   Accept more wallets on the DApp
*   Accept Fiat/VISA payments on the DApp
*   Prepare code and SDK documentation & tutorials
*   Build Ranking, Favorites, Support, Statistics and Status pages

Fanszoid will use agile development practices to ensure a fast implementation of all requirements and the continuous improvement of such features.

Also, the team will be available every month to host an open meeting with members of the DCL community to talk about upcoming steps.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Decentraland has been using [Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io), a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the [launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor) of the new user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.

Biconomy, is changing his business model requiring projects to fund their own ""Gas tank"" to send meta transactions. Before they were costing all the transactions.

Since June 1, 2021 (~6 months ago) Decentraland has used 4k MATIC. I'm requesting ~15k MATIC to fund the Gas tank to keep transactions free in Polygon for at least ~1 year having into account that the average gas price can increase. *They have increased from 1 to 30 some months ago*


## Grant size

45,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed

## Description

In the Ethereum world, things happen thanks to transactions. These transactions, just like everything in life, don’t come for free. In order to create and execute a transaction, you need to pay a fee in the form of “Gas” which costs ETH. But what if you want to create a transaction and you don't want to pay for gas. This is where Meta-Transactions come.

**Meta-transactions** are transactions whose data is created and signed off-chain by one person and executed by another person who pays the gas fees.

**Decentraland** has been using meta transactions to provide users the best possible experience through the dApps and the explorer.  For example, creators have been creating **~600 smart contracts (collections)** without knowing that they were doing that and creating and trading **~630k NFTs** without spending any MATIC/ETH. Data from [here](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/decentraland/collections-matic-mainnet?query=Totals)

[Biconomy announcement:](https://bit.ly/3EF7dO4)

> We are super excited to announce the much-awaited product upgrade - Personalised Gas Tanks. In the future, each dApp will have its gas tank to sponsor gasless transactions for the end-user.
> What are the benefits of the gas tank?

> 1.  You get your very own and private gas tank for your dApp, which ensures that no transaction gets dropped or fails due to insufficient funds.

> 2.  All the native tokens you deposit will solely be used to sponsor gas for your end-users.

> 3.  Gas management and analytics features will allow you to control gas spending, set limits, and be on top of gas accounting.


## Specification

If the proposal passed, the steps will be:

*   Swap MANA to MATIC. We can use the Polygon MANA [collected here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xB08E3e7cc815213304d884C88cA476ebC50EaAB2) by the Wearables submissions and primary sales.

*   Deposit MATIC into the gas tank. To do this we can follow the following [tutorial](https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/gas-tank-deposits/via-smart-contract).

The funding key for the Decentraland Meta Transactions is `1639137842389`

The deposit smart contract needs to be passed by the Biconomy team yet.

## Roadmap and milestones

Decentraland needs to action this as soon as possible to keep running meta transactions.

**Notice that It should be a one-time payment without vesting**

## Abstract

Behavioral Health Group provides interactive, personable and immersive and embodied treatment solution where you’re in the therapeutic experience with the community - patient-led, patient-focused and patient-guided group therapy with CBT and DBT principles.  You're not just looking at it through your computer with your provider - rather, you are interacting with the community with the metaverse. Artificial-Intelligence will optimize the patient journey, allocate groups systematically and enable the digital experience to remain confidential, convenient and cost-effective.

## Description

There is a growing need to train and deploy health care professionals for mental health and behavioral wellness.  Following the COVID-19 lockdowns, many therapist and psychiatrists took advantage of work from home (WFH) lifestyle and don’t appear to be returning to the office as quickly, if they returned at all.

Group therapy helps individuals develop communication skills and socialization skills, and allows clients to learn how to express their issues and accept criticism from others. Group therapy allows individuals to develop self-awareness by listening to others with similar issues.  Group therapy in Decentraland's community provides a low-cost alternative to costly, inaccessible health care and support with a community of individuals to support, validate and listen to other group member's challenges

The group therapy sessions that will be facilitated include:

*   Self-help Group
*   Medication Group
*   Interpersonal Therapy Group
*   Encounter Group
*   Psychodrama Group

Benefits - For one to two hour sessions or ad hoc meet-ups, groups of 20-30 individuals (or more) in each group will benefit from the camaraderie, Sharing Different perspectives, Accountability, Building Confidence, Self-discovery, Transitions and Confidentiality

Connecting people with common treatment goals/plans to categorize individuals with similar behavioral traits, family dynamics, relationships and cultures with optimize the the patient journey and group/provider selection.  The historical data on group can be used to predict future outcomes of new patients with commonalities - which of course, would be confidential, encrypted and masked.

Top Reasons People Do Not Go to Therapy:
""I'd rather talk to my friends.""
""It costs too much.""
""I don't have time.""
""What good is talking going to do?""
""Therapists don't say anything; they just sit there and judge you.""
""Therapists don't really care about you; they do it for the money.""

Decentraland Behavioural Group Therapy rules includes:

*   Maintain Confidentiality
*   Commitment to Accountability
*   Limiting Socializing with Group Members
*   Communicate with Words, Not Actions
*   Participation is optional


## Specification

his research project will be carried out in three phases:

*   Phase 1: Data Collection. Determine qualitative and quantitative analysis survey elements and dimensions.
*   Phase 2: Data Analysis. Perform quantitative and qualitative cost-benefit analysis
*   Phase 3: Recommendations. Produce suggestions on potential costs, benefits and solutions for the DAO community proposal based on the research findings.


## Personnel

With over 10+ years in the healthcare, life science and insurance industry, I and confident our research proposal will identify optimal and effective recommendations, tools and resources for fostering community experience and promoting well-being. I am eager to understand the GAO perspective on supporting mental health in decentraland .

## Description

The WeMeta Builder Tag, a smart item in the Decentraland item shop, is a data aggregation tool to help developers understand what drives engagement in their scenes.

Builders who implement the item into their scenes will have instant access to our dashboard, which presents insights such as foot traffic, active player time, on-scene transactions, and other engagement metrics.

First introduced with the announcement of [WeMeta 1.0](https://medium.com/wemeta/wemeta-launches-the-first-metaverse-analytics-engine-1979a674dafa) - we’ve created preliminary prototypes of this builder tag during MetaFest 2022, and are currently providing analytics for the ETHDenver 2022.

With more conferences, concerts, and communities all making their home in Decentraland - builders will be creating like never before. We want to arm these builders with the best possible tools to successfully construct the most fun and compelling scenes possible. We expect 2022 to the the summer of the Metaverse, and with the right tools, Decentraland will be the epicenter.


## Specification

This project will use the SDK 5.0, Catalyst server API, and other open-source tools created by the Decentraland foundation.

Data is fed into our dashboard, which can be kept private, shared with select parties, or displayed publicly.


## Personnel

## Description

If you have some time, please watch the video proposal cited above.

This grant proposal will guarantee that every land owner will be able to use the following dclconnect features for free at launch. Please note that as time goes on, more and more features will be rolled into the free tier as well. This is simply where we start.

***VideoStreams***

*   Update the video stream on the fly. Control playback in near-realtime for all of the realms.
*   Schedule video(s) to play at a specific time(s) (Throw your own festival!)
*   Apply alpha masks, emissions and other video effects with checkboxes and dropdowns, not code
*   Reposition and scale each with built in controls from within the browser
*   Efficiently apply the same texture to multiple screens
*   Attach a countdown clock to sync with when your video starts
*   Attach audio controls so your users can adjust the volume themselves
*   Attach pre-roll slideshows or videos to play before or after your event

***NFT Galleries / Posters***

*   Add any image to your property by providing a url
*   Reposition and scale each with a built in transform control from the browser
*   Add click events to go to external sites

Visit this grant's forum discussion page to see examples of how to implement this into your existing land.

A smart-item is being planned to allow any dcl builder users to use the service as well. It is on the roadmap! However, it has some unique challenges we have to overcome.


## Specification

Our services require many moving parts in order to operate smoothly. The majority of the infrastructure is already in place. This includes the UI/API/WS and the CI/CD pipeline to easily deploy updates.

Visit this grant's forum discussion page to see a detailed explanation of our business model. (There is a character limit in the initial proposal)

We already open source a significant amount of the tools that we create.
Please check our [npm package](https://github.com/pmacom/dclconnect) for an idea of our future code contributions.

Please note that the public release is still tentatively set for Q1 2022. We will roll out the public free tier version in phases. This way we don’t overwhelm our systems and ensure everyone has a better experience for the long term.

Be sure to check this grant's discussion thread for any updates or clarifications on everything mentioned here. You will also find an updated list of locations that are currently testing our beta!

## Description

We are targeting the African population who's  median age in  is 19.7years. This means  capturing a market while in its infancy. More users creating accounts to make purchases, or visit shops , and in return more impressions for other users and other projects on the Metaverse.

Africa's internet infrastructure is pretty much non existent, or very poor where it exists, we are happy to be one of the few companies building it. What this means for the young people doing business online, it is challenging, also for the few who have managed to conquer the internet they frequently face multiple roadblocks like nonexistent platform integration ie pay pal failure to integrate Mobile money though some progress has been made towards this end it has been long overdue. There is a nonexistent bridge between Credit cards a payment mode dominant in the west. This means restricted capital flows hence a problem resolved by digitizing the business premises  . Its worth noting credit and debit cards are NOT accepted by a large number of residents of the vast continent, but mobile is the dominant form of payment in the order of several fold. Bitsoko is Building its services around mobile money.

We intend to resolve this by allowing our merchants to sell their digital goods and services in the Metaverse thereby eliminating excessive bureaucracy and excessive red tape experienced during the business registration process experienced by many young entrepreneurs starting their entrepreneurship journey.

Capturing the market potential of the Young African continent should be something Decentraland should be interested in. Not only will they visit our shops on the mataverse, they will also visit other locations on Decentraland implying  positive multiplier effects in terms of user visits and Platform adoption, I am sure they will be spending alot too.


## Specification

We intend to hire more developers particularly to develop 3D models for the Metaverse. I believe we will have multiple integrations between the real world shops and those in the metaverse which can end up slowing you down.

Its worth noting Bitsoko has a plot of land on Decentraland though not the desired size  check out.
https://play.decentraland.org/?position=58,-125

we have also been creating content posted on our youtube, check out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwS_yLoa7E

Without a doubt we see the potential of the Metaverse.
Thanks to Bill and Melinda gates foundation, an angle investor does not require much from you, we have been working without any fixed deadlines on the project. This has not stopped us from seeing the project is a success, as we have partnered with other industry leaders including Solana, Algorand, wallet of satoshi, among many others still in the works.

More details about the project timeline check out our Whitepaper on our community page here.

## Personnel

We are a large group of developers but principally led by the co-founders Gibson Juma and Allan Juma more about us check out the whitepaper on our website check out.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qf9Wj53U74oqfvWDa9JO-jejzIXabAle/view


## Roadmap and milestones

We hope to be able to let our users buy and sell digital products and services within 1 year after we receive the grant, thereafter we hope to be able to enable our users sell other goods from the Metaverse using interrogations with google maps and Bluetooth beacons in physical shops in the real world over the next year. thanks to our Networking department Dooca check out https://gateway.bitsoko.org/dooca.html

We hope to report on a trimester basis every 4 months but its good to note we are in a third world country and most things do not run like in a first world country. We have no issue moving elsewhere as we have done during our many visits around the continent, and we have come to like it the way it is, as it has informed our product development heavily. We are developing a service to be used in a market which we already are already part of. Be that as it may, we are very young developers with  a vision for the continent and hope to bring the project to a successful end.

15448,15448,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Develop a Wearable Royalty Fee Calculator,"> by 0x3fb38cee8d0ba7dcf59403a8c397626dc9c7a13b (MorrisMustang)

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

The DAO has voted to redirect the 2.5% royalty fees from wearables sales away from the DAO and to the creators of the wearables. Currently, the DAO Committee does not know the royalties due to each creator and the DAO dApps team is not yet in place to create such a tool.  These fees currently reside in the DAO committee wallet and could be distributed to creators if the accounts payable were known.

Atlas Corporation proposes to develop open source dApp which can be used to determine the total amount of secondary sales for each L2 wearable, wearable collection, and creator, and therefore the royalty fees due from the DAO to each creator.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xe64581f067cfdce58657e3c0f58175e638c30f2b

## Description

The scope of this project is the development of a tool that allows the user to view the number of secondary sales per item, per collection. “Secondary sales” are sales that have occurred on the Decentraland Marketplace.

Any user will be able to access the dApp and view data by either Wearable Collection, Wearable Creator, or Wearable Item.  Data will be presented in an intuitive way such that selecting an item, collection, or creator results in the generation of a table with a list of all secondary sales related to that choice. This table will be viewable within the app and  downloadable by a user in CSV format.

The list of secondary sales transactions will include the following information:

*   The name of the wearable, collection, and creator
*   Date and time the transaction occurred
*   Addresses of the buy and seller (or ENS address if applicable)
*   Transaction amount and currency
*   The transaction hash
*   The 2.5% royalty fee for the transaction

Given that this is to be built as a decentralized application (“dApp”), it can be hosted on IPFS to avoid the need for recurring hosting costs.  We will purchase a domain, register it for 3 years, and forward it to IPFS as a convenience to users.

The application will be made open source using an MIT license and the git repo will be made public.


## Specification

The dApp will make use of the following technologies:

*   Angular/React
*   Bootstrap
*   IPFS
*   The Graph
*   Opensea API
*   Decentraland Catalyst Server
*   Ethereum Naming Service


## Personnel

The wearables royalty calculator will require web3 data mining as well as an intuitive user interface for DAO committee members, wearables creators, and DCL community members to interact with the tool. Atlas Corporation, well versed in this data, analytics and where to find it, is best suited to undertake this challenge.

Development will be led by howieDoin.dcl.eth and MorrisMustang.dcl.eth.

Disclosures:
Atlas Corporation has not created any wearables to date and will not experience a material gain from the existence of this tool.

If you are a front-end developer (react, angular) and would like to participate in this project, [reach out to Atlas Corp in our discord](https://discord.com/invite/zWY6g9vc7g)


## Roadmap and milestones

Development Sprint 1

*   Locate the data
*   Program the extraction of the data
*   Aggregate and transpose the data into its consumable form
*   Conduct interviews with prominent wearable creators to arrive at user stories which will inform the design of the front end dApp.

Development Sprint 2

*   Design and implement user interface to retrieve and render the data
*   Publish dApp to IPFS and route DNS
*   Publish git repo with deployment instructions

## Description

Web3 technology is often disconnected from in real life applications and the people that could benefit from them. Letting preconceived ideas about why web3 is bad block their ability to utilize these technologies, people that could benefit from them the most do not. One example is artists. Without having somebody to talk with artists about the technology and facilitate them embracing this technology, artists are not able to be benefitted from it.
For many artists, creating new NFTs, as well as attracting and maintaining communities that believe in their project is an issue. In Christchurch, New Zealand there is a community of artists (tied to a physical location XCHC) creating a movement in real life through creative events and facilitating spaces in a way that enables community and culture to thrive. However, this community has only started to embrace web3. As a fairly young and small country, the culture has room to improve with their standard of entertainment, nightlife, and creative options in Christchurch and the wider New Zealand. This ultimately leaves many dissatisfied, feeling it lacks the creativity and diversity found in other cities. Without alternatives, the local scene is left with an unhealthy and at times unsafe binge drinking culture, repetitive entertainment, and a socially reserved reputation. Christchurch is especially known for being largely consertive, “closing early”, clique art world, and most “music venues' ' are just bars profiteering off music, leaving most alternative/original music overlooked. Though the XCHC  has been doing great work with artists for 7+ years, this community remains a bit hidden from the wider world (as we’re sure most alternative/independant art spaces can relate). Artists here remain disconnected from the global reach and possibilities enabled by embracing web3 technology, such as NFTs, tokens, and DAOs. However, some are ready to take the next step.
Once people embrace web3, initially it’s often for personal gain and not for public good. Without utilizing this technology for public good, people are unable to see the huge benefits for the world that can come from web3. By embracing web3 through an artistic community and ensuring that the community is guided by doing public good, we can create a more positive narrative than is currently portrayed in many media outlets.


## Specification

These funds will be used as a stepping stone to make New Zealand a global destination for creatives pushing the edges of culture and creative experiences in a way that harmonizes with the whenua (land) and a more sustainable future. Along with that, it will be used to onboard artists into web3 and create a documented onboarding process. As appropriate, existing DAO management tools will be incorporated into this process. When gaps in tooling are discovered, these components will be highlighted and the need expressed to create these tools. For the next Mary Hush and other in real life events, we expect to channel some of this funding to them to facilitate them stepping into new realms of creativity. In order to do this the core team needs to be compensated for the active 'on the ground' development, enabling others to expand into the digital space. Along with that the expansion of the advisory team and formalizing the process towards decentralization will be done. A large portion of the funding will go towards enabling a large number of artists to step into the web3 space and to get a large number of original works from across New Zealand. The XCHC will open a content creators studio to serve 2 purposes: Report and record the progress our members are making into the web3 space and to inspire others to join our community. As well as to start the production of a documentary; similar to the Meow Wolf doco.


## Personnel

T.R. Price |  Web3 Leader
For the past year and a half T.R. has worked exclusively on regenerative finance and building this movement. From that they have had the opportunity to speak alongside organizations like Giveth, Charged Particles and NFTP in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency conference, EthDenver. During that time, they helped many organizations to adopt web3 principles and created various DAOs. Including Return to Green, which has successfully ran the first metaverse event in collaboration with XCHC.


## Roadmap and milestones

## Specification

Part 1 - More about us:

There are Three parts of Unicorn:

UnicornDAO - collects art
UnicornX - creates art
UnicornRiot - activist organizing & onboarding masses

Networks and investors are similar; key investors from the DAO who are the biggest supporters also will be the main investors and partners in UnicornX.

UnicornDAO provides the infrastructure for a feminist and queer cultural revolution on the blockchain - by giving historically undervalued and underrepresented groups tools to empower themselves. 99% of the population is where the culture is, and by helping the 99% to onboard into crypto, we make crypto culture more diverse, fun, and cute. We subvert crypto bro culture and create non-cringe NFT cultural moments, all while building a top network for feminists x queers, and their allies in Web 3, giving birth to an inclusive new-age utopia in the Metaverse.

Key Points regarding our DAO:

*   collectors DAO is dedicated to acquiring and showcasing works of art by women-identified, non-binary and LGBTIQ+ artists

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

Dungeons and Dragons is a game loved worldwide and personally by our development team. To play it, you don't need to have special skills; you can be an adult or a child, which means that there's a considerable amount of potential players. Playing D\&D is captivating. Furthermore, it is no less intriguing to watch others play it, which means that the game can have great success on platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, etc. It means a tremendous advertisement for Decentraland that will bring a lot of new users, and new users equal the advancement of Decentraland.

## Description

The name of our organization is CEN. Link to our website https://cenmodels.com
Each member of our team has been working in game development for many years. We sincerely love games and our work. A year ago, we started to see the potential in Decentraland. We studied the specifics of Decentraland and spent thousands of hours at work. And now, when we know we can create high-quality content, we turn to DAO, to people who believe in the success of Decentraland as much as we do and who, like us, want to participate in its development. We know it is only the beginning of our great journey in improving the Decentraland.

We believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland, which will entail its advancement.

The game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won't be a 100% copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics for several reasons:

*   Specifics of computer games.
*   Limitations of Decentraland.
*   Rules that are easy to understand. Even if you didn't play games like D\&D before.
    Other reasons.

Examples of different game mechanics:

*   A session in D\&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.

*   An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.

*   Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating them themselves.

Expenditure of funds:

*   Purchasing a 2x3 land to place the game on it. To date, the cheapest 2x3 plots are in this price range. People who have made content for Decentraland or have some knowledge about Builder know that acceptable values for triangles, materials, textures, and so on depend on the number of adjacent sections. The 2x3 plot is the minimum size to make beautiful and diverse models of characters, scenery, effects, and other things. (22 000 - 30 000$)

*   Programmer's salary. A programmer is one of the most important specialists in game development. (16 000 - 18 000$)

*   The salary of two 3d artists. Our modelers face a difficult task. They need to meet the scene's limitations but, at the same time, make a lot of diverse, maximally optimized models. (14 000 - 16 000$)

*   Game designer's salary. The game designer will have to think through all the game mechanics and assemble them into a single whole. (8000 - 10 000$)

*   Gamemaster's salary. As I said before, our team is big fans of D\&D, but we decided to call a professional for the role of the gamemaster. The gamemaster will create 2 intriguing game scenarios with many ramifications and a variety of game passing. They will come up with characters, their personalities, the world and the laws by which they live, and much more. (4000 - 5000$)

*   Artist's salary. The artist will draw hero cards, interfaces, backgrounds, and so on. (3000 - 4000$)

*   Sound designer's salary. Audio is a crucial component of the atmosphere for better immersion. (3000 - 4000$)

*   Other expenses. Various services, servers, etc. (5 000$)

*   Marketing. We will cover this amount using our own funds. We need to make a statement! (10 000 - 12 000$)


## Specification

First, the gamemaster and the game designer will create the game's foundation. They'll decide which mechanics to replicate from D\&D, which to change, and which to add. They'll develop 2 adventure scenarios and think through all the dialogues, the variability of actions, characters, etc.
Then they split into two teams:

1.  The gamemaster will start working with an artist, a sound designer, and one of the 3d artists. This team will be responsible for the lore of the game, its appearance, and its sound.
2.  The game designer will work with a programmer and a second 3d artist. Their main task will be to make gameplay and smart objects.
    Even though they'll divide into two other teams, both groups will work closely to ensure that all aspects of the game are compatible.

How we see the final result (in short):
Each player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences. The characters get into some situations and receive a task. For example, players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf. The main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions (""Inspect the tavern,"" ""Approach the tavern and start talking to him""...). Some actions' success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, in ""Strike a stealthy attack at a robber,"" - you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is, for example, 10; you roll the dice, if <10 falls out - you missed, >10 - you hit. In total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players' characters have died.
For a complete understanding, check out D\&D if you don't know what kind of game it is.

Due to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.

15454,15454,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Refund MANA Difference for Wearables Submitted by Creators After the Publication Fee Adjustment Poll and Before its Enactment,"> by 0xe58d9940a395d303e691dbe0676710d9c140101a (Archonomous)

**Summary:** This proposal is in favor of refunding the fee publication cost difference to wearable Creators *only* for wearables submitted *after* the passing of the recent fee publication adjustment proposal, *and before* the adjustment was implemented.

**Overview:** The wearable publication cost was recently adjusted from the original fee of 500 MANA per item to a new $500 USD-pinned fee that updates weekly based on the approximate price of MANA in USD.

https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5

This adjustment was voted on in the DAO (link above) and concluded on *November 7th, 2021*. Following the passing of the proposal, there was a duration of time before the fee change went into effect. This refund proposal would *only* affect wearables submitted during this period of 'limbo', where the changes were approved, but hadn't yet been enacted.

**Proposal:**

*(1)* Establish a time stamp for when the approved wearable publishing fee adjustment went into public affect on the https://builder.decentraland.org/ domain

*(2)* Determine which wearables were published at the original 500 MANA fee *after* the DAO approval on 10:13AM on November 7th, 2021 (snapshot below) and *before* the time stamp established from step (1)

https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.dcl.eth/proposal/QmZ8DGYqLb8yVCmiN8XmnqyYu3BMw8bS23NJWQ2335PQQW

*(3)* Calculate, audit, and issue credit back to affected creators for the price difference according to the newly-approved and implemented system applied to MANA prices at the original time of publication.

For example, if 2 wearables were published by Creator X on November 10th for 1,000 MANA and the price of MANA was $4 USD at that time, then the actual price per the enacted DAO proposal would be 125 MANA ( = $500 USD ) for each wearable. According to this math, Creator X should've paid only 250 MANA rather than 1,000 and would be eligible to receive a 750 MANA refund while still having paid the updated publication fee.

**Purpose:** Why is this important to the Decentraland community? As an involved community member and creator myself, I understand the importance creators have on the growth of this fantastic community and social ecosystem. During this 'limbo' period, although it was no more than a week or so, many creators were dissuaded from publishing content knowing that the fees were going to be adjusted to a lower price.

For some, deadlines do not permit us to be selective about when we submit wearables for review, so for those that were negatively impacted by this short-lived situation, this would be appropriate compensation. Lastly, it should also be stated that this is a unique scenario and that few creators actually submitted during this time, so the total impact is relatively small making this a feasible proposal to take on and address.

Thank you kindly for your time and consideration ~

## NFT Collections Description

**NO NAME STUDIOS** is a digital fashion house based in co-creation.
We join artists, designers and collectors to bring to life our vision for the future of fashion and the metaverse.
Each stage of the production process will be fulfilled by a different contributor becoming a co-creator of **NO NAME STUDIOS**.

We will introduce regular themes for seasonal and capsule collections, extract inspiration from the current pieces in our collections, and at anytime in the process your design could become part of **NO NAME STUDIOS**, the brand.

We are also releasing a [Membership Jacket](https://www.nonamestudios.xyz/join) NFT for our members to wear as a way of showing their support to the brand.


## Motivation

NFTs & Web3 bring a new era in which people are regaining control over their digital presence, their digital identities and ultimately, their digital impact.
**FASHION IS EXPRESSION & COMMUNICATION**, we can all relate to clothing as people.

It wouldn't make sense to us to create a fashion brand without giving our collectors the chance to wear the pieces in the Metaverse, Decentraland being our preferred platform.

I currently wear one outfit while mining at WonderZone, another for my daily wanderings, another for the seasonal or event costume and others to show respect or affiliation when entering certain parcels.

Scrolling through, finding, and clicking on individual wearables can be a chore when changing items regularly.

Currently there has been an increase in 'Pet' designs coming in for approval under the Shoe category. There has been a discussion point raised that these wearables aren't weighted appropriately causing clipping issues and quality issues overall in the space but also can be misleading in the marketplace under the incorrect category.

Committee is opening this decision up to the community to decided if these types of wearables are wanted at the moment and should be approved on a case by case bases OR based off previous DAO proposals another way to implement pets in game should be looked at in a later date through Smart Wearables.

- 'Shoe' category 'Pets' should be approved
- 'Pets' should be on hold till implemented properly
- 'Pets' shouldn't be allowed
- Invalid question/options

15459,15459,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Create a new grant tier to fund the development of play-to-earn games,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**SUMMARY**

An addendum to the [Proposal for a Community Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49) whereby a new grant tier is added, providing $30k/mo for three months for teams making play-to-earn games.

**ABSTRACT**

The community grant framework funds small projects resulting in decent user-generated content. However, the initial tiers are insufficient for larger scope projects. Meanwhile, projects like [Decentral Games](http://decentral.games) were born out of a larger grant that gave them the resources to create an MVP attracting angel and institutional capital.

This new tier would use the DAO to fund pre-existing teams building play-to-earn games in Decentraland. Many such teams exist, but it's up to the DAO and the community to attract them to the platform through funding, support, and guidance.

**MOTIVATION**

The most engaging scenes are mid-sized games. Without a clear path for small teams to finance and launch an MVP of their project on Decentraland, the talent will flock to other metaverses.

Due to the success of Axie Infinity, many teams want to build play-to-earn games. Decentraland is well-equipped to host these, with a fully-fledged SDK, a vibrant community, and an integration with Polygon enabling low-cost, near-instant transfers of digital assets.

With a small investment, the Decentraland community could give rise to numerous games of the caliber of [WonderMine](https://wondermine.wonderzone.io/), Decentral Games, and [Ethermon](https://ethermon.io/).

**SPECIFICATION**

**The new grant category would consist of:**

*   $30k USD (in MANA) / month, for 3 months

**What are play-to-earn games?**

This new tier may only play-to-earn games. The MVPs must:

1.  Be an interactive game
2.  Feature on-chain assets (fungible and/or non-fungible tokens)
3.  Give users the ability to earn on-chain assets by playing the game

After 1.5 months, recipients should provide an MVP: an interactive scene with a functional play-to-earn mechanic. The DAO will review these MVPs, voting on whether or not to execute the third payment.

**Mentorship**

The Decentraland Foundation could curate a list of mentors who would be able to coach recipients through the grant's duration.

**LAND**

The Decentraland Foundation could help pair recipients with LAND owners.

**Applications**

Teams will use an extension of the existing DAO grants form to apply. Additional requirements include:

*   1 page document summarizing the proposed game and its play-to-earn mechanic

This new tier may only be applied for in the last month of each quarter. Applications will only be accepted for one week, once per quarter.

The DAO would vote on each applicant. The three teams receiving the most VP would be selected, with a min of 2 million VP needed.

**Schedule**

*   **Q3 2021**
*   **Aug**
*   Begin accepting applications by 8/26
*   **Sep**
*   Applications close 9/2
*   Winners announced 9/9
*   First payment by 9/13
*   **Q4 2021**
*   **Oct**
*   MVP by end of October
*   DAO votes to continue funding
*   Second payment pending DAO approval
*   **Nov**
*   Third payment

**Reporting**

The DAO Committee and Facilitator would be responsible for monitoring progress, providing public reports every 2 weeks.

**BENEFITS**

*   Attracts talented and experienced teams to Decentraland
*   Creates content that will help to boost Decentraland's attractiveness and retention
*   Attract capital to invest in Decentraland experiences

It does not appear that the DAO has claimed ENS tokens for holding dcl.eth and as such there may be a significant amount of value that can be recognized by the Decentraland DAO. The ENS token claim window is set to close on May 3rd, 2022, so this is a time-sensitive action.

ENS granted ERC-20 tokens to early adopters of ENS depending on quantity and length held. Decentraland was an early adopter of ENS and therefore may have a significant number of tokens to claim.  (Note: it is unclear exactly how many tokens are available as the ENS Claim contract - 0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72 - uses a merkle tree not exposed to the public).

This poll is not intended to govern what to do with the tokens once claimed, which could and should be fodder for future polls and discussion.  The DAO may eventually decide to (a) liquidate tokens and convert to Mana/ETH or other currency for which it has liabilities denominated in, (b) use them to subsidize future ENS needs of the DAO (e.g. dcl.eth comes up for renewal in 2023) or (c) to participate in voting in the ENS DAO.

The intention of this poll is to decide whether they should be claimed before the opportunity to do so expires.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

BECOMING THE FIRST DECENTRALAND NATIVE GREEN ENERGY SUPPLIER
NRverse is aiming at decarbonizing the metaverse through linking it to renewables energy.
For this NRverse is leveraging trusted certificate called Renewables Energy Certificate (generated each time a renewables plan as a windmill or a solar panel is generating electricity) which are tokenized. Then the electricity consumed is evaluated in the different location. This energy calculation should include the end user device, the networking and the servers of the metaverse.
Once the energy is evaluated for each location (granularity of a country), a new NFT is created including the extract of all the related certificate based on the preferred energy type (e.g. wind, solar…).


## Grant size

49,997 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x73c4914A6Ec3E450A52B90bd7fe73929ABC0241a

## Description

The grant will be used for standardizing the current API of NRverse for Decentraland purpose. The ultimate goal would be to offer seamless ""Decentraland Green Option"" or DGO in Decentraland platform for running on green electricity any land, event or user experience. This will mean that each time the DGO is activated each related electricity consumption around the world will be backed by renewable energy.
For doing so we will need to adapt the modules of NRverse to Decentraland specific parameters, we talk about: the calculator and the tokenizer of Renewables Energy Certificate and finally the interface.

1.  Calculator: First, and most important, is to develop the proper calculator modules adapted to Decentraland reality.
    1.1) Evaluation of electricity consumption: The electricity consumption is coming from multiple source: the end user device, the networking, the server of Decentraland.
    For each of these electricity consumption centers, 2 aspects must be evaluated: the location and the amount of electricity during a certain period. In that context the project will develop a specific calculator based on the data from each user (IP address, wallet information, browser...) but also based on Decentraland servers data.

1.2) Listening to Decentraland through SDK: Then the calculator will need to interface with the current Decentraland SDK to evaluate specific land information (e.g. amount of users, wallet information, transaciton happening...)

\-> The result of this should evaluate in real time the worldwide consumption of electricity of the activity on the land (e.g. parcel 45,62 consuming during last hour 30kWh in Germany, 1300 MWh in US, 48 kWh in Brazil...).

2.  Renewables Energy Certificate tokenizer: afterwards the amount of energy that is calculated needs to be extracted from existing Green certificate and tokenized into one NFT.
    2.1) Tokenizer: We need to create the smart contract that will generate the NFT including all the extract from  the different guarantee of origin.
    2.2) Update REC mother contract: We need to implement the logic that will update the smart contract that is containing the different original Renewables Energy Certificate (these are tokenized initially from a PDF coming from trusted issuers all over the world).

3.  User Interface: Second the interface for proposing Decentraland decarbonization services will be built. It includes a portal for organizing event (for corporate for example), the renting of Land. This will include partnership with player like moonbash and MGHDAO.

Ultimately we should have on one side an API that could be offer to anybody that wants to integrate in its land automated decarbonization and on the other side a portal that can help any participant, land owner to initiate the decarbonization of a land (continuously) or a simple event. On top we could include this certification explicitly into some ticket that can take any form of collectible.


## Specification

1.  The first capability of the product has been developed (in beta): upload the pdf Renewables Energy Certificate and transform them into an NFT.
    In that process, the PDF's (from the initial Renewable Energy Certificate - REC) are parsed and data are stored in IPFS, they are then signed via Verifiable Credential thanks to the wallet of the REC's supplier (here metamask). The interface is to upload the data is a simple webpage. The NFT is then generated and transferred tot he wallet of NRverse.
    The current chain used is Ethereum testnet because VC's / DiD are not available on polygon yet but that could be derived easily based  open source code from EWF (https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ew-did-registry) which was used by the team in the past in other projects. There is a full documentation about the API and the process which could be put at disposal.

2.  We need now to create the calculator capability for Decentraland and the related activities. This module will be most likely developed in javascript and will start by the evaluation of ethereum transaction notably based on McDonald calculation (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ethereum-emissions/blob/main/input/extra_data_label_regex.json ).
    For the first version of the calculator the use in Decentraland will be based on benchmark as: laptop/desktop consumption, server consumption and networking from similar game and well as studies. Some details of technology architecture from Decentraland (servers, databases...) would help to evaluate more accurately the energy consumption.
    For accurate calculation of an event or activity on a land the SDK of Decentraland will be used. Some advanced functionalities as conditional access to a parcel will also be used for specific event organisation for example. Another important interface will be the marketplace as certificate could be integrated as metadata of NFT to incentivize the explicit choice of participating to an event based on renewable energy.

3.  The last capability to develop will be the tokenizer module that will aggregate the NFT containing all the extract of the Renewables Energy Certificates will be developed in Polygon.
    The wallet to be used will as well be Metamask and the payment will be managed in Mana.


## Personnel

The project will be elad by Kai & Loic co-founder of NRverse and by their partners from BloxMove, MGH DAO and Lineup.

Kai Schmied is engineer with 10 years of experience in energy including 4 years fo experience in managing blockchain project in the context of the energy sector. He has for example implemented Decentralized Identifiers into Electrical Vehicle for seamless integration into the energy market. He's now NRverse co-founder.

Loic has also a background in energy sector and 10 years of experience from trading, consulting,  and innovation in a major utility. He worked on blockchain project since 4 years and started with for example with the settlement of micro energy transaction. He's now NRverse co-founder

Harry Behrens is CTO at mobility start-up bloxmove (token BLXM)  with deep experience f web3 (was in the past the head of the blockchain factory at Daimler). He's a reknown expert in the eco-system (especially in Germany) and has already focused on the development of the smart contract for the creation and the signature of the NFT of the mother Renewables energy certificate.

Phil Thomsen is blockchain developer working for MGH DAO, startup focusing on metaverse project notably in Decentraland. Phil will contributes to smart contract creating new NFT from the energy consumption calculation.

Dmitriy Gatsura is experienced project manager and has deep experience in web2 and Web3, he will focus on the calculator module and its interaction with the smart contract.

### Summary

Lower the Wearable Publication Fee from 500 MANA to 100 MANA.
Lower curators compensation from 50 MANA to 10 MANA (keeping the 10% ratio).

### Abstract

[This proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) suggested pegging the fee to a USD value. However, setting the fee manually every week is not an option for the SAB, and implementing the automated way will take months.

This proposal aims to be simple, clear, and easily enacted today. Just change the publication fee to a new value: 100 MANA.

### Motivation

*   The price of MANA went from 0.7 to 5 USD.
*   Reduce the entry barrier for new creators.

### Specification

The Security Advisory Board should update the fee using their multisig.

They need a clear proposal making the fee explicit and having sufficient VP to enact it. The threshold is not set, but we should aim for 4VP or higher.

- Set fee at 100 MANA
- Keep it as is

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Keep Polygon transactions free](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3e828730-caf6-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)

## Summary

The DAO will subside polygon transactions for Decentraland users


## Abstract

The DAO will fund the Gas tank for Polygon meta transactions in order to keep a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry for publishing, listing, bidding, and buying wearables in exchange for MANA between others.


## Motivation

This is a follow-up from this [past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7af34c90-5d1e-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7), where a Grant was given by the DAO to keep Polygon transactions in Decentraland free for all its users. Free transactions mean that the Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction (in Polygon) they perform while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera.

Decentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.

The way Biconomy works is by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**


## Specification

Up until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth.

It’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp.

The Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and the flywheel could keep spinning: better UX > > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.

Note that to avoid potential attacks or abuse situations where the gas tank could be emptied, claiming/buying wearables for free or less than 1 MANA is not going to be covered by the meta-transactions model.


## Impacts

This will impact the whole Decentraland users


## Implementation Pathways

The DAO will need to fund the Biconomy Gas Tank


## Conclusion

If this proposal closes and the result is ""YES"",  the DAO Committee will be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.

In the physical world, governments can tax land.  They do this impart to incentivize land owners to make productive use of land and not just sit on it.  They also do this to raise revenue for general operations, which could be useful to DCL.

Decentraland has allowed us all to connect in a new way, and although the ability to talk, type, and discover in Decentraland has evolved substantially, we are still very limited in decentralized movements.

Problem:
Currently, all movements (emotes) avatars can do depend on those movements (/emote tik, tektonik, etc) being added by Decentraland’s Development team. This prevents the “expressiveness” of the community from leading the charge and bringing amazing things to the ecosystem. As the wearable market flourished once opened to the community by removing the centrality of wearable creation/publishing.

Solution:
Just as we have done with wearables, we should open nft emotes for creators to load their .fbx and other standardized movement files to be used by their avatars. This in turn would not only add a whole other dimension for creators to utilize, but it would also allow for additional revenues to return to the DAO from submission fees and royalties. This would add a new class of asset for Decentraland’s current and future users.

Importance of movement:
Science shows that a majority of how we communicate is through body language, and without allowing the community of creators to inject their creativity through that medium we are holding our users back in the very area we are trying to open to them; deep and meaningful ways to connect and communicate with others online.

Case Study to Demonstrate Feasibility:
Some barriers which have limited this from being a possibility is the access to movement data, which often is not very simple to access whether due to cost or proprietary reasons. For this reason it has been easier to have the movements hard coded, and as special surprises through the year.

With the expansion of uses within the web3 space, a new company MetaMoves has published NFTs which give the holder owner of the actual movement data, with standard files such as .fbx. They are already utilizing this to animate other avatars such as MeeBits, and the same could be realized for Decentraland Users. It would allow us to carry into Decentraland an important part of our identity. That goofy wave or dance move; if you don’t speak I may think you are shy, but if you stop moving… I’ll call an ambulance! Movement has a deep connection to being alive, let’s liberate movement and help Decentraland accomplish something no other metaverse has before.

- Yes - I would like for the Decentraland Developement Team to prioritize building a UI/UX for creators to load in their own movements. 
- No - Continue to limit any emote creation/publishing to Decentraland’s own developers

## Abstract

We are presenting a new casual game for Decentraland, easy to understand for all users. It features social aspects, multiplayer gameplay. Engaging players through XP progress, avoiding pay to win as much as possible.

We are Pablo and Eibriel, with a long trajectory on Decentraland projects including multiplayer experiences. Pablo ended, after 9 years, previous job in mid May 2021 focusing 100% on content around Decentraland and Eibriel is doing it for quite time, being this project our main focus right now, working on it full time.

This is our biggest project till date, that started cooking before last GameJam 2020 on paper and drafts, selected among an amount of different project ideas. We have been working on it for some weeks now.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xE8643B09CF5A016AA2F1c2E9371dcEAdD362BB00

## Description

This could be one of the most complete gaming experiences till date on Decentraland, helping users to stay connected with high social features, to engage in community interaction and have fun without need to be a pro-gamer user.

The funds will be used mostly to cover the work we can&rsquo;t or that we are not so productive at, like graphic design, marketing, audio, business infrastructure etc. Also to help prevent burning our savings, allowing us to keep focused on the project.


## Specification

Applying Agile methodology we have defined a roadmap with a first playable prototype by mid-end of July where a player can start feeling the game. This is already in the works, and we are already experiencing a good playability experience.

Regarding technical resources, the game requires a real time multiplayer server (sockets) as well as a big database.

To keep the game as a surprise, but at the same time be able to report the status of the progress, we will be sharing the progress with members of the Decentraland Foundation and selected members of the community.

—Designers: Responsible for the appearance design for clothing, buildings or other Decentraland products;

—Modelers: Complete the modeling work of the specific product based on the manuscript provided by the designers;

—Advisers: Participate in the whole process of product design and development, providing suggestions for designers and modelers to adopt;

—Proposers: DAO members can offer proposals for Decentraland's virtual works and the development of DigiFunDAO. Proposals can proceed to the formal stage after receiving enough votes during the presentation stage;

—Decision makers: DigiFun product holders (POAP, clothing, etc.) can become decision makers. The official listing of products on self requires the votes by DAO members, and will be adopted only when a certain percentage of votes will be reached (also votes for a better product, letting everyone get involved in building a better future for DCL)

Solutions for potential problems

1.  When the DAO organization expands, if there is a conflict between the interests of some DAO members and the overall interests of the project (for example, PoW miners prevent PoS improvement), then it can be solved by POAP dividends/buyback or destruction to ensure that the overall benefits of the project can be returned to DAO in some way.
2.  Regarding governance enthusiasm, we will motivate DAO members by airdropping NFT for the governance, but will not make promise to the encouragement, to avoid the phenomenon of click farming.
3.  Stability of governance. The increase of weight requires certain plans to ensure the stability of overall voting. A linear mechanism similar to DeFI will be adopted to ensure the stability of decision-making system.

15475,15475,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Would you support funding Decentraland community operations through loans on Fringe Finance?,"> by 0xb77af992749615e989acb2ce3d40f748f07b8de8 (Hardcore#8de8)

[Fringe Finance](https://app.fringe.fi)  is offering the Decentraland DAO to use MANA tokens as collateral to borrow up to $10,695,406 in USDC to be utilized at the discretion of the DAO.

**Abstract:**

[Fringe Finance](https://app.fringe.fi) is a decentralized money market designed to unlock the capital spread in crypto assets regardless of their capitalization and supported networks.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/760/1\*uHSSawc1I5qg60VP-lldNQ.png)

Recently Fringe Finance [announced](https://fringefinance.medium.com/were-listing-decentraland-s-mana-on-august-5th-d29de2304e20) that on the 5th of August MANA token will be integrated as a collateral asset allowing holders to access USDC loans.
The benefits for MANA token holders and the Decentraland DAO are described below.
Motivation:
Borrowing against MANA to fund the DAO’s operations instead of selling benefits all the holders by removing selling pressure.
The Decentraland DAO borrowing against its MANA holdings, rather than selling them, both signals alignment and better align its interests with those of MANA holders.
USDC is one of the most trusted stablecoins on the market with deep liquidity.

Fringe Finance announced the integration of MANA on the 5th of August MANA as a collateral asset to borrow USDC.

Fringe Finance provides added utility for all holders of MANA including the Decentraland DAO by allowing them to borrow USDC against their MANA.

The MANA community can utilize borrowed USDC funds elsewhere in the crypto ecosystem without the necessity to sell MANA tokens.

**Specification:**

MANA has been assigned a loan-to-value ratio of 43% on Fringe Finance. This means that for every $1000 worth of MANA collateral a $430 loan can be taken.
The current borrowing interest is 2.34%/year, but the rate is currently floating(\*).
The borrowing limit for MANA on Fringe Finance is currently $10,695,406.

**Steps:**

Deposit sufficient MANA token collateral on the Fringe Finance platform from the treasury.
The corresponding USD-denominated line of credit is issued.
Up to $10,695,406 USDC loan can be taken and used by the Decentraland DAO.
Announce the taken loan on social media and official blog. If the loan will not take place announce the additional utility of the Fringe Finance integration for the community.

**Benefits:**

Reduced selling pressure on the market
Signals the additional utility to MANA holders in that they can access stablecoin loans
Fund DAO operation by locking MANA tokens and increasing cash flow

**About Fringe Finance:**

We‘re partners with projects such as Polygon, Chainlink, REN, Elrond, Bancor, IoTeX, Lido, and others.

Fringe Finance has twice been audited by respected [firms](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf).

On Fringe, borrowers deposit collateral against which they may take out loans in a select set of the most liquid and reliable USD stablecoins. The resultant benefit for borrowers on Fringe Finance is that they have access to deep, unfragmented capital pools from which to borrow. This significantly reduces both the interest rate slippage they can expect when taking out a loan, in addition to reducing interest rate volatility over the course of their loan.

Fringe’s depth and concentration of lending capital liquidity also benefit lenders, as it similarly reduces the interest rate slippage they can expect to experience when depositing capital as well as reducing fluctuations in the interest paid on their capital. This indirectly benefits borrowers, as lending on Fringe becomes more attractive, resulting in more capital being available at lower interest rates.

An additional indirect benefit for borrowers is that Fringe’s platform employs empirically sound custom algorithms to determine lending parameters so as to maximize platform stability. This attracts lenders to the platform and therefore results in greater capital available for borrowers.

15480,15480,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Manage Bounty program for vulnerability reports,"> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[Set up a bounty program for vulnerability reports](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c8c8ee20-fee5-11ec-8f44-ef1722f0509f)

## Summary

Request the DAO to cover the payment of the rewards and grant the Decentraland Foundation to manage them as the proposal state.


## Abstract

As the DAO owns the smart contracts and manages the development of the protocol, we are requesting to cover the rewards needed for every vulnerability found in the Decentraland bounty program. The Decentraland foundation is committed to triage, answering, and fixing every disclosure received. Every payment will be published publicly.


## Motivation

Bug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to discover and disclose potential vulnerabilities in projects’ smart contracts and applications, thereby protecting projects and their users. For their good work, security researchers receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability, as determined by the project affected.

Why have a bug bounty program at all? In 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Web3 community over $238m, and bug bounties can prevent those hacks from happening. Bug bounty programs surface vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before they get exploited in malicious hacks that destroy projects and ruin reputations.


## Specification

As members of the Security Advisory Board (SAB), we hereby request the DAO to approve and fund the bounty program and due to its nature and limited execution capabilities, delegate to the Decentraland Foundation the ability to respond to any vulnerability disclosed through the program. That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to doing the triage and answering the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed. So basically when a payment has to happen due to a valid report under the program, the Decentraland Foundation will inform DAO with case #, the recipient wallet address, and the amount to be paid and also, shall contact the SAB in order to fix the vulnerabilities disclosed.

The program is composed of different threat levels and topics:

**Smart Contracts**

High					       **Up to USD 500 000**

Medium			                **Up to USD 20 000**

Low					        **USD 1 000**

**Websites and Applications**

Critical				       **USD 18 000**

High				               **USD 6 000**

Medium				       **USD 3 000**

Low					       **USD 1 000**

Payouts are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **MANA and USDT**, with a minimum of 20% to be done in USDT.

The program is not tied or attached to any third party but the Decentraland Foundation will use them and their expertise and platforms to help administrate the program. Therefore and after a deep initial analysis, the SAB has selected and recommended the Decentraland Foundation to start the bounty program using [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/).

The Decentraland bounty program can be found [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/decentraland/).

The DAO will publish each payment made for every reward.


## Conclusion

The idea is to keep Decentraland safe and secure for every user. The DAO will provide the funds while the Foundation will manage the disclosures accordingly

Based off an earlier proposal by a fellow community member, https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1c4bd950-1296-11ec-ac84-77607720a240

All DCL names are subdomains of the DCL.eth domain. DCL implements a smart contract to mint a corresponding NFT for each subdomain and allow the NFT owner to claim the subdomain (in case of transfers). These NFTs are then used to identify if a user owns the name or not, and if they do, they can set it as their Avatar Name.

With a few changes, DCL can allow subdomains of the dcl names to be minted as NFTs and integrate them into the naming system to allow names like xxx.name (the corresponding ENS subdomain would be xxx.name.dcl.eth)

The Name Registry smart contract is already designed in such a way that it could theoretically work to mint subdomains for any base domain (or subdomain). Implementing this change would just require a slightly modified version of this contract to exist along with the base names. NFTs generated through new smart contracts can then be included in the naming system.

Note: if someone wants to enable subdomains for their name, they would have to transfer ownership of the name to a smart contract.

- Allow subdomain names for DCL names to be registered
- Do not allow it

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Double is an NFT rental platform that aims to match the owners and users in gamefi or metaverse.

And the land rental in Decentraland will be the first type of asset we support to be listed and rented in the marketplace.


## Grant size

10,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xc9BEdB2173FD480716Cb140360f2aDa9CfC5451c

## Description

With the rental model, we can lower the threshold to build and contribute, which will attract more users onboard and have fun in Decentraland.

As a lender, you can lend your land and receive the rent as your income. As a builder, you can rent a piece of land to build your headquarters, club, gallary or anything else you want to.

We believe that it will help the builder find a better way to create and build DCL into a place full of vitality.

15485,15485,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Create a new smart contract for Decentraland subdomains to be NFT’s,"> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (BoredApe)

Decentraland names are minted under .dcl.eth top level domain. When you claim (mint) a name it is displayed as yourname.dcl.eth However it is also possible to further claim (mint) names from yourname by using the https://app.ens.domains/ app

As a test I have successfully minted surprise name from kinder DCL name. This name now reads surprise.kinder. You can see it from this link below

https://app.ens.domains/name/surprise.kinder 3

Right now this name is a token only. For it to become an ERC721 NFT a new smart contract will need to written. This will make it usable within the Decentraland platform.

Why this proposal is important?

Many existing and new platforms and projects are now coming into DCL. Decentraland Metaverse is an excellent place for brand recognition, awareness, adoption, marketing, advertising. It even works for individuals and small teams.

Slowly we are seeing the formations of guilds, groups, teams, friends, families, fans and much more. The idea behind this new proposal is only the make things more fun, exciting while adding another utility to names.

Each event is just getting bigger and better with more players coming in. The most recent CocaCola event was totally epic. So I thought to my self wouldn’t it be fun if the CocaCola team members all had names? for example imagine they are named diet.cocacola, zerosugar.cocacola, vanilla.cocacola and so on. Straight away you would know who the official representatives are because of their name. Many other example can be given. However it does not have to be a company or a business’s. It can be fan based groups. Let’s say a group of females are super into Bratz and they can have the names meygan.bratz, yasmin.bratz and cloe.bratz.

Subdomains can be minted directly from ens domain website. Although all the names are NFT’s the subdomains on the other hand are only tokens. For the subdomains to become NFT’s a new smart-contract has to be created.

This will allow all subdomains to be easily used, transferred, traded just like any other NFT

Main usage for dcl subdomains

*   Guilds, Groups
*   Friends, Families
*   Businesses, Brands
*   Platforms, Projects
*   Games, Events
*   Giveaways, Prizes

## Abstract

Breaking or setting a Guinness World Record is one of the best and smartest ways to raise awareness for a brand, a company, a product, a game, a community, and why not a metaverse. I work in the entertainment business for 14 years. I am the owner and manager of 2 dancing schools in Greece and I am currently a holder of 2 Guinness World Records and I led in total 5 successful record attempts. All 5 projects were about the number of dancers like Largest Bachata Dance (840 Dancers Kalamata Greece) Largest Kuduro Dance (540 Dancers Patras Greece) . Also, I work with gaming since 2002 as i own internet cafes from the time of Counterstrike 1.5 and i am an HC Gamer myself. What I want to create is the Largest Online Party in Decentraland.


## Grant size

25,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

15487,15487,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Proposal for a Community Grants Framework,"> by 0x8cff6832174091dae86f0244e3fd92d4ced2fe07 (frami)

A proposed framework for grants that may be requested through the DAO. The goal is to ensure that grants have the scope, goals, planning, and appropriate funding needed to be successful.

**Abstract**

One of the features to be added to the Decentraland DAO is community grants. These grants will use MANA owned by the DAO to help fund teams and/or individuals who want to create features or content for Decentraland. However, it is important to allocate the DAO's MANA judiciously for several reasons:

1.  The DAO's MANA fund is limited
2.  There are limits to what can realistically be built within the Decentraland platform
3.  It is common ground that it is in the community's best interest to maintain the ability to fund a range of projects over a long period of time

To maximize the impact of the DAO's funds and to ensure the DAO gives funds to projects most likely to succeed (thus adding value to Decentraland for the entire community), grants should be constrained in size and category to make it easier for the community to review and vet proposals.

**The proposed grant categories are:**

*   Community
*   Platform contributor
*   Gaming

**The proposed initial grant tiers are:**

*   $500 - $1500 USD in MANA, one-time payment
*   $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA, one-time payment
*   $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, up to a 3 month vesting contract with a one month cliff

**Specification**

For a full description of this proposed Grants Framework, [please see this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDzmJTiDmr2rhIbSABUmuag0\_poddC7tt192M-3ZitA/edit?usp=sharing).

**For**

The Decentraland Foundation will implement these grant categories and tiers into the DAO proposal submission process by means of pre-designed forms. Only grant applications within the above described framework will be funded through the DAO.

**Against**

Do not use the grants framework described in this proposal to limit funding provided to projects through the DAO. (Note: if this proposed framework is rejected by the DAO, an alternative framework may be proposed pending feedback and discussion within the community.)

15489,15489,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Catalyst Protocol Definition,"> by 0x5e5d9d1dfd87e9b8b069b8e5d708db92be5ade99 (Paralax24#de99)

The Catalyst API has been evolving and adding different functionalities, endpoints and parameters as needed by the evolving platform requirements. Because of this needs, some changes while good decisions at the moment to unblock features, were not thought holistically or now they may be causing too much unneeded Data Transfer cost or have room for performance improvement for the Catalysts core processes like Bootstrapping and Synchronization.

Decision
After reviewing the Catalyst API we defined a set of changes to clean up and close a first clean version of the Catalyst Protocol. The changes that will be described below will enable us to:

*   Reduce Data Transfer cost by only narrow down the response bodies to return needed information
*   Reduce public API complexity by hiding endpoints that are only intended for troubleshooting, this will also reduce hits to endpoints that should not be used externally
*   Improve the Catalyst bootstrapping and synchronization time by reducing the amount of request and information received for the synchronization
*   Contribute to the Platform scaling and support of more concurrent users
*   Do a more efficient uses of the DB
*   Open the door to create new Catalyst implementation based on this protocol definition and with this, help us to create a more robust Protocol

List of API changes:

Secure endpoints won't be part of the Catalyst Protocol definition but we will keep them as internal troubleshooting tools, these endpoints will require a key in order to be used. Those endpoints that will be removed from the Protocol but remain available for internal use are listed under the SECURE section

Current API https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/
Branch with API changes https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst-api-specs/tree/api-refinement

*NEW ENDPOINTS*
These endpoints will help to replace the most request information to the /deployments
/content/pointers/{entityType}
Given an entity type (scene, wearables) this endpoint returns the list of all the pointers paginated
/content/pointers/{entityType}/history?pointer=0,0\&pointer=1,1
Given a list of pointers of the specified entity type, returns the history of deployments

*RENAMED*
From /lambdas/contentv2/scenes	  to       /lambdas/content/scenes

*SECURE*
Removed from the public API and Protocol definition but kept for internal use
/content/deployments
/contents/{hashId}/active-entities
/content/failed-deployments
/lambdas/crypto/validate-signature
/comms/islands
/comms/islands/{islandId}
/comms/peers

*DEPRECATED*

Yes since 500 Mana Wearable Submission fee is now high thanks to gov printing money, zuck and massive new interest in metaverse (last part pretty cool) 500 Mana now equals like $1,500 to $1,700. Several of us did not mind paying it because we love the support of the DCL team and also were investing in our wearable venture. We also don't mind some of the proposals to lower the fee or tie to USD or DAI to keep point of entry lower so people can also sell there wearables lower. However for of us that paid when high also deserve to be refunded the difference of the new price being lowered to if this passes.

If the price always drops every-time someone submits a new proposal ask yourself what is ever the point of paying/investing early if the price always goes down in price. Risk in early innovation will always = punished not rewarded

We don’t sell our wearables like “ ( first 5 buyers pay 500 mana) after that only $2 each!” Who the hell would wanna be first 5 buyers. Even if I was Billy Mayes himself

So our proposal is we either keep 500 mana or lower price for wearable submission and refund the difference to all paid the higher price. If anyone not on board then they are ok with early payer discrimination and that is not a decentraland

-  lower price for wearable submission and refund the difference to all paid the higher price
- keep 500 mana

Since the hot item seems to be prices pegged to a USD equivalent.  Id like to propose a poll to see how many people would like to see names be minted at a equivalency of 100 usd in mana. Why 100 usd you ask? My answer is a name gives 100 vp so I pegged it to 1 for one with its vote power in return.  The prices seem to go up and down and i can remember paying 300+ usd for names. I think pegging a stable amount would help maybe bring in more people willing to buy their names. Also give people a target for acquisitioning.  This could also be changed later to a different cost but I think due to the 100 vp this is a fair market value. Would love to hear community thoughts and opinion's. Also remember names are tradable nft's and usable as sub domains.

- Change to 100 usd equivalent in mana

15492,15492,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should Sango be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?,"> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, Sango, 3D Artist and wearable creator from Metazoo was nominated:

[https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=item\&section=wearables\&isMap=false\&isFullscreen=false\&vendor=decentraland\&page=1\&sortBy=recently_listed\&onlyOnSale=true\&search=metazoo](https://market.decentraland.org/accounts/0x943d99cefa84b247b679d2b7cce17c7c93e6587b?assetType=item\&section=wearables)

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.  This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **\[DAO approved a proposal] (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

15493,15493,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Allow the DAO to recover lost assets,"> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc

### Summary

This proposal aims to standardize a process for the very exceptional case that a user requests Decentraland’s DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES owned by an account to which the original owner has lost access to.

### Terms

*   **Abandoned LAND**: LAND that has not been used in any way since the terraform auction. Use includes deployments, transfers, marketplace listings (including unfulfilled), and the owner of the account signing into the marketplace.

*   **Lost Assets**: LAND and/or ESTATES held by an account where the associated private key has been lost. Does not include LAND or ESTATES transferred to an account through accident or theft, or LAND that has been abandoned.

*   **Claimant**: a user with claim to Lost Assets.

### Abstract

A user who has lost access to a private key and therefore to all LAND and ESTATES held by their account must have a way to present her case to the DAO in order to regain control of her Lost Assets. The DAO can not use this procedure to reclaim abandoned LAND. The DAO can only use this procedure to recover Lost Assets owned by a user who has lost their account’s private key.

The claimant needs to present evidence beyond reasonable doubt about the incident to prove herself the rightful owner of the lost account. The case will be published on the forum and will be reviewed by a Judicial Committee to ensure it complies with *the requirements (see below)*.

If the case is approved by the committee, the claimant will be granted permission to **deploy new content** on the Lost Assets owned by the lost account but **won’t be able to transfer the LAND and ESTATES for a period of time (12 months)**.

During that period of time, the lost account and the DAO will retain the power to revoke deployment permissions of the claimant. After that year the claimant will be able to transfer their assets freely.

### Motivation

Private keys will be lost and some users will fail in their efforts to protect their assets. In case of loss, if enough proof is presented to the DAO the rightful owner should regain access to her LAND and ESTATES tokens. See [Ethen’s case](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/vote-yes-to-return-lost-land-and-set-the-precedent-for-this-moving-forward/296) as the first example.

Today it is technically possible to make a secure setup to overcome the loss of a key. For example by granting co-ownership to a second account or a multisig shared with friends.

However, given the current undeveloped state of the user experience for Ethereum, Web 3.0, and cryptocurrency in general with regards to advanced key management schemes, this kind of setup requires high technical knowledge from users.

This proposal aims to help those who fall into misfortune by providing a last hope, a journey to recover a lost account.

### Specification

The ERC721 standard defines the concept of approvedForAll; ​​an owner-wide role that can transfer any ERC721 of the owner, and also set UpdateManager roles. [See roles recap](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/a-recap-land-ownership-deployment-permissions/12).

This proposal requires updating the LAND and ESTATE smart contracts to add a mechanism that allows the DAO to set the co-owner of a lost account.

The update will be a new method on the registry that allows the DAO to set the approvedForAll role to an arbitrary address.

The new co-owner will be a smart contract that will function as an escrow of the assets first giving the claimant permission to update land and estates and after twelve months the claimant will be able to transfer the assets.

During a period of twelve months, the lost address and the DAO will keep the power to revoke the contract, an action that will return the LANDs and ESTATEs to the original owner.

The proposed changes to the LAND and ESTATE Registry are [here](https://github.com/decentraland/land/pull/152/files). The intermediary contract is still pending and an external audit is still required.

### Application Requirements

To kick off this process the user needs to present her case publicly on the forum including all evidence possible. The case will be reviewed by the Judicial Committee.
Following a proposed guideline of requirements:

*   The “lost” address must have a minimum of six months of inactivity.
    *   Specifically, no executed transactions by this wallet, either signing or sending txs.
    *   If the claimant has received anything inadvertently, this is not an indication that they have access to this wallet (air drops, scam coins, etc. )
*   The user provides a description of how the key was lost.
*   Objective proof of ownership, some examples are:
    *   Private messages signed with the “lost” key.
    *   LAND description linking to claimant’s personal info.
*   Two witnesses testify on behalf of the user (over video).
    *   Character witness: Familiar with claimant’s cripto-goins (friend, work colleague).
    *   Expert witness: Developer or Community Member with technical experience.

Ultimately it will be the Judicial Committee's decision to approve or reject the application. In case of doubt (by any member) the application will be rejected.

### Judicial Committee

The three recommended committee members proposed alongside this new implementation are:

*   Carl Fravel - Technology Executive, Member of many DCL districts.
*   Peter Derrick - DCL “Bartertown” estate owner and long-time contributor.
*   Yemel Jardi - Software Engineer and early contributor to DCL.

It is suggested and proposed that these committee members remain active for an initial period of 6 months before opening a poll to replace or renew them.

### Main Concerns

**Can the DAO reclaim abandoned LAND?**

No, this proposal does not address the issue of abandoned land, this is for future consideration.

**Is this too much power to the DAO?**

The process needs to be started by the claimant and the decision is made by the Judicial Committee. The DAO should not use this method for other cases without a formal community vote.

**How can the DAO prevent fraud?**

The address must be inactive for a period of six months and in case of approval, the claimant won’t be able to sell the land for a period of a year, giving time to the presumed “lost key” to appear and stop this process.

### Alternatives

*   Form the Committee but don’t upgrade the contracts. Give the DAO a budget to buy land and return it to the claimant.

*   Upgrade the contracts but don’t form the Committee, just let the DAO to judge case by case.

*   Do nothing to help users that lost keys and handle the land as if were abandoned.

### Vote

**For**: Upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.

**Against**: Do not upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.

**Other**: Revise the structure and terms of the proposal and publish a revised version.

- For: Upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets
- Against: Do not upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Renovi is a niche NFT marketplace and content creation studio for architecture/3D design.

Our goal is to allow DCL-compatible NFT assets that are on marketplaces to be available on the DCL builder.

This will allow creators to monetise their works, even if they do not own land while users can purchase/utilise the assets on their respective parcels.

Similar to how wearables grew in popularity as seen during fashion week, we believe that the next step would be for buildings/furniture.

This was validated by an ever-growing community of builders who participated in the https://topmetaversebuild.com which was hosted in DCL, One Time Square of which the foundation donated a land parcel as part of the prizes (https://bit.ly/3OZjKRv).

## Description

The ultimate question Renovi is trying to answer is “Who is building the Metaverse?”

""Metaverse does not come from any industry giant, but the crystallisation of millions of people's co-creation,"" says Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. This is what DCL set out to do, co-create the Metaverse, but believe there can be more contributors to the Metaverse puzzle.

Our guiding compass is to encourage architecture in the Metaverse and to develop a new economic model for architects/3D designers in the process of architecting the Metaverse. With an active influx of high-quality buildings to DCL there will be more experiences for users rather than vast areas of barren land. We are also confident that monthly user adoption and user-generated events will also rise. For such a task to occur we need to revolutionise the way the marketplace, builder and SDK currently operate.

Renovi believes that to build further, more complex and enticing experiences within DCL the correct stakeholders need to be rewarded for creating. This implies that high-quality, professional architects/3D designers but also upcoming talent needs to be interested and more importantly motivated to create for the Metaverse.

Architects/3D Designers can now break their real-life moulds and find new monetary avenues by leveraging their efforts for exponential development through DCL.

Following on from our successful poll “Decentraland scenes as NFTs: Should scenes also be NFTs that can be sold within the Decentraland marketplace?” (Link: https://bit.ly/3P1dybU) we have taken onboard the feedback from the various stakeholders and revised our approach to offer a better solution.

We aim to create cross-platform compatible 3D asset NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL. We want to create a seamless experience in which a creator can upload a 3D asset in Renovi Marketplace (or any other marketplace) and put it for sale. Consequently the buyer of that 3D asset now an NFT will be able to navigate directly from the marketplace to the DCL builder in which they can find the asset as a new asset pack. Within a few clicks, they should be able to place the asset on their land and if further alterations are required they can download the scene so it can be altered on the SDK.

To achieve this we will integrate the Renovi marketplace to DCL by building part of the DCL API links so that 3D assets are compatible and can be presented in the builder as long as they belong to the respective user’s wallet. This will enable us to automate the current procedure. Currently, the buyer of a 3D asset needs to download it and reupload it to the builder while at the same time there is no clear way of ensuring they are the owners of that building as an NFT. We will offer a single, simple streamlined solution for DCL.

As part of giving back to the community, we will also need to ensure that there is API compatibility between DCL products and Renovi Marketplace or any other marketplace. We want to make it possible that everyone who purchases a 3D asset as an NFT that is compatible with DCL can connect their wallet, navigate to the builder of DCL and be able to find the respective 3D asset as an external asset pack that can be placed on their land.

Our goal is to automate the implementation pipeline, and indirectly add buildings as NFTs into DCL by opening up the builder and its capabilities to a wider audience.

## Specification

How can we achieve this?

To achieve a technical specification of this magnitude, we will need to carefully craft and technically architect each stage of our infrastructure and execution. This will entail developing an API, which we will label as the “industry standard” prototype for interoperable communication. Developing a standard will be subject to outlining in full, all parameters that are currently present within DCL technical ecosystem. E.g. project name, parcel type, parcel dimensions, file type, price, chain, triangles, materials, meshes, bodies, entities and textures etc.

This will be followed by documentation, enabling a user to educate themselves on creating GET/POST requests to and from the Renovi and DCL ecosystems. All API calls will be open and provided to the public to interact with. We will allow users to obtain authentication mechanisms in the form of bearer tokens, from us, which can be invoked/revoked at any time, to facilitate the usage of our API. Upon integration and authentication, with industry standards, the user will be able to interact with the API to either fetch, embed, post, and/or utilise all the parameters available for each Metaverse asset.

At MVP stages, these interactions will bypass through a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) built on NodeJS and/or equivalent, as this enables us to interact with the blockchain using web3 infrastructure. Once an API request is authenticated and a user has posted their metaverse asset for approval, their user ID, wallet ID and asset ID will be manually (at first) approved and sent to the DCL builder. The CMS will enable any admin to utilise the CRUD convention (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) along with import/exporting any assets needed, to open communication lines between the CMS and the DCL builder. This could function in a similar way to approving DCL wearables.

https://github.com/mostmojo

In the last decade, Jacob has led teams in the U.S and U.K and has worked alongside developers of the likes of TransferWise & Revolut.

He's been a Technical Advisor to Blockchain and Private Equity startups and has led tech teams with clients of the likes of Nike, Vodafone, Adidas, National Lottery, Gordon Ramsay and UCL.

He has been a fellow educator for Brixton-based code camps and global leading tech boot camp Le Wagon, before founding Mojo Digital of which he has a client base of over 300 web applications/sites to date before co-founding Renovi.

Additionally, he’s been on the board of Coin Mara, an African Startup as a Technical Architect, that raised over $30M from Coinbase Ventures, Huobi and more.


## Roadmap and milestones

Create a cross-platform connection for 3D assets that are NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL.

Rebuild part of Decentraland’s existing builder so that 3D Assets that are NFTs can flow directly from marketplaces to the DCL builder.

40K 4 months

Build an API layer of communication enabling the user to transfer NFTs from a marketplace to a DCL builder.

34K 3 months

Ensure API compatibility between DCL products, Renovi Marketplace but also other marketplaces such as Opensea. This in the future can allow Decentraland products to act as a dynamic RSS feed, enabling any NFTs bought and validated with the category “Buildings” (for example) to be showcased within DCL’s builder.

26K 2 months

A user that uploads a GLTF file for example on Renovi Marketplace can currently input “Compatible on Decentraland”, this would set a boolean value to True, and ping a GET request to the Decentraland API. Upon request, a dashboard can be created for both Decentraland and RNVI admins, to approve and therefore port over any assets from RENOVI to Decentraland with the click of one button (after setting the boolean values to TRUE).

20K 3 months

Implement security measures for API endpoints and documentation, so both parties can access a JSON-like structure for the NFTs and open communication lines for API calls

Total estimated cost: $120K
Total estimated delivery time: 12 months

We believe that our project complies with the Decentraland Content Policy, Terms of Use, and Code of Ethics.

## Abstract

Sandstorm connects the top brands with Metaverse builders. Independent artists create profiles and build portfolios on the Sandstorm platform. As brands enter the Metaverse and look to hire creators, they can browse profiles to find the best fit; 28 creators have already been offered full time positions.

We provide opportunities for artists to showcase their work, regardless of the Metaverse they specialize in. SandStorm currently has 1500 verified builders minting assets, creating profiles, and competing in themed builder competitions.


## Grant size

120,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x77BD4E9BB7094F92fb93b08cF5C368503CCd6c41

## Description

As we expand from the Sandbox into Decentraland, we will be holding builder competitions to engage DCL creators and are looking to secure a grant to distribute to the winners of these competitions. 100% of grant money will go to builder competition contestants.

SandStorm Current Ecosystem:

*   As a Sandbox Partner and one of the only playable public experiences in the Sandbox, our community is largely made up of voxel builders. We have employed the DCL Studio, Polygonal Mind, to construct our Social Hub in Decentraland. 100 DCL, 3D, and Blender artists have been onboarded to the platform already in preparation for our entry into Decentraland. The Sandstorm team has already received inquiries about independent 3D artists for hire.

*   We host a live show 5x times a week inside the Sandbox that are focused around builder tutorials, creator highlights, and live interviews with NFT projects and Legacy Brands that are creating experiences in the Metaverse. We will begin hosting live shows inside our Decentraland Social Hub once construction is complete in 3-6 months. POAPS are created and minted for each event.

*   We hold themed builder competitions once every two weeks with prizes of up to 5,000 SAND going to the winners (prize money funded by the Sandbox). The submissions and voting process are all broadcast live from our Twitch steam.

*   28 builders on our platform have been offered contract- and full-time roles to create experiences and assets that can be used on Metaverse LAND.

*   The Sandstorm team has employed another 10 independent artists to help us fulfill projects for our partners. Sandstorm currently has 10 partners that include: Slipknot, CyberKongz, Sappy Seals, Pudgy Penguins, and Alpacadrabraz.

*   Hosted the first live event inside the Sandbox and featured assets from 60+ creators on our platform.

How it benefits the DCL Creator Community:

*   Sandstorm provides a place for DCL creators to build their portfolio and get seen by brands that are looking for Metaverse creators.

*   Grant money will go entirely back to Decentraland creators as prizes for winning submissions in builder competitions.

*   As Sandstorm continues building experiences for its partners, we will be employing some of the most talented individual creators on our platform.

*   Sandstorm has onboarded 11 brands into the Sandbox with the intention of bringing them into the Decentraland ecosystem

*   Live shows will be hosted inside of our Decentraland Social Hub and provide additional opportunities for educational and entertaining content in and around the DCL environment.

Sorry in advance for confusion I just a guy that wants to buy more of everyones Decentraland wearables. Feel free to pitch revisions too since I open up for debate and just wanna get this red-tape bureaucracy  out of the way so we can let the market (aka me) buy what it wants to buy which is MORE of everyones epic Wearables!

If it were up to me all wearables would get auto approved no matter what and no fees to make it happen. However I guess there are some moving parts I do not understand so,
what about my hybrid idea? Allow anyone to mint warbles at anytime. Which will cost like $10+ mana gas fee per (approved wearables proposal) to @toonpunk23 team or whoever is doing the ""approving"" of Decentraland wearables. Plus the $100 to $200+ escrow mana like @DCLCurations was saying. That way it incentives faster approvals and feedback for non approvals to get approved.

We will call it the ""@DCLCurations - @AaronLeupp - @lastraum - @kevinonearth999 -@toonpunk23 - @Waifumons - @RealMattBond
(Let the market buy what they want even if it is Wallmart/Kirkland quality Act) ""

## Description

Opportunity

The Metaverse and GameFi spheres offer a rare opportunity for the gaming communities around the world to monetize their efforts and expertise, and MENA (Middle East & North Africa) is home to diverse and rich communities based around gaming, streaming and internet cultures.

Problem

MENA remains to be the globe's slowest region in terms of blockchain adoption, despite its young and online population making for a fertile adoption ground. This is due to slow regulatory adoption in some countries, poor adoption of online payment technology, and weak communication and localization infrastructure.

We aim to tackle the third issue.

Solution

We want to develop a high quality Arabic Youtube series, targeting Arab gaming communities, and educating them on three topics: 1) The Metavers / GameFi sector, 2) Decentraland, 3) Economic potential of the P2E model and other models to the residents of MENA.

The series will consist of 12 videos, ranging between 7 - 10 minutes.

The first six videos will focus on the Metaverse in general, starting with what is the Metaverse and how it works, then moving to the concept of Ecosystem and how different Metaverses have different rich ecosystems of gamers and builders. We will go through the big players in the Metaverse sphere so far, including the biggest Metaverse projects, biggest gaming companies entering the field, specially ones that are popular in MENA (e.g. Ubisoft), as well as celebrities and artists entering the field and developing their own virtual project.

We will then proceed to talk about the most prominent milestones that the industry has gone through so far, whether on the levels of adoption or development. We will explore collaborative and collective initiatives emerging in the sphere, such as guilds, alliances and aggregators, and lastly, we will offer an overview on the future of the Metaverse and potential of wider adoption.

In the second part of the series, which will consist of three videos, we will explore Decentraland as an entry point to gamers and builders alike to the Metaverse sphere. We will cover Decentraland's history, then explore in one video from a player's prospective, and in an other video from developer's prospective.

The last three videos will revolve around the economic potential of the Metaverse and GameFi for MENA residents. We will cover three main pillars of the Metaverse economy: Play-to-Earn models, virtual events and tours, and the virtual real estate market.

Goals

1- Raise awareness about the Metaverse and GameFi and their economic potential amongst MENA's gaming communities.
2- Introduce Decentraland as an entry point to the Metaverse / GameFi sphere to MENA users.
3- Provide a series that can serve as a reference point for Arabic videos that delve into the Metaverse with more details.


## Specification

We have already produced a sample video for the series. With the grant, we will be able to add a second camera and better lighting:

## Roadmap and milestones

If the grant request is approved, within 1 month we will have the temple on the purchased land, within 3 months we will have the P2E games implemented and the values to reward players will be enough for about 1 year.

Hopefully, over time, we will be able to profit from NFTs and keep the rewards without the need for DAO.

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

My aim is to build an in-depth tutorial series of videos to be hosted on the Decentraland youtube channel to cover the very basics, the regular
issues i see the community run into, and more advanced subjects like weighting from scratch, sculpting normals and painting textures through to submitting and minting items.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x862f109696d7121438642a78B3CaA38F476db08b

## Description

In my time as a wearable committee member i have noticed a lot of patterns that people make when making their wearables which result in it not showing
in the builder when importing, the mesh being squewed, etc. This tutorial series will be broken down into over 20 videos, each one covering a specific subject
so the user could easily locate the video that is relative to the help they need, making it a tool for trouble shooting which in turn will free up the committee
members time from not having to answer the same queries over and over in the discord channels. Also, the series will be a great resource for 3d artists to look over
before making the move into Decentraland so they can see all limits and best workflows when making wearables for Decentraland.
The videos will cover making all the different types of wearables and getting them in-game without any issues and abiding by the resource limits.

For each item (upperbody, helmet, lowerbody etc.) there will be a series of videos following it from mesh creation, UV unwrapping, normal sculpting and baking, texturing, rigging, testing and submission


## Specification

The tutorials will cover Blender, Photoshop and Substance Painter

The subjects that will be covered are;

\-\[setup]
\--downloading and importing the base mesh correctly

\-\[Modelling]

\--\[feet]
\---model shoes from scratch

\--\[lower body]
\---model lower body from scratch

\--\[upperbody]
\---model upperbody from the base mesh
\---model upperbody from scratch

\--head/helmet
\--accessories
\--skins

\-\[Texturing]
\--uvs

\--shader settings
\--emission & alpha

\-\[sculpting]
\--sculpting & baking normals
\--compiling normals and textures together

\-\[weighting]
\--auto weighting
\--manual weights
\---weighting hands that don't match armature
\---weighting skirts/dresses
\---weighting feet
\---weighting helmets/accessories

\-\[testing]
\--testing in the builder and in world and talking through common issues and how to solve them

2-4 videos will be made each week until the series is complete making the entire series complete within a 10 week period, Once all the production videos are made I will use some of the grant to publish the items so I can create the publishing and minting tutorials and the wearables will be given out to be used as giveaways at community events.

Once all the videos are complete and the models are published, all the files will be made public.

The current prices of LANDs are impossible for the majority of people who wants to join DCL metaverse. No free LANDs are available and the entry barriers are very high for those who wants to create content.

As it is a free market, I suggest to create more LANDS to reduce the prices in the market.

## Description

A year ago in the same week Football attempted to create the super league while famous Girondins de Bordeaux went almost bankrupt signalling the end of a model giving ways to either going dystopian or utopian. Time to act!
And so we did and are working on bringing the sport communities and the Web3 communities together.
Football (Every Sport in fact) and Web3 are communities - Our Fan Activation Network (FAN) platform brings the value back to the Clubs by granting Fans with governance, healthy games, a voice, unique NFTs and experiences money can't buy, IRL and in the metaverse.
Fan Activation Network is the first and only Web3 enabled platform that is valued around loyalty and not investment gambling such as the current so called Fan Engagement Coins companies. Over time, Sport Clubs will be owned by Private equity funds on the one hand and could, should and will be DAO by their constituencies on the other hand.

With our first Customer, French Federation of Rugby (best team in the world) we are building the Stade de France which hosts next year the World Cup , whereby the token holders will win access to crazy immersive moments with the players, parties, live interviews by the winner, joining them and singing in the cloak room altogether…
On top of the events we are working with the sensor developed by Decathlon (200G, no latency) to bring and enrich our earn to move games in the metaverse game studios.
That is part of our value proposition to the Olympics committee, where we are entering into the final stage of the selection process.
We’ll bring back the flame into the metaverse and you shall run with it too. Total madness !

With a pipeline that includes but not only the whole French professional football, the whole world rugby, the Olympics, ManU, our development on the Metaverse comes the cornerstone of bridging the Digital life and the good health.

The project also dares also to leverage the Metaverse to bring cultural events into the sport fan communities. That part of the project is in stealth mode for now and will require a separate conversation.

We are the first entering in that loyalty Web3 format as we believe that working with and for the clubs and federations under a profit sharing model is just and fair. And again, only Blockchain enabled us to put engagement, Gaming, NFTs, Metaverse together in a very compelling value proposition for the younger generations of fans , as the average age keeps increasing. We believe sport is a good thing , that clubs and federations have a role to play so then only bringing up the environment that generates the emotions along today’s vector will reactivate the enthusiasm IRL .
We shall declare success when the Fans / Followers communities will win empowerment from being viewers, singers, clappers, to being partial owner, member of the governance, and drive the movement of a better health, better shape, better life that only the merge of physical and socially Metaversed  (today digital) practice do bring to mankind.

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Final definitions for Linked Wearables](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f69c4d40-aaaf-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)

## Summary

A proposed implementation for the submission, approval, and in-world representation of third-party NFTs as wearables.


## Abstract

This project will onboard new communities to Decentraland, add new uses to other NFT projects, and be an experiment in NFT interoperability.

The following solution requires the original creators of an NFT project to apply to the DAO to be “registered” within Decentraland. Approved third parties will be able to upload the 3D assets needed to represent their NFTs as Wearables in Decentraland.

This is one more step of a long process, below theres is a list of the proposals involved:

1.  [Original proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)
2.  [Submission fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)
3.  [Programmatic collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83351b70-a0a0-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)
4.  [Final definitions for Linked Wearables](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f69c4d40-aaaf-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)


## Motivation

Web3 has given people more agency over their digital identities and the assets they own, but as more people purchase art from NFT projects, there is an increasing desire to bring these assets into other corners of the metaverse. In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when navigating through Decentraland.

The goal of this project is to **onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.


## Specification

**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland** that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.

Linked Wearables are not **[regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/)**. They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning. **They can not be bought or sold in Decentraland’s Marketplace.**

**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**

1.  **Create a DAO proposal** in the category **“Linked Wearables Registry”** to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available.
2.  Wait one week for DAO's approval and pass the 4M VP threshold.
3.  **Submit wearables** in the **Builder** using the available Slots.
4.  Develop the API following [this specification](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).
5.  Wait for Curators Committee approval.
6.  Spread the word! Tell your community that they can **enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.

**Application Process**

Third parties will create a DAO proposal in the category “Linked Wearables Registry” to be accepted in the registry. The vote will last for a week and will require a minimum threshold of participation of 4M VP.

The inclusion of the third party into the Registry will be done by the DAO Committee. This process will create slots for the third party and enable access to the publication flow.

**Slots**

A Slot is a potential representation of an NFT as a Decentraland Wearable. They define the maximum amount of different wearables designs the Third Party can use.

Depending on the strategy the collection owners choose, they can request 1 slot (i.e. All holders of the NFT collection will get the same Linked Wearable) or multiple slots (i.e. If the collection has 7,777 NFTs they can request for 7,777 slots to match the wearable with the NFTs look & feel)

Slots are free and requested by third parties on their application. They can later request more slots if necessary.

**Wearable Submission**

The Third Party will be able to use the Builder tool to submit a wearable design for each Slot. The wearable model must follow the same specs as any regular wearables and will be subject to the curation process of the Wearable Curation Committee.

**API Development**

Once the wearables are submitted to review the third party must create an API that resolves the assignment between NFT owners and Decentraland Wearables.

This is a scalable and cross-chain solution to accommodate different scenarios. The API might assign the same wearable for every NFT holder; or different wearables for different groups of NFT holders; or even more, a unique design for each NFT holder.

**Curation Process**

The Wearable Curation Committee will curate the submitted wearables as part of their regular flow. The curation fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn’t matter what type of collection it is.

For Programmatic Collections with more the 50 items, the curation won’t review each design one by one, instead, a new curation process will be executed following these general guidelines:

1.  Audit the wearable generation process.
2.  Define a curation plan based on the process.
3.  Curate 1% of the collection (min 50, max 300).


## Impacts

Linked Wearables will enable NFT Communities to customize their avatar in Decentraland. This is beneficial for both parties because the **NFTs get a new use case** (adding value to the collection and the community) and also, new users will be exposed to Decentraland’s experience.

This proposal will create a new flow of publication of wearables that might compete with the current publication process. This issue is mitigated by several factors:

1.  **Third Parties need to be approved by the DAO** in order to use this publication flow.
2.  The NFTs associated with **these wearables can’t be traded in Decentraland’s marketplace.**
3.  Third-party need their own NFT smart contract and build/maintain a public API for the integration to work.

The DAO will not receive submission fees for this process but still cover the compensation of the Wearable Curator Committee, thus increase DAO’s expenses. However, with the current situation of the DAO treasury this shouldn’t be a limitation, and instead see it as a marketing investment.

The Linked Wearables project will also incentivize the wearable creation economy, generating more jobs for 3d designers and studios with experience in Decentraland. The NFT communities won’t pay the DAO a submission fee but will invest resources in those with knowledge in the craft of wearable making.

Expected upsides:

*   Onboard many NFT communities to Decentraland.
*   Become a case study about interoperability between NFT projects.

Undesirable (but possible) outcomes:

*   Communities might not gather enough VP to be listed in the Linked Wearables Registry.
*   Implementation and maintenance of integration might be costly for members of the Linked Wearables Registry.


## Implementation Pathways

The implementation of this feature involves the following applications:

*   Governance dApp.
    *   Enable the external NFT communities to propose themselves for the registry.

*   Linked Wearables Registry - A new dApp to manage the registry.
    *   DAO Committee Members can add new members to the registry.
    *   DAO Committee Members can manage available slots for registry members.
    *   Registry members can update their managers and resolver API.

*   Builder Tool
    *   Managers of the communities listed on the Linked Wearable Registry will be able to create collections using their available slots and submit them to review.
    *   Wearable Curation Committee will review the collections and upload the content to the catalysts network upon approval.

*   Third-party API
    *   This is an external API maintained by the third parties in Linked Wearables Registry.
    *   It enables the mapping between NFT owners and submitted wearables.

*   World Explorer:
    *   Wearables linked to external NFTs will be displayed in the explorer's backpack.


## Conclusion

This should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer. We, as a community, also need to welcome them and make it easy to access but at the same time, secure. Please vote 😄.

The reason for this proposal is to streamline the gameplay of users.

I come to propose 2 points that I consider essential:

Allow to sort wearables in the overview by received date and by rarity, be able to customize.

Allow customization of the avatar, so that a set of clothes is saved. An example: 2 customizations (one for party outfits and one for Wonderzone).

This would free the user a lot from choosing clothes for the bonuses, or searching through so many wearables.

## Description

The former 'Cliff House' now more officially, Lands End Properties (LEP), are for up for lease proposal.  The Pacific Cliffs Foundation (PCF) is a community run DAO aimed at winning the bid to lease the Lands End properties.  We are seeking a grant from the Decentraland DAO of $60,000 in order to secure our proposal and set the pieces in motion to make not only our campaign, but the eventual operation a success.

We have a proposal in place and have lofty plans concocted by local hospitality industry veterans, design professionals, world class construction firms, artists and local families to transform these epic properties into flourishing establishments for locals and tourists.  However, we need to garner the attention of the public in order to generate momentum.  Securing a Decentraland DAO grant will catapult our capabilities  to let us build out or vision and raise a public eyebrow to show that we are serious!

Here's how it works.  The LEP properties will essentially be linked with Decentraland as a major on boarding hub ""in real life"" for Web3 and Decentraland.  Integrating Web3 technology and Decentraland to a tangible space in the real world creates an amazing opprotunity to show what is possible IRL and in the Metaverse.  More specifically, the event space on site will be a Decentraland Metaverse space to bring the Lands End properties and events to everyone around the world, and vice versa.

Host an event on site at the LEP or in Decentraland and it will mirror that event.  For example if I am hosting an educational seminar about how NFTs can revolutionize the publishing industry in the actual event space, it will be broadcast to the corresponding location in Decentraland.


## Specification

Upon receipt of the grant $Mana we will begin a course of action to accelerate our campaign.

1.  Create a ferocious marketing campaign announcing our partnership with Decentraland that highlights key aspects of the project like showcasing the power of a DAO, having a tangible and beautiful space that embraces the past and sees the future, while creating the link between real world and onboarding people to experience Decentraland.
2.  Showcase the beauty of the property and potential the DAO can have while showcasing the link to Decentraland and how it can be beneficial to the people.
3.  Buy a land in Decentraland.
4.  Establish an office in SF where we can hire engineers, creatives and anyone needed to outline and develop our land to be modeled after the original Cliff House, establish our DAO and outline a plan for what to do once we obtain the lease.
5.  Create an NFT project using local artist and engineers where minting sales and secondary sales all go to the DAO treasury.  NFT project will be hosted and minted through the Land we develop in Decentraland.
6.  Further development of Decentraland Metaverse Cliff House including adding as a point of interest, establishing meeting spaces, giving virtual tours that can link to real time cameras,  and creating NFTs of any historical photographs or relics and other fun ideas to generate a buzz, raise money and awareness.


## Personnel

My name is Trent Simpson and currently, this a project that I have been working on solo, but that is exactly why I am writing this grant!  The grant money will infuse this project with the ability to hire talented people to build the Cliff House in Decentraland while giving us that validity to move forward with the actual space.

I have an extensive background in hospitality and luxury goods sales and marketing on a global scale.  I have seen thousands of incredible restaurants and event spaces around the world, and I truly believe the LEP is one of the most beautiful establishments.  I have set out on a quest to launch a campaign #SavetheCliffHouse via a DAO and showcase the power of community and prove that tangible applications of a DAO can be successful! I was the treasurer for the SF chapter of the United States Bartenders' Guild and am a very passionate student of Web3, NFTs, brand marketing and a good martini overlooking the ocean.

I have started a Twitter and a Medium for the Pacific Cliffs Foundation DAO campaign to #SavetheCliffHouse

As some of the wearables in decentraland have utility in games.
What I want to achieve is to show extended metadata for wearables in Decentraland marketplace and Opensea.
Visual example: https://bafybeierdoahginhssrnhykue3rdjzvdhcq723in6aj7zb7iemyckf6rq4.ipfs.nftstorage.link/

Ideally, would be that publisher sets an endpoint to provide the extended metadata to allow mutability.

But before defining the technical approach lets see if people likes it.

say you're in the virtual world of Decentraland and you run across someone that has their top 5 or 3 main interest listed next to their name and can be changed periodically.. something so simple as "" Someone to talk to "" promoting mental health, or ""First person shooter"" .. allows us to interact with someone easier.. "" what first person shooters you play?"".. ""you need someone to talk to? whats going on?"" ... if there is an event you're attending that day, show it off in your avatar and see if theres anyone else attending the same event. So many ways to interact in an easier way.. I truly believe this idea has major upside and potential. From brands to really anything at all. endless probabilities.

15516,15516,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,DAO Governance Proposal Stages,"> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)

**Summary**

Establish a robust and binding voting process for governance proposals.

**Abstract**

To reduce the impact of spam and low quality proposals and increase time to assess implications and implementation pathways - each “Governance Proposal” should pass through three distinct stages. Proposals must meet specific criteria before they may be moved to the next stage. The end result is a binding governance decision.

**Motivation**

Community “Polls” are the only mechanism at this time for the community to vote on complicated governance issues, for example, on issues surrounding voting power, fee structures, and other socio-economic dynamics. The poll category is designed to be a non-binding gauge of community perceptions, not a binding governance proposal. However, in response to community feedback, the DAO Committee has taken on the practice of implementing polls as policy, in the absence of a more formal voting mechanism.

This is problematic for three reasons. First, the poll format does not allow time for consensus building and adequate assessment of impacts and implementation pathways. Second, there are no restrictions on who can submit a community poll, leading to spam proposals and there are no voting power thresholds to ensure important governance decisions are made by a representative majority (based on voting power). Finally, because polls are non-binding, their implementation has become dependent on the DAO committee, undermining the efficacy of the DAO and confidence in our governance process.

This proposal aims to establish a three-tiered voting process that begins with a “community poll” in its current form, and ends in a binding “governance proposal.”

\*\*Specification \*\*

The voting process will include three tiers: Pre-Proposal Poll, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal. Each tier will have progressively increasing submission and passage thresholds.

***Stage 1: Pre-Proposal Poll***

The purpose of the Pre-Proposal Poll is to introduce a governance issue to the community, gauge community sentiment, and determine if there is enough support to move forward with the drafting of an initial proposal. Pre-Proposal Polls can only pass to the Draft Proposal stage if they have accumulated a threshold of at least 500K VP. A poll that reaches at least 500K VP and does *not* garner a majority of participating voting power, may *still* advance to the Draft Proposal stage - ensuring all issues with enough support have an initial pathway toward passage into policy.

Polls do not need to be composed in any specific form. They can be drafted in the full proposal format, or be presented as a straightforward question. Polls are currently the only option we have for governance issues that fall outside the established categories (Grants, name ban, catalysts and POIs).

*   Submission Threshold: 100 VP (i.e. equivalent to one name)
*   Passage Threshold: 500K VP
*   Voting Period: 5 Days

***Stage 2: Draft Proposal***

The purpose of the Draft Proposal is to present a potential policy to the community in a structured format and to formalize discussion about a proposal's potential impacts and implementation pathways. Draft Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 1), and can only pass to the binding Governance Proposal stage with a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power with a threshold of at least 1M VP. A Draft Proposal that fails or does not reach this threshold can be amended and resubmitted one time.

*   Submission Threshold: 1,000 VP (or delegated VP)
*   Passage Threshold: 1M VP
*   Voting Period: 1 Week

***Stage 3: Binding Governance Proposal***

The purpose of the Governance Proposal is to formalize the passed version of a Draft Proposal  into a binding governance outcome. Only established or recognized community members can submit Governance Proposals, which are only passed if they reach the needed acceptance criteria for their category. In the interim period before new voting categories have been established (and for proposals that do not have a pre-set category) a Governance Proposal must receive a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power and at least 6M VP to pass as a binding decision.

Processes and thresholds for established categories will not be changed as part of this proposal. Meaning, the process for grants, POIs, etc… will remain unchanged. Additional categories for specific types of issues, e,g, “fee structures,” will be proposed, and relevant processes and thresholds developed.

Governance Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 2).

*   Submission Threshold: 2,500 VP (or delegated VP)
*   Passage Threshold: 6M VP (or needed acceptance criteria for their category)
*   Voting Period: 2 Weeks

**Conclusion**

DAO Governance should be agile and responsive, however, at the same time tempered and deliberative. In its current form, important community decisions are being made on a week-to-week basis, and through non-binding community polls. The proposed voting framework will moderate the pace of our self-government and facilitate a detailed and deliberative process to ensure we make informed and representative decisions.

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

We have a Twitter page where we make daily videos about upcoming events in Decentraland. The main purpose of this page is to make easier for the everyday user to know more about the current events of the day, with informative short videos about the events details and artist's background (if any performing). Think of it as the live events list, but with subtitled videos explaining them.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xBD03aDd5da0e173C67C9C1073FFBA017147c42d4

## Description

One thing we noticed is that somedays it can get hard to keep track of events! Our goal is to make the event page more digestable for the average user, by visually explaining the activities of the day.

Currently we're doing at least 3x subtitled videos per day, the next step is doubling that. Our goal is to bring more awareness to the whole community overall.


## Specification

If the grant is approved, we will expand further the team to keep covering the entire events page every single day. We still aim to create translated videos to the Brazilian audience and expand to tiktok.  We will also invest in paid ads for both pages monthly.

Twitter page: https://twitter.com/DclHighlights


## Personnel

My name is Vapo and I create videos by myself. I've been working fulltime in metaverse-related content since december 2021, contributing with videos and advertisement in different projects.

My objective is to become a steady source of video news about Decentraland events. I want to continue creating relevant content everyday in multiple platforms to bring new users and keep current players updated as much as possible!


## Roadmap and milestones

15519,15519,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Would you support a proposal to allow fractional MANA sales in the secondary market?,"> by 0x6a77883ed4e65a1df591fda2f5252fd7c548f198 (Fancy)

The option to price your wearables for fractional MANA does not currently exist on the Marketplace UI, however the smart contract already allows for it.  Would you be in support of updating the Marketplace UI to allow for fractional MANA pricing?

Rational

\*There are over 150 items in the primary market which are listed below 1 MANA.  This eliminates a reasonable resale market.

\*The small group that already appears to be pricing for fractional mana are mostly item farming accounts/bots.

\*By opening up the secondary market to lower valued items, it will increase the interest and accessibility to the market.  New users could save for higher valued or more desirable items without having to spend fiat to participate.  Many people cannot afford to purchase MANA, but almost everyone has items they have been given through events or content creator giveaways.

\*This could potentially SAVE the DAO in matic gas fees by reducing the number of junk listings which never sell, and get relisted by the thousands on a daily basis.  By establishing an actual value, less valuable items may find their way to the end consumer or long term investor faster.

I previously submitted a similar proposal, but didn't take it seriously or put much effort into it.  You can read that here: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=40bb3970-93dd-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a

If this poll passes the approval threshold, I will open a forum post to discuss concerns and any other type of feedback to make sure this is something everyone approves of.   Thanks for your time!

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

This grant seeks to award NFTs to individuals who engage with the world outside the plazas and gaming areas. It encourages them to explore our houses, NFTs, billboards, ads, games, etc. with NFT awards for doing so.


## Grant size

2,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

## Description

I’ve explored the areas outside the plazas extensively, enjoying the unique world that Decentraland has to offer: Games, quests, and houses that would be unimaginable in the material world. In all those explorations, do you know how many people I’ve see outside the plazas (besides at the JP Morgan Chase house)? Three, and they were in one group.

Many of us have properties, billboards, ads, and NFTs that lie dormant in the outside world. What’s the point of having these properties if no one is going to visit them?
In Decentraland, there is only one place outside a casino that gets much traffic: Wondermine Meteor Mining. Why does it get traffic? Because people can earn NFTs.

To get people to engage with our properties, NFTs, ads, billboards, etc., we need to encourage them to engage with the world outside the plazas and gaming areas. To do that, I propose that we provide NFT awards for earning badges for engaging with the larger world.

Some possibilities:

Traveler’s Boots that award a 10% speed increase. These can be earned by exploring 20 miles of Decentraland.

Curiosity Cap – Awarded for opening 150+ UIs to outside websites. Provides 5% discount on Marketplace purchases.

Adventurer’s Sword – Awarded for completing Graveyard Quest, Quest of the Alcoholic Scarecrow, etc. This sword can be used to gain access to a separate questing zone with NPCs to fight and where they can earn money to use to buy more NFTs.

Gamer’s Gloves - Awarded to people who achieve high scores at all selected games, including The Adventures of Koko Jones, the Dragon Rush, etc. These can provide a 5% mining bonus for Wondermine.

A list of badges can be found in each user’s dashboard, as well as a checklist for each that shows what they need to do to earn the badge and the associated NFT.

Each badge category can have multiple levels, for instance different boots for exploring 20 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles, all with different bonuses.


## Specification

The framework for these goals already exist within Decentraland. The games are already there, the land, houses, and NFTs already exist, and the only necessary funding is for the creation of the award NFTs. Additional participation from the Decentraland Foundation will be necessary to make this a reality.


## Personnel

As yet to be determined team of 5 volunteers to come up with badge requirements and associated NFTs.

NFT creator to make the NFTs. $2000 USD

Decentraland Foundation assistance to implement the badges.


## Roadmap and milestones

Assemble a team of 5 volunteers to help develop these goals - 2 weeks

Team develops framework for the badge system (badge requirements and NFT awards) - 2 weeks

Creation of NFTs - 2 weeks

Implementation of Badge system by Decentraland Foundation - Uncertain

15521,15521,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should We Utilise Genesis Resources,"> by 0x336685bb3a96e13b77e909d7c52e8afcff1e859e (michitodd)

SUMMARY
 This governance pre-proposal is to set up a booking system for the Genesis Plaza Auditorium for a pre-recorded video queue at the cost of 20mana per booking.

ABSTRACT

Currently there are spaces and resources that Decentraland have set up that can’t really be used. Allowing a way to book the auditorium is one way we can boost engagement, allow access to the metaverse for different types of industries and also support local twitch streamers.

Price has been placed to avoid the service being abused but also not so high it’s unobtainable to some users from a global perspective. This is a high traffic location and the more traffic, the higher mana value will become and this will justify a higher price for this streaming location.

This will allow users without access to land to hold small events, workshops and shows that’s easily accessible and being local to genesis plaza something to find straight away for new users to engage with. This will also allow Decentraland committee members or foundation to host talks or discuss updates that are separate from townhall.

The system will work as a kind of Juke-Box so it can be completely automattic without the need of a committee or central management. Users can supply a youtube or vimeo link when booking and the video will be added to the queuing system. When no video is laying it will revert back to the default looping video currently playing.

I’m happy to support where I can as a member of the community to have this implemented so momentum isn’t lost!

MOTIVATION
 Decentraland currently has community resources that can be utilized to support the new users or creators without access to land. With the recent increase of land rental it would allow an easy way to run community events and simple revenue stream of mana into the DAO to fund future grants/proposals.

Allowing a booking system to the auditorium will benefit:

*   Film Makers
*   Streamers
*   Podcasts
*   Musicians/DJs
*   Educators
*   Animators

In the past we’ve seen successful events around movie showings , sports steaming and a need for that shared viewing experience.

IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS

Queued video service set up on the Governance forum with a fee to submit
NPC deployed (I can design or we can use existing robot NPCs) in the Auditorium that can have basic explanation of bookings and link to the governance forum
Vimeo or Youtube link supplied to avoid any harmful or IP infringement content
Contact details supplied and IP ownership signed by users when booking, so if something like unlicensed music or footage is played the ownership is on the user, and not Decentraland

CONCLUSION

This can be a test and learn to explore ways to develop new areas of revenue as part of the Decentraland platform, methods to utilise existing resources (Gamer Plaza, Las Vegas etc) and setting up a space to share with the community. This is also experimenting how much the community can influence the user experience in Decentraland community spaces that get overlooked.

A booking system can potentially expand to other community resources owned by Decentraland or foundation. This will reduce barriers to entry for a wide variety of industries and events like short film festivals, comedy shows, live performances, business presentations etc.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

Create an interactive immersive VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction within Decentraland.


## Grant size

160,000 USD

## Description

I, Kirk Gonzales, the CEO of Animation Studio Lightspeed Graphics, LLC (lightspeedgfx.com) is requesting a grant of $160,000 to build a Metaverse Ride Simulator Attraction experience within Decentraland.

Lightspeed Graphics is an Animation studio from California producing 2D Motion Graphics, 3D Animation, AR/VR, Game Design and Visual Effects. Lightspeed Graphics was launched in 2017 to create multimedia digital video experiences, commercial advertising, and graphic design, and would like to be the first to develop a new and exciting animated attraction within Decentraland.

The Lightspeed Graphics team believes in the need to bring Virtual Reality and storytelling as a truly rewarding and engaging experience to face challenges like user adoption, market size capture, and player satisfaction or retention among many other determinants. The VR industry will become more prevalent and interconnected to metaverse web3 applications as we reach mass adoption in the coming years and as new projects make their own unique metaverse-like experience.

The idea was inspired by the classic Ride Simulator Attractions seen at amusement parks, exhibits or tech museums that have been enjoyed for generations. We believe bringing this ride simulator experience into the metaverse will help bring value to Decentraland and help transition real world attractions or experiences into a connected metaverse experience.

Veteran players and new players from AR/VR users, gamers, developers, film industry specialists, MX specialists and quite possibly well-known companies like Dynamic Attractions are all part of the target audience as we carve a space for VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attractions.

The Lightspeed Graphics Team and any additional contractors will work closely together to develop a first of its kind Metaverse VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction with a complete narrative storyline, interactivity and future multiplayer experience.


## Specification

The VR/Desktop Ride simulator will be accessible to the public and be distinguishable by the ‘Jump 2 Lightspeed’ logo. The size will need to be at least a 3x3 estate. The first adventure will be completely free to the public to ride indefinitely and be a learning experience for returning and new users to Decentraland. A crafting system will guide players to create unique wearables, in-game items and trade systems. Later, story add-ons called ‘Arcs’ will be gated by an initial purchase of an NFT, tickets, or subscription.

Once the Player has been granted access and has clicked the Ride Simulator, they are transported to a fixed chair position with the user’s perspective locked to the view of their avatar, while other avatars can be seen filling empty chair slots, (multiplayer experience), as the ride makes its final countdown to launch. Sponsored videos (will play during the countdown process to and promote other adventures, events, and activities throughout DCL.

Once the countdown has completed, no other players can join that adventure instance at this point. The lights dim and the animated adventure on screen begins playing.
The user has the option to enter fullscreen and see the entire video experience with a full monitor takeover, while the Oculus Headset user is now able to do a full headset takeover.
The game itself will feel like a rollercoaster ride through space, complete with narrative, voice over performances. Future development will bring the ability to fire and aim at targets with the mouse or Oculus controllers, making it a complete interactive game.

## NFT Collections Description

Woodies is a decentralized web3 entertainment brand with a collection of 9,739 NFTs. It was released in September 2021 as a collaboration from UltraDAO artists. Offering a mixed model of de/centralized IP ownership, it conveys family-friendly, story-driven artwork and themes supporting nature and conservation. Woodies has also funded a ‘One Million Tree’ campaign with non-profit organization Trees for the Future. Woodies has nurtured a warm and inclusive culture, and is also hosting live outings in real life – hiking, rafting, etc. Congregating in Decentraland offers a way to involve a global
community that cannot attend every event, and a way to sustain and deepen the connections our members are already making with one another.

## Motivation

Our goal for Woodies in Decentraland is to create immersive and evolving experiences that bring the community together through storytelling, shared interests and goals. The artwork, including the 900+ original traits, has been transformed into the fun aesthetic style of Decentraland and is ready for use as ‘linked wearables’. How cool is it going to be to turn your avatar into a tree-like Woodie and see your 2D Woodie come to life!? We will create a home for Woodies where we can gather for our weekly community meetings, create exhibitions, invite guest speakers such as our partner charities and more. Ultimately Woodies is eager to push the boundaries of what is possible and explore new frontiers for art and engagement in Decentraland.

We created a master file with all traits (hair, nose, mouth, eyes, accessories, clothing, etc), named the 3D objects to match the original collection's 2D attributes, then run a batch script that creates individual 3D skin files with the correct traits based on the 2D counterpart.

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Improved backpack features](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cc31d6b0-01da-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f)

## Summary

Improved backpack-features


## Abstract

The reason for this proposal is to streamline the gameplay of users.

I come to propose 2 points that I consider essential:

Allow to sort wearables in the overview by received date and by rarity, be able to customize.

Allow customization of the avatar, so that a set of clothes is saved. An example: 2 customizations (one for party outfits and one for Wonderzone).

This would free the user a lot from choosing clothes for the bonuses, or searching through so many wearables.


## Motivation

It is extremely necessary, since searching through all the wearables is somewhat uncomfortable.

It would make the game much easier.


## Specification

The reason for this proposal is to streamline the gameplay of users.

I come to propose 2 points that I consider essential:

Allow to sort wearables in the overview by received date and by rarity, be able to customize.

Allow customization of the avatar, so that a set of clothes is saved. An example: 2 customizations (one for party outfits and one for Wonderzone).

This would free the user a lot from choosing clothes for the bonuses, or searching through so many wearables.


## Impacts

I do not think that this proposal will have any negative impact.


## Implementation Pathways

Step 1: Develop a search for the backpack by name, rarity, or arrival date of the wearable.

Step 2: Create custom groups of clothing outfits to change avatar customization (parties, different p2e or any other desired outfit).


## Conclusion

The conclusion of all this is to be able to order by type of wearable (epic, rare, legendary...) order by date of entry of the wearable, order by ""listed for sale"" or ""not listed"" and to be able to create clothing outfits for directly change the entire avatar with one click.

Complete clothing customizations

## Description

To prevent spread of violence in the lands, the name reminds subjects of the terrorist groups exploiting religious discourse and divisions to advance their totalitarian ideology, or by governments.

15528,15528,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Royalty-free audio clip library for land builders in Decentraland,"> by 0x09bc69a986e1b37fb01ef36124f4c2e14fa0ab6b (BillyTeacoin)

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

I would like to see more music and sound content in Decentraland to help create a more immersive environment for us all in Decentraland. Most of the community who are building in the space are 3D design artists and coders, not sound artists. Much like how there are free 3D assets for the DCL builder to drag and drop into a build, I believe that a mini library of stock music and sounds should also be open to all in Decentraland to use. I wish to create this for everyone in DCL to use in their builds.


## Grant size

4,569 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x09bc69A986e1b37fB01EF36124f4c2E14fA0ab6B

## Email address

billyteacoin@gmail.com

## Description

I have noticed when loading into many parcels in Decentraland that it is quite often lacking sound.
I think without sound a lot of Decentraland is lacking that immersive experience that a complete audiovisual package can give you. If you think about watching a video, sound is 50% of the experience (in my opinion it can be even up to 69% of the experience)! The same I think can be said for games and in interactive virtual world experiences (like Decentraland).

I propose to create a series of sound clips that anyone building in Decentraland can use for absolutely free on their parcel (with a copyright notice/license agreement stating that these sound clips may only be used within Decentraland).

Many games within Decentraland could freely use these music compositions or ambience tracks to help with that sonic void in their build. For example, games such as: Wondermine, Exodus, Butterfly Prawn, Golfcraft and more if they don’t yet have any music.
Some of the plazas seem to be lacking sound including: Forest Plaza, Vegas Plaza and Medieval Plaza. These places feel rather dead to me when entering as there is nothing much to be heard.

The music as you enter Decentraland in Genesis Plaza is a great example of a parcel that effectively includes sound/music.
Some other plazas like Soho Plaza, Asian Plaza and Gamer Plaza include background soundscapes which help immerse the player in the build.


## Specification

Scope of delivery:
6 to 9 field recordings for natural ambient tracks (captured on pro location audio recording equipment)
6 to 9 music compositions of various styles (composed on a Digital Audio Workstation)
6 to 9 electronic/synth ambient tracks (sound designed on a Digital Audio Workstation)
A small collection of sound effects/foley for basic object interactions (doors opening and chests opening etc)
The plan will be to host these audio clips on a basic website/hosting service which I will set up myself with help from other community members who have offered me assistance.
One idea might be to create an “npm package”, have the audio files selectable by the owner/operator who can then stream the audio files to their build with just using some code in the SDK.
I will likely host the audio clips as ogg vorbis as this is a great codec for high quality in a small file size format. However I will consult builders in the community to help me decide on optimization of the files for playback in Decentraland builds so things work smoothly.

These will all be freely available for anyone to use in Decentraland. If anyone wants something unique to their own build then they can hire me (or someone else) of their own accord to create something for them. But this Decentraland public mini library of audio clips will give anyone something to start off with and help give Decentraland some more sound to immerse ourselves in-world.

Breakdown of expected costs in Australian Dollars (AUD):
Sound libraries to create a vast array of professional sounding music scores:
Choral sounds $300
Symphony orchestra sounds $540
Large library bundle of soft synths and sounds $1800
Action/blockbuster film strings library $450

Salary of 69 hours x $43 hourly rate (work spread over 2 to 3 months) = $2,967
Salary given is based on Average Base Salary for a Music Composer in Australia and estimated roughly 2 weeks of work if worked on full time. Source: https://www.salaryexpert.com/salary/job/music-composer/australia

File hosting: approx $600 to host files/website for at least 3 years

Total expected cost: $6,657 AUD = $4,569 USD

Equipment already provided by myself, therefore not required by the grant:
Digital Audio Workstation (including computer and DAW software)
Microphones and professional location recording equipment
Musical keyboard, mixers, studio monitor speakers and headphones etc.

At the completion of the core part of the project I will continue to maintain the free audio clip library for DCL and at my own discretion voluntarily add to it in my own time if I am able.
I do not directly intend to create another grant proposal for this project specifically into the future and I wish to seek outside funding or community donations (or out of my own pocket if necessary) to keep the files hosted after the grant funds have run out for approx 3 years of hosting.
If there is any significant demand from the Decentraland community however, there may be a consideration to hire me and/or other sound artists in the community (via another grant) to significantly expand upon this free audio clip library, as the community sees fit.

Apart from that, I am quite an active member in the Decentraland community and wish to improve the enjoyment of experiences within Decentraland for existing members and new. That’s why I’d like to bring my skills in sound to enhance the content in the space.


## Roadmap and milestones

Month 1 – gather as many field recordings as possible to create a collection of natural ambience soundscapes (nature sounds, city sounds, café background sounds etc). Initially I will make these publicly available on a Google Drive account so I can show others in the community previews of the work for me to receive feedback.

With the funding, all required sound library packs needed to compose the music etc will be purchased.

A web hosting service for storing the audio clips will start to be set up and paid for.

Month 2 – composing the collection of music scores. Upload these to Google Drive for feedback from the community.

Trial testing of audio clips as npm packages and testing in DCL builds using SDK.

Month 3 – compose/sound design electronic ambience tracks (for sci-fi and general non-natural ambience). Record and prepare a small collection of sound effects and foley sounds.
Upload the remaining work to Google Drive and approach builders in the community to make them aware of these free sounds and music scores and ask them to test them and give feedback.

I will update and consult the community on progress as I go via Discord, most predominantly the Community Building Decentraland Discord server.
I will also post major announcements/updates to social media, mainly Twitter as this is where most of the Decentraland/Web3 community resides social media wise.

### Description

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The Candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, Kristian ([DappCraft](https://dappcraft.io/)), 3D Artist and wearable creator from Dappcraft, was nominated:

<https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=item&section=wearables&isMap=false&isFullscreen=false&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=recently_listed&onlyOnSale=true&search=dappcraft&viewAsGuest=false&onlySmart=false>

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.  This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

15535,15535,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,A proposal for minimum VP participation thresholds required to pass DAO proposals,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Overview**

As participation in the DAO increases and more proposals are submitted, there is an increased risk of approving malicious, spammy, or poorly-formulated proposals. To protect the DAO from such proposals being passed unknowingly, a minimum amount of participating VP should be required to vote in favor of a proposal in order for it to be passed and enacted.

This risk is especially relevant to community grants funded by the DAO. With the recent approval of [this grants framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49), users will soon be able to request MANA to fund projects by means of one-time payments and vesting contracts.

The lack of a minimum VP needed to pass a vote combined with an increase in proposal submissions may result in many underqualified or fraudulent grants receiving approval. While the DAO Committee is responsible for initiating the transfer of funds for grants, the final approval for grants should come from a majority vote within the community, not the DAO Committee.

**Specification**

The minimum VP participation required to approve a proposal may vary depending on the proposal category. Given the financial risk associated with community grants, the minimum should be higher for these proposals.

*   A minimum of **1 million VP** should be required to vote **YES** on a grant request for it to be approved, if the YES votes have the majority
*   A minimum of **500k VP** should be required to vote **YES** on POI additions, Name Bans, and Catalyst node additions for these actions to be enacted by the DAO, if the YES votes have the majority

These thresholds should be subject to change in future, as seen fit by the DAO.

As can be seen in recently approved POI additions this level of support is not difficult to reach, but still plays an important role in preventing unnoticed proposals from ""slipping through"" the DAO.

**Benefits**

*   Helps to ensure that enacted proposals more accurately reflect the sentiment of the greater community
*   Helps to prevent the DAO from funding underqualified, poorly-formulated, or fraudulent grants
*   Helps to ensure that high quality POIs are added
*   Helps to prevent the addition of low-quality Catalyst nodes to Decentraland's network that might negatively impact users' experience
*   Prevents abuse of the Banned Name list

**For**

Implement the described minimum VP participation needed to approve proposals.

**Against**

Continue allowing proposals to pass without a minimum VP participation.

- For
- Against

15536,15536,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Open source DCL utility library that makes many things easier,"> by 0xc1b8662a68f3eb66bc5e5c4de7c1ef04dc344d53 (Patmacs)

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

I've been building in DCL for half a year now and I have been very active in the community discord. I'm constantly helping everyone that I can, as we all figure out how to be better developers together. I have over 20 years of coding experience, including 6 years in blockchain specific development. I'm proficient in APIs, DBs, servers, solidity, server architecture, blender, photoshop, react, js, ts, ect.

I'm a strong advocate for sharing not only what I've learned, but also the tools that I've built to make my own development easier. I want to share it all.

As of yesterday, I've released an early build of the tools for the community - https://github.com/pmacom/dclconnect


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53

## Description

You'll be able to easily:

*   Place good looking (and performant) highlight boxes
*   Add holdable/intractable items that will make GAME making so much easier
*   Animate UIImage and UIText with ease. fadeTo, moveTo, scaleTo, ect.
*   Inventory system for displaying details about your holdable items
*   Storage system for placing entities into containers easily
*   Debug tools for placing items in the game, instead of saving and refreshing often
*   Audio/Video sound GUI for your parcel users to adjust volumes for individual audio sources.
*   Experience bars that animate when the value is updated
*   Much much more.

Requests for common problems can be added to the github issue queue for my repo. I'm slowly adding in all of the things I've built. This obviously takes a large amount of time, and I'm doing it for free. Please consider this proposal. What I have already provided should benefit the community already, with some extra mana funds I'll be able to purchase some more land for testing out more interesting experiments which will also be rolled back into the community library I've created.

Please visit farm (DecentraFarm) to see many of these elements working together (It's still a work in progress obviously)
https://play.decentraland.org/?position=0%2C-1\&realm=unicorn-blue

Also visit my comedy/bar venue (TheBlock) - (Also a work in progress)
https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-18%2C-122\&realm=unicorn-blue


## Specification

I'm going to set up a semantic version control for the project very soon. Other contributors can submit pull requests to help strengthen the util library as a whole. I will maintain and update it regularly with whatever I build.

Visit https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeV8zMwwclJX7Bf-JdxdJxw
to see whats coming. Tutorial videos will be included for each component, as well as detailed documentation about implementation.


## Personnel

Patmacs - I'm very active (maybe even annoyingly so) in the #SDK discord channel. I have over 20 years experience in web development, 18 years professionally. JS/TS, APIs, React, Blender, Photoshop, Solidity, ect. I've done it all probably. Hit me up in discord to test my knowledge/experience on a specific topic.


## Roadmap and milestones

Over the next few weeks I'll be moving a lot of the code from DecentraFarm into TheBlock in anticipation of a formal grand opening.  This will be done by first adding each feature to the dclconnect npm library,  documenting the process, recording videos, and implementing them into the venue. This process drastically extends the release of my own venue. However, I believe it's worth the effort, if the community can find these tools useful.

The feature list is included in the Description.

A second phase may include another batch of components/entities that are specifically requested by the community. It may require an additional grant to develop. I'm not quite sure yet.

15538,15538,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should decentraland marketplace have an option for leasing names ?,"> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (BobRoss)

Many feel left out on owning their desired names in DCL.  This is due to early adopters scooping up most of these premium/platinum names during the official launch in 2020. Lately I am noticing almost all new users with guest names. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is affordability due to requiring 100 Mana + Gas to claim a name. Another reason is most likely because the name they want has already been claimed by another user. Perhaps the last reason is name price on the secondary market is well above their threshold.

Here is why I believe there should be a marketplace for leasing DCL Names:

*   Allow new users to experience what it feels like owning a name at 1/10th or 1/100th of the actual minting price.

*   Give someone the pleasure of having their dream name inside the metaverse.

*   Provide awareness, liquidity,  volume & activity in names market.

*   Incentive and passive income for anyone who owns two names or more.

*   Possibility for leasing names in L2 Polygon (Matic) with almost no fees. (technically may or may not be possible)

*   Great model for pop-up, one time events where that name is required or relevant for that event.

Leasing options can be 1 day, 1 week, 1 month etc.. I longer the term of the lease cheaper it becomes.

Lately we've seen some aggressive price changing on items in a way that may be perceived as deceptive.  Specifically, listing free items and quickly swapping prices in order to quickly net sales on items which were otherwise not selling.

It is fair to add limitations of one price edit per 24 hours.

The goal is to keep our marketplace clean of deceptive and unfair sales tactics, which might only worsen if not addressed.

Moving forward, I’d like to begin focusing my content strictly around Decentraland as many of my viewers enjoy that the most. The main goal is to make content that helps people become more familiar and comfortable in DCL as they begin their Metaverse journey.

Hi, I would like for users who can design their own wearables to be allowed to upload the files and dress their avatar ; Then these uploaded items COULD  or COULDN't be available for sale to others that can't design but love an avatar wearable which is not in the market place they can ask to purchase the item direct from user and not just from market place. This would be such a cool feature in DCL .  So there could be 2 ways to sell or buy wearables. From market place or from user page. Is it hard to implement this ??

- User can upload items and use only for their own avatar
- User can also sell their uploaded items that their avatar wears if others wish to have same items
- Invalid question/options

[Improved backpack features](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8461fe90-dcec-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)

## Summary

Improved backpack features


## Abstract

The reason for this proposal is to streamline the gameplay of users.

I come to propose 2 points that I consider essential:

Allow to sort wearables in the overview by received date and by rarity, be able to customize.

Allow customization of the avatar, so that a set of clothes is saved. An example: 2 customizations (one for party outfits and one for Wonderzone).

This would free the user a lot from choosing clothes for the bonuses, or searching through so many wearables.


## Motivation

It is extremely necessary, since searching through all the wearables is somewhat uncomfortable.

It would make the game much easier.

This would free the user a lot from choosing clothes for the bonuses, or searching through so many wearables.


## Conclusion

The conclusion of all this is to be able to order by type of wearable (epic, rare, legendary...) order by date of entry of the wearable, order by ""listed for sale"" or ""not listed"" and to be able to create clothing outfits for directly change the entire avatar with one click.

Complete clothing customizations

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Create a task force to develop and maintain a public registry of individuals and organizations offering their services to build content on Decetraland’s platform. The goal is to connect brands coming into the space with talented builders who can help with events production, wearables making, 3D modeling and SDK programming.

## Description

As the Metaverse concept goes mainstream there are more and more brands coming into the space willing to build a presence in Decentraland. However, creating 3D content can be a daunting task and most organizations will prefer to hire experienced professionals.

Decentraland creators are one of the most valuable audiences Decentraland has at this point. It is crucial to have a dedicated team to support them and promote their services, effectively helping them to grow into a sustainable business.

Creating a public and official registry of Verified Partners will promote transparency between brands and creators. With this initiative, we aim to democratize access to qualified suppliers and generate new sources of business opportunities for them.

The first goal of this team is to survey all creators in the Decentraland community and list them in a public registry of creators, the Verified Partners Registry. The team will also provide support and foster networking opportunities between the partners community.

A second goal of the team is to do an outreach to brands willing to invest in their online presence. The team will create a strategy to market the services provided by the verified partners, onboarding brands, and position Decentraland as a great place to build.


## Specification

This grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds in its objectives.

The proposed Partner Support Squad will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the  [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7). This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.

The grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet. The key holders are Bianca Monti, Yemel Jardi and maraoz in their respective capacities as Squad Lead, DAO Committee Member and Trusted Community Member.

The public registry will first launch as a dedicated page on Decentraland’s documentation site, a testing version of it is  [already available here](https://docs.decentraland.vote/talent-hub/). Once a substantial number of providers are included and the services they provide are surveyed, the team will plan the migration of the directory to its own domain for a richer experience (searching, filtering, applying, and more).


## Personnel

The team is made up of two departments and a project manager to coordinate their efforts:

*   Business Development: Two experienced producers will dedicate 60hrs per week to verify partners and create business opportunities for them.

*   Marketing: Two experienced marketers who will be working 20 hrs per week on designing and implementing communication strategies to onboard new partners and brands. They will manage a monthly budget to produce content and advertise it.

Team members:

*   Project Manager - Bianca Monti ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bianca-monti-06944784/) )
*   Producer - Agustin Pagano - ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agustinpz/) )

*   Marketer - Ramiro Valverde ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramiro-valverde-00a65854/) )

Total Hours: ~440 monthly hours or ~110 weekly hours.
Budget: $19,700 USD per month or a total of $118,200 USD

This includes:

*   Team compensation: $97,200 USD
*   Marketing Budget: $18,000 USD
*   Operational expenses: $3,000


## Roadmap and milestones

During the 6 months of this project the team will focus on:

*   Bootstrap the **Verified Partners Registry.**
    1.  Contact all Decentraland creators and survey the services they provide.
    2.  Develop a process/criteria to verify the partners and previous experience.
    3.  Review applications from potential partners to join the registry.
    4.  Evaluate results and propose a definition for the next version of the registry.

*   Market the **Verified Partners Registry** to several audiences.
    1.  Reach out to all studios and freelancers already providing services for other metaverses in the industry.
    2.  Educate brands about the possibility of building a presence in the metaverse.
    3.  Create business opportunities by connecting brands with relevant verified partners.

*   Support the partners' community & foster networking opportunities
    1.  Discover the needs and opportunities to empower/boost the partners' community.
    2.  Host regular online meetings between the partners' community to share knowledge and present relevant initiatives.
    3.  Collaborate with the DCL Foundation Marketing team to amplify partners' announcements and achievements.
    4.  Collaborate with DCL Foundation Engineering teams to provide technical support to verified partners and summarize feedback about DCL tools usage.

Finally, the team will plan the next iteration of the registry, which might include the migration to its own site and the inclusion of the DAO in the process of adding/removing members of the registry.

## Description

Full Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/toolbox-ce.md

### Actions To Be Added

##### Face player

The target item will rotate towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.

##### Face Item

The target item will rotate towards the target item at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player

##### Move to player

The target item will move towards the player who invoked it at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player

##### Move to item

The target item will move towards the item at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.

##### Note on above

All of the above face/move actions will include lock X, Y, Z-axis which do as they suggest.  It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction).

##### Follow Item Path

The target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.

##### Motion Control

Allows a player to pause, stop, resume an action

##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem)

Currently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.

##### Add Attach/Detach Item

Will attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.

##### Scene Add/remove

Action will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.


## Specification

### Demo / POC

I started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here

\[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)

I estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.   I am optimistic that this proposal will be approved because I believe in the value of adding the toolbox functionality (I have already logged more hours than I probably should have not knowing if this will be funded or not).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize my work and make it available as outlined in the deliverables below.

### My Portfolio

I won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.

https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/
View it in the scene pool here \[https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)

I have made improvements to existing smart items.\
https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27

Another contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.  You can find my submission here:
https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/a1890011-77d7-415c-aeb2-452e3a186391?realm=localhost-stub.  Again I used the Builder and but this time also the SDK to enhance the Voxter smart item given to the contestants improving its experience and features in the Builder.  Enhancements can be found here:
https://github.com/pabloes/voxters/pull/2


## Roadmap and milestones

### Time to Complete

I am past the 70% completion mark already.  I estimate at most more 2-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted (sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :) ).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize the work I have already started and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.

### Deliverables

The code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here. https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: ""smart-items"" since that is what they are and ""ce""  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/

I will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.

Dozens of early contributors have no VP for their contribution whereas some district leaders have 100,000's of thousands or even millions of VP with minimal contributions during terraforming.

I believe having all VP from land that was formed for districts being held by district leaders is centralizing power and makes it very difficult for community members to  enact changes that they feel would benefit the community.  It also makes some district leaders able to control voting with very little contributions to receive that power.

I propose we revise VP in relationship to district leaders and district contributors.  We cannot have a district leader that has more power than the entire community that created it, let alone all the power.

- Contributors receive VP based on contribution * bonus to equal District Leader
- Contributors receive VP based on contribution at the cost of a reduction of district leaders
- No change in VP - Early contributors continue to have little sway in decisions

## NFT Collections Description

The Metaverse Travel Agency is a cyberpunk-themed wearable NFT collection featuring 6,000 unique wearable Metahelmets. We have a passionate community of holders who are champing at the bit to get their helmets into DCL and start exploring. We launched the project in October of 2021, and since then we've built this community around our stellar design as well as our mission to create wearables you can take anywhere in the metaverse - unique avatars you can maintain across metaverses as your ""perma-identity."" Linked wearables in DCL is integral to that vision! We've purchased 6 plots of land in DCL and are launching a massive HQ for the project in a few short weeks where we'll host tons of awesome events, quests, and game for our holders!

## Motivation

Kollectiff is a Web3 design brand that's been partnered with Decentraland since our inception. We're dedicated to creating unique wearables and interactive experiences that you can bring anywhere in the metaverse. We partnered with DCL for the fashion festival in March where we built ""The Metaloop"" - a fashion runway event that featured dozens of quality digital fashion brands (Perry Ellis, IKKS, Anrealage, Cider, DressX, and more). We helped these brands build their DCL wearables and bring them onto the platform. We also built Acura's DCL HQ which just launched. We plan to bring more big brands into DCL, and we'd love to have the opportunity to bring our own wearable NFT collection in a continued collaboration with the DCL community!

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

ART|DAO is a battle concept that pits two artists' submissions against each other. The winner sells their art to the DAO.  DCL players show up to the battles and vote using a custom implementation of POAP booths and scoreboards.  I run a podcast called ART|DAI on TokenSmart which happens during the battle which attracts extra players.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xd5879eCb96DF9a3c4584d7e1A49Ee53ba94104D3

## Description

We will use the $3000 to purchase the winner's art up to $250 per battle(1/week) for 3 months.  This will be an important time(summer for the U.S.) to continue to attract/grow the player base in DCL.


## Specification

We'll be bringing on celebrity curators for the battles,  participants(voters) will also be encouraged to take screenshots and tag DCL on Twitter for extra prizes.  At the end of the 3 months the grant wallet will have 12 pieces from artists, which we can either keep or transfer to the DCL DAO.


## Personnel

@bake_eth is my co-founder and helps with the overall UX
You can check out https://artordai.xyz to see battles already completed or stop by (38,103) to see the set.


## Roadmap and milestones

Given the set's proximity to marketplaces in DCL, I will attempt to engage them to receive further sponsorship.  The community will see players' screenshots of the battles on a weekly basis and will have access to .csv files from the POAP's for verification if needed.

The key component here is staying true to #web3 and rewarding artists for their content. All grant money will be spent on purchasing works of art for the DAO. At the end of the 3 months we will apply for another larger grant if the concept proves to be popular. Any left over money at the end of the 3 months will be used on extra battles.  Any remaining proceeds(after applicable taxes) collected from the sale of art from the DAO will fund new battles.

A new contract that allows for publishers to choose any number of mint options. This is more of a personal reason as a creator. Those mint options do not make sense most of the time with publishments.

I rarely can make sense of an NFT in Decentraland with a 100 mints, 1000 mints, or 5,000 mints. The numbers are way too broad.

The current alternative options are

1.  To create and burn them. Which makes the color system irrelevant anyway. (Many creators have already done this.)

2.  Create your own contract and go through the Linked wearables registry. (Honestly just a laughable attempt option.)

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

This grant proposal is meant to help funding further development of DCL-Edit over the next six months. DCL-Edit is the visual scene editor for the Decentraland SDK, developed by members of the MetaGameHub DAO (see https://dcl-edit.com).


## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D

## Description

Over the last months, we have been working on DCL-Edit, a visual editor that runs locally on your PC, allowing you to build and code your scene with the Decentraland SDK in parallel.

Giving you the typical workflow of well known state-of-the-art game engines, the current stable base version already greatly boosts productivity.

Since the release of the first stable version (check out our previous grant for the base version of DCL-Edit: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0cb35ba0-7e05-11ec-9447-6b730f00647d), we’ve added a couple of additional features like materials, improved UI and a prototype scene importer.

The journey has just begun, though. Although significantly boosting your productivity already, DCL-Edit still has so much potential. We’re about to get this tool to the next level. Based on the feedback from the developer community, we now put together a roadmap for the next six months to establish DCL-Edit as a professional, reliable and highly productive tool for Decentraland.

To reach our goal, a big refactoring for DCL-Edit is required. That means some significant chunks of the editor will be rewritten from the ground up, which will require some time. But fear not, we will keep updating the current version with bug fixes and smaller features as needed.


## Specification

DCL-Edit is developed in Unity and can be downloaded as a npm package. It's currently running on Windows only (about to change) and it is licensed under the MIT license.

Current list of features:

*   place, transform, scale, and rotate entities
*   assign identifiers to entities to instantly use in code
*   add basic shape components
*   assign to and manipulate materials of entities
*   asset browser for GLTF shapes
*   undo functionality
*   parenting of objects


## Personnel

We are developing this as representatives of the MetaGameHub DAO, a community that is heavily involved in the evolving Metaverse and Blockchain Space (check out https://www.metagamehub.io).

*   Christian Werner (Project Manager)
*   Jonathan Lübeck (Lead Developer)
*   Michael Rust (Code Architecture)
*   Vanessa Miske (UX/UI)
*   Michael Gantner (Developer)
*   Vincent Labuhn (Developer)

we also plan to hire additional developers after the initial refactoring iteration


## Roadmap and milestones

### July, August

*   Refactoring - New Architecture
*   establish CI/CD workflow
*   scene importer - import existing scenes from the Decentraland Builder
*   add Mac / Linux support

### September, October

Advanced Asset Management:

*   new asset types: textures, materials, scenes (which will allow including existing scenes in another scene)
*   GLTF compatibility
*   live model update
*   sorting and filtering of assets
*   build optimizations

Component Generalization:

*   having more components available out of the box
    e.g. audio sources, and utility components like trigger boxes
*   component description interface to make custom components available

### November, December

*   Usability / User Interface Improvements
*   interface for loading / organizing backups (history, settings, …)
*   advanced control settings (keyboard shortcuts, mouse settings)
*   improved Gizmo tools
*   testing phase

The first step is a bigger refactoring iteration - the code needs to be cleaned up, and we need a nice CI/CD workflow established for higher development and testing efficiency.

We'll then port the tool to Mac and Linux before starting with major improvement on the asset management, entity components, and overall usability / productivity.

We are regularly synchronizing with the Decentraland Devs, e.g. during the weekly dev meetings on Wednesdays, so it might of course happen that other currently undefined features may be prioritized over the listed features when found necessary.

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

We’re seeking funding for the development of a party game. The game is Mafia – social deduction game, modeling a conflict between two groups, the mafiosi and villagers. The game has two alternating phases: first, a night phase, during which those with night killing powers may covertly kill other players, and second, a day phase, in which surviving players debate the identities of players and vote to eliminate a suspect.
For now, we want to create a simple working build, to see how it works and see community reaction. If it receives good feedback, we will continue development, create 3d models, polish and add more mechanics to it.


## Grant size

3,200 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x7dC0c1E2F54b619B423104c77c9783B1716640a5

## Description

Mafia is a social deduction game about a conflict between two groups of people, playing against each other during two alternating phases. In a classic version of the game, win conditions are met by eliminating the opponent group. But we want to make it possible to join a game instance that has already started.


## Specification

Game mechanic

Minimum is 4 players. A game is usually played by 7-16 people. With fewer players games tend to be too short, with more players – game loses meaning. For this version 4 players for a start should be enough.
A player get near a table, click on it, gets a message in a window if he is able to join a game instance. Users are able to join during a certain phase of the game. If there are not enough players in a game instance, the user will receive a message that he has to wait until more people join.

Zero phase – Players are waiting when there will be enough people to join. Players receive roles. Roles are assigned randomly, max number of mafia is limited by a formula:  M  = N / K
Where M = number of mafia members. N = all players. K = minimum players.
First phase – Night. Mafia picks a victim silently by voting collectively. A majority of votes defines a victim. If the mafia does not reach consensus within a given period of time, no one gets killed.
Second phase – Day. A victim gets the final word, allowed to talk for a minute, and then gets kicked out of the game. During this period, anyone can join. New players get roles. Mafia gets informed what roles new players get.
Then everyone has a discussion, and votes for accusing a player of being a mafia member. A player accused by a majority of players gets excluded.

If a mafia member disconnects, this mafia member will be announced as dead. If a villager disconnects, the villager will be announced as dead. The game continues as long as there are still mafia members and villagers, and there are less mafia members than villagers.

After the games ends, users get info about games results. A new round begins, players get new roles. If there are not enough players, players get the message that they should wait for 2-3 players.

New players that just entered a game will be given the roles of villagers or mafiosi, villagers are not going to know what roles are given to new players, or players that rejoined a game. That way, it will make it easier for people to find people to play with, users won’t have to look for another lobby if there is an already going game.

If within a single scene, several games will be played, voice chat can be disturbing, so it will be blocked within a scene.

Planned features

This project, aside from Mafia gameplay, will introduce an ability to kick people from a scene via a voting system. Currently, in Decentraland to kick users, one, or a few predefined users have to be given admin rights, which is convenient for small events, but not for an extended period of time.
Voting to kick players that are ruining others' experience from a scene can help people to moderate scenes, to have a better time playing.
We plan to give the Decentraland community one more place, where people can play and interact with each other, to create a meaningful scene.


## Personnel

We are M-social Production, web and web3 developers, we have been doing digital projects since 2008.
There will be 4 people engaged in development:

*   Frontend dev
*   Backend dev
*   QA specialist
*   Project manager

If you want to know more about our experience, you can visit our website: https://msocialproduction.com


## Roadmap and milestones

We expect a working alpha to be done within 3 weeks.
Within 2 weeks, we plan to make the functional code. Next, we will test it and fix bugs that will pop up. We’re not planning to create a 3d model for interior and exterior for the alpha version.
To give players a motivation to join back into a game instance, and to motivate users to play in general, we plan to implement a play-to-earn mechanic. Players will gain points for surviving a set number of phases, and for meeting win conditions. Play-to-earn mechanic can be further improved.

15567,15567,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Updating Fee Structure for Wearable Secondary Sales,"> by 0xb3ab3a2f58a7d91fe3dcf9abad53c0dd1603b847 (Reyean)

Wearables sales are booming in Decentraland (DCL) as platform adoption increases and since support for Polygon (Matic) Wearables was added. Upon Wearable submission, DCL receives 500 MANA from the content creator, and, from there, if approved and minted, the proceeds from the Primary Sale of the wearable go to the content creator.

For Secondary Sales of ETH Mainnet Wearables on OpenSea, 2.5% goes to OpenSea and nothing goes to DCL. For Secondary Sales of Matic Wearables on OpenSea, the situation is reversed: 2.5% goes to DCL and nothing goes to OpenSea.

You can view DCL's proceeds from these secondary sales here: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9a6ebe7e2a7722f8200d0ffb63a1f6406a0d7dce#tokentxns

In both cases, however, no secondary sale proceeds go to the content creator. This poll/proposal focuses on Matic Wearables and suggests no changes to the ETH Mainnet Wearables Secondary Sales logic. For Matic Wearables, a few options are:

(1) Keep everything as is
(2) Keep 2.5% Total Fee, but Give to Content Creator
(3) Add 2.5% Fee for Content Creator to Existing 2.5% Fee to DCL

Looking forward to seeing the discussion around this as well as hearing from the DCL Foundation the feasibility of each approach. At the outset, I'm personally leaning toward option (2) in order to keep total fees low.

- Keep Fee As Is
- Keep 2.5% Total Fee, but Give to Content Creator
- Add 2.5% Fee for Content Creator to Existing 2.5% Fee to DCL

## Abstract

At MetaPlay, we are creating one of the first intelligent & independent virtual companions. This was made possible by embedding an innovative state-of-the-art AI code into our first chicken NFTs. The CryptoChicken plays and interacts with the owner and its environment, bridging the gap of static pets with limited functionality in the Metaverse. Our team currently has a small staff of talented individuals with a variety of significant capabilities. Each member comes from multiple types of professional formations such as finance, web development, and business studies, besides having worked with multiple noteworthy businesses. Our vision is to empower Decentraland's community with smart and interactive pets that have yet to tread on this land.

## Description

Hello fellow Decentralanders! We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!

TheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating one of Decentraland's first pets that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect its overall statistics. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another right in Decentraland! Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future ""winky face"".

We believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!

Upon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 75%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new Daily Active Users to DCL. The 60k will spend as follows over a 6 month period.

20k backend development = 3,3k/month

10K graphics + animation = 1.6k/month

5k web development = 800$/month

15k marketing = 2.5k/month

5k  Discord maintenance = 900$/month

5k  Miscellaneous development expenses = 900$/month


## Specification

Our developer and designer are world class professionals with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND and the project's upcoming partners. To check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below) (INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner, wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click ""summon your chicken"". Disclaimer: we have yet to add additional AI functionalities and coloring to the chicken, but will do so immediately following our first drop. The first drop will be a wearable in the form of a gold chain that enables your pet chicken to show up behind you once equipped on your avatar.)

9.  Jan 2022 -  [Resignation of Eric from the DAO Committee.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705)

The main responsibilities of the DAO Committee are:

*   Moderate proposals in the governance platform (promote to enacted, passed, rejected)
*   Keep updated the list of POIs, BanNames and Catalysts.
*   Create and fund vesting contracts for paying grants.
*   Calculate and execute compensation for the Wearables Curation Committee.
*   Pay the DAO Facilitator a monthly compensation.
*   Use the DAO Treasury (release vesting, transfers to operational wallet, swap funds).
*   Reimburse gas fees to the DAO Committee.

Some other task related to the role are:

*   Attend monthly Town Halls and provide general community support.
*   Give feedback to proposals, evaluate risks and implementations pathways.
*   Contact external organizations in the name of the DAO.

So far we enacted 181 proposals, distributed as follow:

*   81 POIs added
*   50 grants paid
*   39 polls were enacted
*   10 names banned
*   1 catalyst update

In the past year I have sent 414 transactions from my  [DAO Committee wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc)  in the name of the DAO. Thanks to the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees, this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and **those efforts are not being compensated in any form**. I believe this is a problem for the long-term sustainable operation of the DAO.

Adding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement that can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.

**I believe we need to start compensating the DAO Committee members and set the grounds for a sustainable DAO Committee. What do you think? I’m open to questions and feedback.**

- Compensate members of the DAO Committee 
- Keep this role voluntary
- Invalid question/options

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Create a governance facilitation unit to support operation of the Decentraland DAO.


## Grant size

75,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x0D109CD701946D4cFE1a687b80b59Ca80732fAC5

## Description

This proposal is to establish a **DAO Facilitation Squad** to expand on the role previously served by an individual DAO Facilitator. The role of the DAO facilitation team will be to help identity and express community stakeholder interests in well thought out and implementable governance proposals, build consensus and facilitate working groups to resolve issues of importance in the Decentraland ecosystem, host monthly town hall meetings and maintain a persistent presence in the DAO Discord server, drive the DAOs externally facing strategic communications, and help mediate relations between the DAO Community, DAO Committee and Decentraland Foundation.

Establishment of the DAO Facilitation Squad is part of a broader process to organize DAO operations around “Core Units,” which additionally include the **DAO Governance Squad** and the **Grants Support Team**. Each of these Core Units will serve six month terms, and be funded through the DAO’s standard grantmaking process.

Despite its name, the operation of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is in large part a human process. While some view decentralization and automation through maximalist lenses, as the Decentraland DAO facilitator and an academic political theorist, I believe decentralization is as much an ethos as it is a system, and automation is about augmenting human processes to decrease friction and increase governing efficiency. As a result, engaged facilitation is an essential part of decentralized governance, particularly in virtual distributed systems such as Decentraland.


## Specification

This grant will set up a budget to run the DAO Facilitation Team for a period of 6 months. The proposed team will be managed by the current DAO Facilitator, Matimio, and the grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins distributed to a wallet used solely for the purposes of receiving and distributing grant funds to team members.

The Governance Facilitation Squad will focus on two primary functions: **Operations** and **Research & Analytics**.

*   The Operations Team will be responsible for strategic communications, marketing, and DAO Discord server moderation and engagement. [( Link )](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOeomRcA=/?share_link_id=184697690463)
*   The Analytics & Research Team will be responsible for proposal writing, working group facilitation, proposal impact assessment and implementation research and DAO Discord server moderation and engagement. [( Link )](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOvsEcOM=/?share_link_id=435185352063)

Governance Facilitators will provide the opportunity for a working group to be created in the DAO Discord server following passage of an initial governance poll. They will engage with interested stakeholders until the issue is promoted through the governance stages, or fails to pass to the subsequent stage.

The Governance Squad [( Link )](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=524fb800-d532-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0), Grants Support Squad [( Link )](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7a236540-d305-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0), and Governance Facilitation Squad will make up three **Core Units** of the DAO, which will coordinate to maintain effective and efficient operations, and represent Decentraland Community interests.

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

I have a Twitter page where I make daily videos about upcoming events in Decentraland. The main purpose of my page is to make easier for the everyday user to know more about the current events of the day, with informative short videos about the events details and artist's background (if any performing). Think of it as the live events list, but with subtitled videos explaining them.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xBD03aDd5da0e173C67C9C1073FFBA017147c42d4

## Description

One thing I noticed is that somedays it can get hard to keep track of events! My goal is to make the event page more digestable for the average user, by visually explaining the activities of the day.

Currently I'm doing AT LEAST 3x subtitled videos per day, the next step is doubling that. My goal is to bring more awareness to the whole community overall.


## Specification

If the grant is approved, i'll expand the team to cover the entire events page every single day. I aim to create translated videos to the Brazilian audience and expand to tiktok and youtube shorts. I'll also invest in paid ads for both pages monthly.

Twitter page: https://twitter.com/DclHighlights


## Personnel

My name is Vapo and I create videos by myself. I've been working fulltime in metaverse-related content since december 2021, contributing with videos and advertisement in different projects.

My objective is to become a steady source of video news about Decentraland events. I want to continue creating relevant content everyday in multiple platforms to bring new users and keep current players updated as much as possible!


## Roadmap and milestones

I will post new subtitled content (minimum) 6 times PER DAY in multiple platforms (youtube, tiktok and twitter).

I will also report progress at the end of every week.

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[Keep Polygon transactions free](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d958c3e0-c278-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)

## Summary

The DAO will subside polygon transactions for Decentraland users


## Abstract

The DAO will fund the Gas tank for Polygon meta transactions in order to keep a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry for publishing, listing, bidding, and buying wearables in exchange for MANA between others.


## Motivation

This is a follow-up from this [past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7af34c90-5d1e-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7), where a Grant was given by the DAO to keep Polygon transactions in Decentraland free for all its users. Free transactions mean that the Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction (in Polygon) they perform while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera.

Decentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.

The way Biconomy works is by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**


## Specification

Up until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth.

It’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp.

The Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and the flywheel could keep spinning: better UX > > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.


## Conclusion

If this proposal closes and the result is ""YES"",  the DAO Committee will be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Decentraland can benefit from an immersive builder and viewer that empowers people to easily build environments and create interactive experiences within a VR and AR headset.

The developers of Byldr (https://www.byldr.app/) are requesting a grant to enable Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland and for it to be used to experience Decentraland in VR.

Byldr is a free, no-code immersive app and scene creation tool that is currently available for the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets. Having launched in 2020, it currently has over 5000+ downloads and has been used to create VR games and enterprise-grade applications. The Byldr team is excited to bring more VR and AR capabilities to Decentraland for a fully realized Metaverse experience.


## Grant size

220,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x9A739c2e212754c3d8432CB717dC9437e5b3Dfae

## Description

Byldr's creators believe that the future of computing involves the movement away from traditional 2D screens and towards immersive, 3D spatial computing. As of this writing, Decentraland is a 3D metaverse that ironically can only be experienced and built through a flat, 2D screen. Byldr was created for AR and VR applications to be created using AR and VR headsets rather than 2D PCs, thereby getting humanity one step closer to a mixed reality future. Byldr's developers seek to further expand this progress by enabling creators to build experiences for Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. This allows creators to feel the scale of their creations while creating it, and accelerate the speed of creation using Byldr's intuitive hand-tracking interactions and spatial tools. Creators will be able to see or preview their creations in-context within Decentraland using Byldr. This means that Byldr may also be used as a gateway to experience Decentraland using the Quest 2 and the HoloLens 2.

The Byldr development team is excited to bring our trusted immersive creation experience to Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.


## Specification

Byldr's development team proposes to integrate with Decentraland in the following ways:

1.  Allow experiences and scenes created using Byldr to be exported to Decentraland.
    Byldr will be retooled to be able to export creations built using Byldr into Decentraland. After a user has created an interactive or static experience within Byldr, the user will have the option to export that experience to Decentraland, including where the experience will be placed. Users will also be able to edit or update these experiences after being published. Byldr will be updated to tightly integrate with Decentraland with the goal of making Byldr feel like a native extension for building Decentraland experiences.

2.  Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.) Some of these techniques may involve more aggressive culling of faraway objects, using mobile-optimized shaders, distance-based level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, foveated rendering, and other techniques.

15577,15577,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Balanced Voting Power in Decentraland,"> by 0x785c8d210ab8888da6d121faa0a9568f75400b13 (VinnyPiazza)

**SUMMARY**

The goal of this proposal is the balancing of Voting Power across the Decentraland community regardless of contribution method; investor, creator, or consumer. I am proposing a more balanced Voting Power allocation, should the methods of the proposed allocations be feasible and amendable.

Preserving a near relative Voting Power for current leading voters is essential to gain support on getting a more balanced voting system approved and implemented. This proposal conserves the Voting Power of leading voters and adds additional voting power through creative balancing while preventing material dilution.

**ABSTRACT**

There is an imbalance of Voting Power favoring those with large amounts of MANA or LAND creating a perceived class war. Understanding that MANA and LAND are investments in DCL, they deserve fair Voting Power but no one DCL contribution asset should overshadow the community as a whole. All stakeholders should have an equitable say.

**Current:**

*   1 MANA contributes 1 VP
*   1 NAME contributes 100 VP
*   1 LAND parcel contributes 2000 VP
*   Each Estate is worth 2000 multiplied by the number of single LAND parcels in that Estate. For example, an Estate with 2 parcels will contribute 4000 VP to your total voting power.

**In the Works:**

*   Some L1 wearables will get additional VP based on proposal ""Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections"".

**SPECIFICATION**

By adding additional voting rights through new allocations using relative contribution and vested interest factors, it disperses the Voting Power across the community in a more equitable way.

**Proposed Additions:**
In addition to current Voting Power allocation…

*   1 MANA spent in DCL contributes 1.5 VP (new)
*   1 WEARABLES CREATED contributes 100 VP (new)
*   1 EMOTES CREATED contributes 100 VP (new)
*   ACTIVE DAYS in Decentraland contributes = 1 VP per day (new)
*   DOB of Decentraland Character = 0.5 VP per day (new)

NAME and LAND owners would be getting a small inherent multiplier for both spending MANA and having their respective Decentraland assets. An additional inherent multiplier is the MANA from LAND proceeds, such as renting, that the asset owner continues to hold in their DCL connected wallet.

WEARABLE CREATORS would be getting a inherent multiplier for both spending MANA (in DCL) and being a content creator for DCL. An additional multiplier is the MANA proceeds from wearable sales that continue to be held in their DCL connected wallet.

These are reasonable inherent multipliers that give greater weight to those that have long term horizons on the success of DCL. These investments are not as easy to divest giving them more incentive for long term growth of Decentraland.

**MOTIVATION**

This proposal for balancing Voting Power in Decentraland gives investors, creators, & consumers more equitable voting power allowing for the voices and opinions of the community to be heard. This creates a vested interest in the betterment of Decentraland and ultimately more engagement. This promotes investments that create stickiness to DCL which increases the value of past contributions (investments) in DCL. Some of the additional Voting Power also promotes spending in Decentraland which gives the DAO more revenue to service DCL.

I would expect future proposals for re-balancing as the community and its contributing members grow, however the members choose to contribute.

15578,15578,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Add HirotoKai to the Wearables Curation Committee,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Summary**

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The [Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/) was formed to help with this process.

There are currently only three individuals sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the [call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047),  HirotoKai was nominated:

""HK's dedication to the DCL Community, specifically with regards to wearables creation, has been immense and is not unnoticed. HK is active with creation solo and in-collaboration with others. Additionally, HK is consistently supporting others projects, addressing questions, and hosts wearable educational tutorials too. Much respect to HirotoKai!""

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the [DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b) to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

Should the following Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

As our previous Approved Grant, we would like to continue to produce content for Decentraland and request funds. this time to produce 36 more videos

The previous grant requested funds for 10 videos, from which we were actually able to produce 20 videos, releasing 2 videos per week.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmnqSRvd6bbJgmlS6A8BNw

We would like to ensure we can continue to publish content twice a week for the remainder of the year (18 more weeks in 2021, total of 36 videos)

As the previous grant, we would request $50/video, which equals $1,800 in MANA.

Thank you for continuing to support what we do at The Decentraland Report to record and publish the story we are creating together!

## Description

In our last grant we requested grant funding to cover 10 videos for The Decentraland Report, this was to be over the course of 5 weeks. The grant was for the amount of $500 in MANA.

In such, we have successfully produced more results than we aimed for:
Total Decentraland Videos Created: 20

The cost to produce this many videos and managing social media over the course of 1 month is substantially higher than $25/video, which in the end was the outcome of the cost expenditure with this grant.

In such, this grant can represent a net positive outcome for Decentraland and we would like to continue to produce this content as there are not currently many others consistently doing so. The Decentraland Report has provided an inclusive and positive environment for people to discover Decentraland and would like to continue to find ways to connect it to new community members.

36 More Videos to cover Video Editor from September through end of 2021.


## Specification

Stefan Kime, the same editor from our previous grant, has been working hard to publish edited videos from our LIVE Streams we do at The Decentraland Report twice a week.

We will also be bringing on new reporters and in such, Stefan will be able to tie together videos from different Reports into one highlight real of all happening throughout the week in Decentraland.


## Personnel

Our platform provide support for sellers, landlords, buyers & tenants, looking to start their adventure in Decentraland. DCL Real Estate enables a great LAND experience for O.G. DCL users, but also new outside buyers, tenants, investors & big companies to expand the Decentraland community & land sale. We provide sales-support, rental support aswell as buying & tenant advise, when looking to get into Decentraland, as a newcomer.

DCL Real Estate would want a grant for a smart-contract system, that will provide more financial security to new DCL Investors, maximizing the utility and enlightening outside investors to invest in DCL LAND, for both sale & rent.

## Description

DCL Real Estate - https://dclrealestate.org/

DCL Real Estate, is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get outside investors, to invest in Decentraland. We would need a grant, to expand the security within our large sums of transaction when doing land-deals & rentals, to secure payments when doing transactions between three parts. (example).

We're having daily 5-10 new users to Decentraland looking to learn more, buy, rent etc. So we are educating outside investors aswell as helping sellers & landlords to get their land to profit. Therefor with a smart-contract system helping us securing funds for the landlord, the seller and ourself (commission) would be a next-level in our field.

We have been talking with developers, saying it is possible to create such a smart-contract system. Example, if a tenant wants to rent this case: https://dclrealestate.org/lands-for-sale/case-id.516

He would then just press ""rent"", and the funds will automaticly be payed to the landlord directly, every month and also our cut. This means no manual transactions, and will provide A LOT of security to our clients.

For our future roadmap, we would allow EXTERNAL brokers, to use our site and smart-contract system, to benefit Decentraland the most, with as many brokers as possible promoting DCL to outside investors, looking to learn more. We have a lot of companies, that contact us - they have no clue where to start, and that's where we're helping them from A-Z, and our main requests are why we haven't a secure smart-contract in place.

Our results so far, have been 5 sold lands, and 5 lands rented out.

To show our results so far, with how much we contribute to DCL our transperent income can be viewed here: https://imgur.com/a/Fm4kMCm


## Specification

We will complete the project, together with external developers that will help us establish, an external marketplace for rent, for sale that will allow a contract with 3 people within it. This will allow brokers, sellers, buyers, tenants & landlords to have a good & safe experience, while dealing with land - and to prevent scammers, being able to act as a random broker.


## Personnel

Partner - Klockmann (Real Estate Agent)
Partner - Laursen (Real Estate Agent)
Creator Agent - MetaWear (Content Creator)
Developer - We have gotten offers from experienced & known contract developers.


## Roadmap and milestones

The timelime of this project:

*   August 2022: Development finished, and launch of new security platform
*   December 2022: Open Broker Site for DCL, to allow them using the platform
*   2023: Allow all DCL users, to use the site as an external marketplace (with extra sales- and newbie help from hired Agents)

### Description

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, Yannakis (<https://decentralwear.io/>), 3D Artist and wearable creator was nominated:

This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

We are working on various Chinese social media, including WeChat, bilibili, and Red to let more people know and explore Decentraland. Within one month, we have built up a community of nearly 2,000 people who hold great passion for Web3 on WeChat and attracted more than 1,500 followers on other Chinese platforms.  When Decentraland launches its new events, or some well-known brands have stepped into Decentraland, we make videos to show the upcoming or ongoing events in Decentraland to attract potential players.

In addition, we will teach community members to get into Decentraland and know this amazing world. We have already attracted several brands and IPs which intend to establish their presence in DCL.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x8c127AB5762CB50C993a198b6187c0833746e404

## Description

When Decentraland launches its new events, or some well-known brands have stepped into Decentraland, we make videos to show the upcoming or ongoing events or the scenes in Decentraland. This allows more people to see the newest brands in Decentraland and the new Metaverse spaces that have been created and to join and immerse themselves in the ongoing events in Decentraland. We have already made four editions of our Metaverse Fashion Week Tour series, tours to TX Huaihai, The University of Hong Kong Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, and the Cannes Film Festival, which have been shown in three editions. Altogether, a cumulative total of 2,000 followers and a total viewership of over 10k.

The problem we found is that sometimes it can be hard for us to visit all the scenes and make videos, for instance, during the MVFW. Our next step is to show more spaces and events in Decentraland to bring more awareness to the whole community.

Besides, on our WeChat and Discord communities, we have only 3 moderators of 2000 members, and all of us are working hard every day to bring news about Decentraland and help the new players to start, things like how to create your avatar, how to buy MANA and wearables, how to create wearable and build your scene on the Builder... Also, our community is growing fast and we need people to be focused on these new members.

Several links to our previous videos:

## Specification

If the grant is approved, I'll expand the team to cover more events in Decentraland. I'll pay the moderators to be motivated and also have more time in there helping the new members and bringing the news every day.

This grant is enough to pay the cost for 3 months.


## Personnel

BEAM studio is a globally-based studio. BEAM Studio originated from a global community of high-quality creators, where we are committed to exploring brand-new ways digital natives interact with information, space, and each other, as our name suggests, Build Exciting Adventures in Metaverse. Meanwhile, we aim to bring together global creators to create various experiences to promote the process of metaverse construction and build virtual worlds beyond imagination.

Now it has expanded into a community of metaverse builders including creators, developers, business operators, and Web3 investment and research personnel. We are dedicated to cultivating web3 newbies, and helping newbies understand blockchain technology, Web3 environment and opportunities for creators. We will lead them to complete the migration and adaptation to Web3.


## Roadmap and milestones

We will post new subtitled content at least once a week on multiple Chinese platforms (WeChat, bilibili, and Red). If there is an event in Decentraland, we can produce more. We will post weekly events and news about Decentraland in Chinese on WeChat groups. We are also gonna spend some grants to teach people that want to become creators using professional programs and knowledge.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

This proposal seeks a grant to purchase a plot of decentralized land on which to build a learning facility (""METAcademy"") for seekers of knowledge, mentoring, and socialization with others. METAcademy would be a site for learners and educators to interact with knowledge together by sharing online classrooms about any topic imaginable. Additionally, this space would function as a study environment and safe, social zone for intellectuals. As an educator with nearly a decade of experience teaching online and in traditional buildings, it is apparent that education should take the next step toward integrating with technology to provide learners the optimal setting for educating. Learn from the comfort of your computer and be part of the future!


## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x915Aa85DC088ea2d5850d44f9A21c7BF388A9672

## Description

Access to knowledge should be a right--not a privilege. From the most remote corners of the word to new online societies, a main objective should be to spread knowledge and promote learning. Information should not be limited by language, location, or liquidity but rather compared, contrasted, and critiqued. In an era when information is at the tip of a finger, education must shift to a focus on verifying information, processing knowledge, and applying techniques to our lives. METAcademy would be a base for a variety of courses and classes for learners to pursue. From physical fitness and cooking to traditional English and mathematics, this new realm of education would offer learners revolutionized access to topics and concepts. Learners may enter METAcademy and select from a running list of subjects--some of which may take place on Jupiter or in ancient China. Let Shakespeare talk about his time or learn the Pythagorean Theorem from Pythagorus himself. Work completed within the METAcademy may be minted as NFTs for collectibles within Decentraland, with duplicates donated to the learning facility collections. Learners may utilize ""rooms"" within the METAcademy to study alone or with peers and participate in discussions. Enter the next generation of education and learn something new today!


## Specification

To obtain the name ""METAcademy"" within decentraland, it would cost .007328 ETH. Also, the cheapest parcel of land currently listed for sale is located at -56, -133 for 3,450 ETH.  Alternatively, this design may work with other, more fiscal hosting options. A GoFundMe has also been created to promote donations from intellectuals hoping to secure a location for safe and limitless learning: https://gofund.me/d300c2e2 . This location would act as a host for the different classes offered by teacher users. Learners could assemble and select a class and teacher within the server to be relocated for sessions. Educators may utilize their Avatars to interact with students within Decentraland, list zoom links for online class learning, or use Google systems for materials, links, and videos. Several starter NFTs have already been minted for interaction including the building and emotes: 0xee8f3df7e0a66f2943133eb43dd29b354df060f9
Contracts for educators would include sections which agree to refrain from certain interactions and content. Educators would be independent contractors responsible for the materials, instruction, and feedback for learners.


## Personnel

I'm TeacherBr00ke (Brooke Cadieu) and I proposed this learning facility after discovering the new society of online users looking to shape the future. I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a degree in English education for grades 6-12. I received my teaching license from the state of Tennessee and educated in public schools in Chattanooga for several years. Within the brick-and-mortar classroom, I fostered relationships with students and experienced the difficulty of educating large groups of students in real time. Specifically, intrusions of personal space and bullying were common detractions from everyday learning. Further, I noticed a need for specified learning for students with varying interests and skills. This meant that the traditional path and curriculum was not benefitting every student equally. Thus, I realized that learning should be more flexible and interest-driven.

I later switched my educating to online courses offered to students located in China. In these classrooms, students ages 3-15 would log on with a camera and microphone to learn English. With nearly a thousand students and over one-hundred thousand minutes taught online, I learned that every, single student has different needs. Samples of my online teaching can be viewed on Teacher Brooke YouTube. However, regulations in China prohibited the connection of servers from outside Mainland China to continue and I could no longer teach my students in this region.


## Roadmap and milestones

Beginning phases should be expected to take approximately three months to procure a location, mint features and emotes, enlist educators, enroll students, and advertise beginning courses. Within the first month, a location for the facility would purchased and design for its interior and grounds would begin. Also, infrastructure for learning environments would be established. By month two, advertisement for educators would begin with applications and contracts submitted for proposed learning topics. Contracts would be signed before educators could submit a course for review. Proposed courses would be reviewed before listed in the curriculum. Advertisements for student sign-ups would begin. By month three, preliminary courses would be offered within Decentraland for students. Over the remaining start-up time, additional courses and educators would be made available and feedback would refine courses for learners. Once the program is fully sufficient, works created within METAcademy will be featured in a collection for viewing, collecting, and showcasing the learning done within METAcademy.

Should DCL create an addition to the marketplace where we can sell assets and builder scenes via NFTs with downloadable .glb/.zip files?

In the Decentraland we already have a ghost market for scene files and asset files.

Therefore, it would be better long term for DCL to build out a marketplace for these types of assets so that builders and creators can pay to list - then sell editions similar to wearables. They decide if its unique, mythic, rare, etc. We see this market in DCL competitors like Cryptovoxels already.

I have purchased sculptures for my voxel museum but I have to find and request artist or creators to make .glb files that are not NFTs to put in my DCL scenes. This type of market could open up DCL to a new world of creation. New trees, cars, buildings, walls, the whole game would enter a boom of development if we give creators the place to showcase their talents.

Great opportunity for sculpture artists, architects, and anyone who knows blender.

- No we should continue to sell via ghost market.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Mover is the easiest way for web3 natives to spend their assets offline and online. We have built a crypto debit card that can be topped up from a non-custodial wallet of your choice with a token of your choice.

We are already working with amazing DAOs and projects to let their users easily access their tokens offline. To name a few: Sushi, OlympusDAO, Redacted Cartel, Alchemix, Concave, Moralis, EPNS, and many more. Many other projects are already waiting for the integration!

Integrating Decentraland would mean that every MANA user will be able to natively (as connect - a wallet, sign a transaction, and magic happens) top up their Mover debit card using the Decentraland metaverse and MANA.


## Grant size

25,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xf6A0307cb6aA05D7C19d080A0DA9B14eAB1050b7

## Description

Our goal
Our goal is straightforward. We want to make sure that every Decentraland user can easily access their funds without the need to go to other networks or exchanges at any point in time.

We are self-funded and have been bootstrapping for over 1,5 years. We have received OlympusDAO and Gitcoin grants for gasless transactions. To offer new features to new users we need your support.

Benefits
• Our integration requires us to integrate a swap aggregator mesh: to be able to use MANA . It means that all DEXs will directly benefit from this option.
• Our integration also requires access to bridges: to be able to bridge funds for settlement. It means that Decentraland bridge will also directly benefit from the activity on the bridges.
• Finally, all DAOs, social projects, and new protocols will also benefit as their tokens (locked, vested, and other liquid assets) will also become available for the top-up.
• This integration benefits the MANA ecosystem by introducing a new level of utility for all MANA-based assets.

Flexible and Extendable
• We have a very modular platform, that will allow other projects on Decentraland to access our infrastructure and build their on card solutions on top of ours.


## Specification

The most important single aspect to mention is that our solution is already live.

Some additional information

https://github.com/Sinu5oid
https://github.com/bog5651
https://github.com/buba-developer


## Roadmap and milestones

Development Roadmap
To make MANA available as card top-up options, we are asking for a $25,000 grant. The grant will include building and open-license/open-source the following elements:
• Mover Central Transfer Proxy - a generalised proxy contract that manages the logic of a swap, bridge and transaction settlement (Update of the contract)
• Mover Swap mesh exchange contract - a contract that manages token swap (Update of the contract)
• Mover bridge mesh contract - a contract that initiates a non-custodial bridge from a contract to contract (Update of the contract)
• Mover card top-up logic/contract - settlement flow (Update of the contract)

Metrics for success
We believe that the success of our integration can be measured with the following metrics:

1.  Total volume (of cash-in and cash-out options). This metric speaks for itself: the higher the volume, the more the network assets are used.
2.  Total transactions (every top-up requires at least one swap and a bridge transaction). It affects network usage.
3.  Number of new projects on the network with Mover integration. This metric affects ecosystem growth.

15594,15594,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Curation of Programmatic Collections for Linked Wearables,"> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)

### Summary

Define the curation process of Programmatic Collections for Linked Wearables a.k.a [Third Party Wearables](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240).

### Abstract

This is a [follow up proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) to cover one particular use case around Linked Wearables collections that are created in a programmatic way. This means that each item was not crafted individually by hand, but automatically generated with code, many times from traits that were previously designed and modeled. [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks), [CryptoAvatars](https://opensea.io/collection/averagepunks-) and [BAYC](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) are examples of Programmatic Collections.

### Motivation

It is very unpractical, and almost impossible, to curate all the wearables in a large collection of 10k items, or more. It is also prohibitively expensive for third parties. But if that collection was made programmatically, it may not be necessary to curate every item one by one. It would make much more sense to audit the **process** used to generate that collection and curate a **random portion** of the items. Like when you are boiling spaghetti, you don’t need to try them all to know when it’s ready ;)

### Specification

This is a proposal to introduce a new and more efficient way to curate this particular case of collections for Linked Wearables. It will make it easier and faster for the curator, shorten the time to put the collection in production, and save costs for the third parties.

The new mechanic consists of 2 parts:

1.  **Reviewing the method:** the curator will review the programmatic method used to create the items in the collection. If the method proves to be generating items programatically with the same base traits, it will follow up with the second step.
2.  **Reviewing items in the collection:** as the items were not created individually - but automatically with a previously validated programmatic method - there is no need to review each item in the collection. Reviewing just a random portion of the items will be enough to validate the rest. The curator will randomly choose X% items in the collection and curate only those. X% to be defined in this proposal.

### Voting

Vote to define “X”, meaning the portion of the collection to be curated to consider it approved as a whole.

1.  **YES: X = 1%**
2.  **YES: X = 0.5%**
3.  **YES: X = 0.25%**
4.  **YES: X = 0.1%**
5.  **NO:** Decline this curation method for programmatic collections in Linked Wearables

### Examples

*   **“x” = 1%:** If 1% of the items in the collection have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 100 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 100 wearables\*
*   **“x” = 0.5%:** If 0.5% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 50 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 50 wearables\*
*   **“x” = 0.25%:** If 0.25% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 3k items, then 8 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 8 wearables\*
*   **“x” = 0.1%:** If 0.1% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 10 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10 wearables\*
*   **NO:** If the collection has 10k items and this curation method is not implemented, then 10k items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10k wearables\*

\*(USD 500 per wearable as defined in [the past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)).

Note: consider that, if a Third Party has to pay for *all* the items in a large collection, the price could be extremely restrictive for any Third Party. For example: at current curation prices, if the collection has 10k items, the price for the curation would be 5 million US dollars!

## Intellectual Property

The founders of this project are @Chibifabs, @MatSposta and @NFtSNiPeRbOt on twitter.  Each of our profiles say co-founder in Chibilabs.  Happy to share whatever information is required.  Thank you


## Motivation

We have a strong community of NFT holders. ~3,300 unique holders across 4 collections.   All of our NFTs come with full IP ownership of 3d Models.  We token gate the .glb and .fbx files per each NFT via chibilabs.io.   Our community has enjoyed DCL and we have gained a gold star as a point of interest for our estate in DCL.  We have thrown multiple parties with 1000-2000 ppl online.    We have made a few wearables for DCL.  One Chibi Hoodie, One pair of Chibi Shoes.  We also added Chibi Ape #2 as a Skin accessory and dropped that all of our holders via Bizzle Wear.   Tonight we are uploading 4 more skins to the Wearable marketplace.  We'd love to explore linked wearables given that all of our traits have been made generatively in 3d art.

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Abstract
In 2021, the word “Metaverse” went viral. However, there are only a few people who actually have experienced “Metaverse” in Japan. So Us, Room Zero is going to build Decentraland’s first interactive “Metaverse” class where visitors get to enhance their understanding towards Crypto and Metaverse (Defi, NFTs, and etc).  This will help users to understand why Metaverse can be the next future where people get to interact in a more secure and transparent society.


## Grant size

98,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x4A68a46859329a14AcF56B66EE45721795769E2b

## Description

Room Zero was founded in 2017 to deepen our understanding towards the next wave, web3. Our team has been working on developing a variety of platforms such as “Cheese” which is a platform where users receive a bitcoin in exchange for leaving a review for public products. This platform already has almost 100,000 active users just in Japan and is planning to spread even more.

The reason why we started our development in web 3 is because we clearly felt the need for transparency that is lacking in today’s society. Additionally, the enthusiasm which this web3 community has is insane! So we decided to come up with a plan to we can spread the knowledge of web 3 technologies on decentraland even to people who do not know what “blockchain” is.

This will help new entering-users to comprehend the potentials which Metaverse has, which will revitalize our community and tokens faster and bigger. Since we concluded that the people are not as excited as the peak time is because the structure of Metaverse (even just in crypto) is too complicated that people didn’t really understand the value and potentials of Metaverse. Thus we believe that this will help our new users to comprehend what Metaverse is.


## Specification

Specification
To make the users more involved in our platform, the layout and the design of its building has to look fun and attractive. We’re not going to build a library where users get to just walk around and read textbooks. That’s just too boring. But rather, we’re going to build a dreamland where visitors get to experience and learn about web 3. For instance, we’re under development of building a maze where people have to choose the right answer for them to make it to the goal.
Also, we’re planning to build an escape room and roller coaster where users can experience and learn about structures of P2E and DAO.

List of things where this land will provide
・Learning about the structure of Metaverse
・Structure of Crypto/Blockchain and its potential
・What is NFT?
・Defi
・Metaverse new idea box

Also, using DAO, we’re planning to distribute tokens where investors get to govern the service of its development.

The allocation of investment will be
・$3,000 : For hiring an Architect Designer
・$2,000：DAO Development
・$4,800 : Land Creator
\*We also have several creators in our team (not included in a grant).

Image:file:///C:/Users/info/Downloads/dao.PNG
\*This is our test-play screen of the maze.. We cannot show you what the actual buildings will look like yet since it’s under development.


## Personnel

We already have multiple investors and a VC who is willing to invest for us to make a land purchase. Our budget for the land is approximately $200K so far, so we’re going to have fairly big lands where users can interact and learn about the structure of Crypto and Metaverse.


## Roadmap and milestones

・Final design decided (August)
・Creating lands (September-January)
・In Public (Feburary) →Improvements

This is our first grant report so feel free to leave any feedback or comments.
English is not our first language so I apologize if there’s any part where our description is unclear. But we know this plan is going to help not only Decentraland community but also web3 industry as a whole, so please help us receive our grant!
Thank you.

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

I have a YouTube channel where I make videos ranging from Metaverse game tutorials to Decentraland walkthroughs. The main purpose of my channel is to create content to help people become more familiar and comfortable with the DCL as they begin their journey in the Metaverse. I also made a Brazilian community on Discord where everyone helps each other at events.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x9E097E32E992eA7A66DB4C01C8a142e3ABCd119A

## Description

On my channel I produce videos where the community itself suggests content. I have almost 1000 subscribers and videos with 31,346 views. I have 500 members on discord, where we exchange ideas, ask questions and help each other a lot to have a united and strong community within Decentraland to have fun and make the most of each event.


## Specification

If the grant is approved, I can commit to making at least 3 videos every week, focused on more content to help the community.

Youtube channel link:
https://www.youtube.com/c/annagamermetaverso/videos

Discord link:
https://discord.gg/evdnXmCBAP


## Personnel

My name is Anna Gamer and I create my videos by myself. I started making videos on YT in October 2021. I'm from Brazil and when I started the channel there was little content about Decentraland in the Portuguese language and that's why I decided to make videos for the Brazilian community. I always keep an eye out for updates and news to contribute to the community. I was the first Brazilian to make tutorial videos of the Decentraland metaverse. I want to continue creating relevant content, as Brazilians have taken up a great deal of the metaverse and I believe that my content can contribute to helping the Portuguese language community at Decentraland to develop.

Should the name Impossible be added to the Denied Names list, banning it from Decentraland?

## Description

The word “Impossible” shall not exist in Decentraland, merely this word is offensive to the foundation of MVR

15602,15602,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Percentage based VP,"> by 0x07356b0edf9b934330f41952b09d076c3810c608 (Bet)

Currently the circulating MANA supply is 1.3b VP

The LAND supply is 90,000 \* 2,000VP = 180m VP
(minus roads, districts and plazas)

NAME supply is 31,000 = 3.1m VP

Wearables = 0 VP

My proposal is that we transition to a percentage based system to calculate VP.

|  MANA |  49% |
|---|---|
| LAND   |  49% |
| NAMES   |  1% |
|  WEARABLES  | 1%  |

Example of a vote:

| ITEM  | % | YES | % | NO |
|---|---|---|
|MANA  |  42%  | 600,000 mana vote yes  |    7% |100,000 mana vote no |
|LAND   |  9.8% | 20 land vote yes |  39.2%  | 80 land vote no  |
|NAME   | 0.1%  | 10 names vote yes  |  0.9% |  90 names vote no |
|WEAR   |  0.5% | 0 wearables vote yes |    0.5% | 0 wearables vote no |
| Result  |  52.4% | YES   |47.6%  | NO  |

Yes would win in this example.

There would still be a minimum MANA VP for grants.

Why change it?
There are a lot of institutions that have full custody of their customers MANA that could vote on proposals against our communities interest. Similar to how steem was hijacked by tron. https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/02/why-crypto-should-care-about-justin-suns-steem-drama/ .
I believe this proposal would make it more fair for the users. Suggestions in the forum.

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

ADVERTSISING SPACE FACILITY (AD BOOSTER) - Purchase Advertising Space on the wearable marketplace to spotlight a published item for a selective period of time. In addition, sellers will be able to see what their forecasted reach would be from their chosen budget. Plus, sellers will receive demand analytics for advertising results.

LOYALTY POINTS PROGRAMME (LLP) -  to reward users for spending MANA, gaining points which can be redeemed or offset to future transactions.

Our mission is to further encourage the community to reinvest contributing to growth in the Decentraland economy.

Partnered with RAFT who have been operating for 10+ years, taking on over 600+ projects and well-adapt to the ETH blockchain.

## Description

Providing Advertising Space Facilities and Loyalty Points schemes are proven to  encourage engagement in marketplaces, social platforms and-all.

AD Boosters will discover items in a high supply economy boosting high and low exposure items:

*FACT* - According to ‘OnlineSales.ai’, “Introducing merchant-funded product listing ads can give a boost (to the Bottomline of the marketplace) of more than 50% of the revenue generated through GMV (Gross Merchandise Value). It significantly strengthens the revenue model of a marketplace.”

Loyalty Programme:

*FACT* :-

*   According to FORBES “78% of consumers are more likely to buy from a brand with a loyalty program”
*   According to FinExtra “71% of consumers say loyalty rewards programs are a meaningful part of their brand relationship”

Selling wearables – Noticeably, there is a large supply of wearables entering the marketplace daily which gives sellers less time on the ‘Newest Items’ list and at the top of the page of the item category.

The grant provided will fund version 1.0 which will be the initial instalment to AD BOOSTER & LLP. We anticipate that there will be further updates & added features required post the project going LIVE from internal & external sources. Internally, being analysing user activity and externally, being user feedback.

## Abstract

Developing a Metaverse Theatres are popular places for community members and friends to watch movies together. Most individuals are unable to travel owing to a lack of funds and time, but with the assistance of the metaverse, consumers may experience travel, nature, and nearly anything that we would encounter in real life. Office meeting places, similar to Zoom and Google Meet, but in a virtual world using holograms. I work with a team of full stack developers that have over 5 years of expertise creating NFT markets and AR. We are non-profit researchers who wish to contribute to Metaverse by making our technology open source so that anybody may learn, create, and contribute.

## Description

As a blockchain startup and metaverse enthusiasts we seek to help younger and upcoming generation to learn and build there skills with blockchain developer. Most of the people are not able to travel due to lack of wealth and time but with the help of metaverse customers can experience travel, Nature and almost everything that we would experience in real time can be experienced and the beauty is that even differently able people could experience the travel. NFT's and other metaverse wearable goods can be bought inside the market place and we can implement amazon like shops like super market where every product can be seen, viewed and reviewed. We can directly order inside the metaverse and can get products in door steps in reality.Virtual weddings are currently going on trend as guest and everything from food to rent place is reduced and is cost effective yet wonderful experience. As education and competitions gets harder and harder student lack in the skills and practical knowledge with help of VR education students can learn parts of machinery and also helps for doctors to learn about human anatomy. Movie theatrical experience in the comfort of home within a VR space and can spend time with loved once and get experience of Real-time theatre experience. We also create an metaverse casino space as a P2E gaming. Companies in the entertainment industry are capitalising on the notion of metaverse hospitality by producing realistic experiences that clients can enjoy from the comfort of their own homes, largely via the use of virtual reality technology and VR headsets. In reality, this is an exceptionally cost-effective approach. Roller-coasters, are expensive to build in real life, and there are severe safety regulations. However, with a virtual reality experience, genuine roller coasters may be enjoyed in a virtual environment without the prices or risks. Of course, virtual reality experiences can violate natural rules, and some of the other possibilities include virtual experiences such as walking on the moon or Mars, or visiting virtual tourist spots.


## Specification

With the help of Unity 3D, Java.AR and 3D modellings with blender and publish directly with decentraland as sublayers and transactions will be processed with decentraland.
With solidity and blockchain as back end we run all the process and run them under smart-contracts.
Our plan is to have a space where other projects and brands can relate and join, which will bring more users. Creating more customers for decentraland with game features will bring more value to Decentraland. There are many people interested in travelling and we believe this project can expand quickly.

Once we have the HQ running we can generate income by:

Renting space for offices and other merch,
Custom events for clients(marriages etc)
Creating learning courses inside decentraland
Selling courses as NFTs
The funds from DAO would allow us to create improved and sustainble experiences that we can later present to users, clients and collaborators. We plan to work with iconic creators, invest on promoting and bringing more people in, by building a platform with a fun game-play and dynamic supportive enviroment.

## Summary

Add district names to decentraland map


## Abstract

Identify the distrincts in the decentraland map


## Motivation

Since I entered decentraland for the first time, and today in my day to day life, I see these huge masses of blue land and I never know which district is which.

I see no point in not having your name on the map!


## Specification

The dao should add the district names in a different style than the point of interest.


## Conclusion

Add district names to decentraland map to identify them.

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Vueltta is an international art collective creating immersive experiences in Decentraland. We will present our new Decentraland project ‘The Labyrinth Effect’ to a major audience of global artists and brands at NFT Show Europe.

The Labyrinth Effect is currently self-funded and will happen with or without this grant. But, as independent artists and designers, we’d greatly appreciate DAO support towards build and exhibition costs. The Labyrinth Effect will be an important demonstration of Decentraland’s creative potential to an audience of leading digital artists, brands and investors.

## Description

**‘The Labyrinth Effect’** is a new series of immersive Decentraland installations and events by art collective [Vueltta](https://vueltta.com/). Visitors are invited to explore ‘The Tower Labyrinth’ and ‘The Pyramid Labyrinth’, two large-scale installations across two Decentraland locations. Inside each labyrinth, visitors will experience contemporary art in an entirely new way.

First coined by researcher Dr. John Rhodes in 2006, ‘The Labyrinth Effect’ describes the states of mind evoked by walking a labyrinth. According to Rhodes, labyrinths create liminal spaces which promote ‘flashes of intuition, insight and openness’.

**Vueltta’s labyrinths seek to bring this liminal experience into the metaverse.**

*‘Labyrinths are an ancient archetype dating back 4,000 years or more.  They evoke metaphor, sacred geometry, spiritual pilgrimage… and community building’*
— The Labyrinth Society

**Motivation 1: DCL Beyond 'NFTs in Frames'**

As an art collective, Vueltta’s aim is to use art installation and interactive technologies to explore how shared virtual experience will shape society and identity. As artists, we’re committed to using Decentraland to find new dimensions for contemporary art.

We believe creative teams like ours can go far beyond ‘NFTs in frames’ to provide immersive experiences - engaging new audiences both with art and with Decentraland. These ‘non-gaming’ experiences have significance for brands, artists and creative agencies evaluating their entry into the metaverse.

**Motivation 2: Engage a wider creative community with DCL**

The Labyrinth Effect will be presented at [NFT Show Europe](https://nftshoweurope.com/) to some of the most important digital artists working today. These include [Zancan](https://twitter.com/zancan), [Kim Asendorf](https://twitter.com/kimasendorf), [AL Crego](https://twitter.com/ALCrego\_), [VNCCII](https://twitter.com/VNCCII_OFFICIAL), [Loackme](https://twitter.com/loackme\_) and [Tim Maxwell](https://twitter.com/maxwellinked). It will also be seen by Hide Uehara, Director of business development for [Square Enix](https://twitter.com/SquareEnix), the Japanese conglomerate behind [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy), as well as brands like [EssilorLuxottica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EssilorLuxottica).

The conference organisers expect at least 900 visitors. The Labyrinth Effect will be live-streamed into the exhibition hall of the event, where Vueltta artists will demonstrate the project and assist new users. We are also confirmed to present the project on a main conference stage.

To engage the NFT Europe Show audience further we plan several live events over the show dates. These will also be publicised on DCL discords and open to all:

*   Guided Labyrinth Walks with Vueltta Artists
*   Labyrinth Flash Mobs

Video and photography from these events will be shared across social media. The team's previous events gained 250+ visitors/week through social media promotion alone. We expect visitor data to be much higher when combined with our NFT Show Europe presence, and will report all figures back to the DAO.

Film and photography from The Labyrinth Effect will be used in presentations for future creative industry summits.


## Specification

The Labyrinth Effect will be designed and built by Vueltta, then deployed by our land collaborators.

We have already confirmed our collaborations for the two build locations:

**Indie Village - location for The Tower Labyrinth**

Land collaboration by [Bill Burns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-burns-86505059/), gallery build by [KJ Walker](https://www.lowpolymodelsworld.com/)

[Indie Village](https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I4zft\&position=100%2C30\&realm=dg) is a 20-acre master-planned virtual development that aims to become the premier cultural destination of the metaverse.  Partnered with NIVA (National Independent Venue Association), Indie Village brings real-world venues to life in Decentraland - beginning with a series of benefit shows in late summer 2022. Indie Village will be activated on a nightly basis with live concerts, art galleries, comedy clubs, fashion shows, social clubs and numerous other immersive virtual experiences.  With a special mission to support women and the arts, Indie Village is currently hosting ‘Infinite Objects presents Women of the World’, an exhibition showcasing the art of 130 female artists from all over the globe.

**Edifice Metaversal - location for The Pyramid Labyrinth**

Land collaboration by [G.S. Broz](https://discordapp.com/users/371757849530859522/) and [metaplazas.com](https://metaplazas.com/), supported by [Dax](https://discordapp.com/users/394244378291470336/)

[Edifice Metaversal](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=2%2C-39) is a 43 parcel estate created by NFT photobook pioneer G.S. Broz and Berlin-based design studio metaplazas.com. It was recently awarded a runner-up prize for architecture in Renovi’s Next Top Metaverse Build and was featured on Polygonal Mind’s MetaTrip #40. Inspired by IRL superstructures like Berlin’s ICC and Singapore’s PARKROYAL on Pickering, the estate is proud to be home to the metaverse’s first paternoster lift.

Now moving beyond the initial build, Edifice Metaversal aims to become a noteworthy hub of digital culture. The team is currently cultivating partnerships with tech-savvy art collectives like Vueltta in order to curate the best in boundary pushing SDK-based art. The Pyramid Labyrinth will be installed on the estate’s sweeping seventh floor roof terrace. [ \[2, -39\]  ](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=2%2C-39)

Hello community and Happy New year!

Hear me out, there are a lot of games inside DCL atm that are not supported properly, you cannot contact their owners for support properly and it feels like they are being put there just to fill up space.

I dont want to get into specifics  about who, when and why (that is an opinion and an observation mostly) but i do think that whoever puts stuff into DCL should get some sort of a Quality Control.

I love the idea behind the review committee on the wearables to maintain control on quality and quantity.

\*PS I do get the point that anyone can do whatever they want with their land but if we indeed want to maintain a high level of quality with wearables, shouldn't that go for in-world interaction scenes,games etc?

Thank you for your time!

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

A financial model is the foundation for which TradFi companies make decisions around revenue,  expenses, partnerships, M\&A, etc. We believe that Decentraland would benefit greatly from having a financial model that they could reference when making  operating decisions. The financial model would include historical financial statements, a monthly budget for 2022, and a detailed forecast out through 2025.

As a first step, we would propose preparing financial statements for January – May of 2022, and a strawman for what a 2022 budget and long-range forecast would be. We would share our report with the community, and to the extent they were interested, we would propose a new grant to develop a fully-detailed and dynamic financial model.


## Grant size

20,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x11cbB078596E5100F4cbB999c5C9b69cA2FF6477

## Description

As DAOs mature, we expect to see more sophisticated financial frameworks emerge in the operations of DAOs.

The three pieces of this are historical financial statements, a near-term budget, and a long-term forecast. These are three things that TradFi companies have entire teams dedicated to building and maintaining. They form the basis for key operating decisions that companies make around revenue, expenses, cash management, etc. and also serve as a helpful launch point when making key strategic decisions around partnerships, fundraising, and M\&A.

MakerDAO is a DAO that has detailed financial reporting in place and they use it inform a variety of these operating decisions: https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/14U-3xlXC59zmFCd2u42CAFc7uw-NSKaJ/view

Putting together these three things is a material undertaking, so we would propose as a starting point to put together monthly financial statements for January - May of 2022, and a strawman of a short-term budget and a long-term financial forecast. Upon completing that, we would share our report with the DAOs, and would then propose a subsequent grant to build out all years of historical financial statements, in addition to a detailed budget and long-range forecast.

The financial statements and forecast would sit in google sheets, but ultimately we would drive towards having a presentation with visuals so that the community would be able to get monthly / quarterly reports on financial performance and the implications on the long-term financial forecast for Decentraland.

Currently, Jordan and I are charging $500 / hour to do similar FP\&A work for web2 companies. Even the initial step of this exercise is a material undertaking, and for $20k,  our hourly rate will come out out well below that. We are proposing this initial step because we believe strongly that once the community sees an initial output, they will see the value in what we are doing and be supportive of further grant work for Jordan and I to continue supporting the Decentraland community.

Ultimately, we want to drive towards having a sophisticated FP\&A function for Decentraland, and this grant is the first step we would take towards getting there.


## Specification

The initial report would be presented in google slides, with the underlying analysis being done in google sheets. The main tools we would leverage to retrieve data would be Etherscan, Apeboard, and Dune.


## Personnel

Sam Bronstein: 7 years of investment banking experience at Qatalyst. Worked on $125Bn+ of M\&A transactions including the sales of Slack, LinkedIn, Qualtrics, Glassdor, and others.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-bronstein-683b1350/

Jordan Stasnty: 7 years of investment banking experience at Qatalyst and Citi. Worked on $35Bn+ of M\&A transactions including the sales of Mailchimp, Five9, Salesloft, and others. Also worked on the IPO of Roku at Citi.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-stastny-78160461/

All of the above transactions included material amounts of financial modeling and analysis during the valuation and diligence process.


## Roadmap and milestones

We would propose sharing our 2022 historical financials and strawman for the budget and forecast no later than 4 weeks after being approved for the grant, with the aim of finishing sooner

say you're in the virtual world of Decentraland and you run across someone that has their top 5 or 3 main interest listed next to their name and can be changed periodically.. something so simple as "" Someone to talk to "" promoting mental health, or ""First person shooter"" .. allows us to interact with someone easier.. "" what first person shooters you play?"".. ""you need someone to talk to? whats going on?"" ... if there is an event you're attending that day, show it off in your avatar and see if theres anyone else attending the same event. So many ways to interact in an easier way.. I truly believe this idea has major upside and potential. From brands to really anything at all. endless probabilities.

## Description

In february 2022, our community approved a Decentraland DAO [grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8219300-900f-11ec-9794-c9ea21a9ed8f) that enabled us to create, update and make freely available to the community a [top-down view map of genesis city](https://genesis.city/). You can read the grant proposal [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8219300-900f-11ec-9794-c9ea21a9ed8f).

Back then, a prototype version existed, but the mapping script was buggy, the map hadn’t been updated in a while, and the site was very basic and not very performant.
Since getting the first grant, we’ve updated the map monthly. We’ve also worked on improving the mapping script in order to reduce the human interventions needed to complete a full map and we’ve greatly reduced the time needed for the script to run. We’re now confident we can provide weekly (instead of monthly) updates. We’ve also added a “Jump in” button that allows the user to jump into the scene at the right-clicked coordinates.

We received a great deal of feedback and requests to develop new features.
This grant will set up a budget, including salaries and expenses (web hosting, image storage, and domain name renewal, for now), to run this team for the next 6 months of developments and updates. Further grants will be requested by us in the future if the community continues to be happy with our work.


## Specification

A working version can be found on https://genesis.city/

Site code: https://github.com/maraoz/genesis.city/

We’re using GitHub to host the images, and Netlify to handle deployments and building the website.


## Personnel

*   **maraoz** - original map prototype creator, will oversee that the project’s vision is aligned with the Decentraland community (Product Owner Role). Will also act as Project Manager until a replacement is found and hired.
    https://github.com/maraoz
*   **Rodrigo Heredia** - Full Stack Unity3d + Web Developer https://github.com/rheredia-dev
*   **Project Manager**: to be hired. Making interviews now with 3 candidates.

Budget: $6,050 USD per month, resulting in $36,300 USD grant total.
This monthly budget includes:

*   Team compensation : $6,024/month

## Roadmap and milestones

An updated version of the map will be live weekly.  We'll also create an NFT on Rarible with the full map once per month. The map’s content will be updated via script every week for 6 months.  Once that time has elapsed we will request another grant in order to provide further maintenance and updates. Other than that, these are the things we’ll  be working on (we also want to be flexible to adopt future community feedback, so don’t take this as set in stone).

**June 2022**: Automate zoom layer creation and optimize mapping script. Start running the mapping script weekly.\
**July 2022**: Resolve pending problematic tiles bugs and start work on new mapping script traversal algorithm (screenshot already loaded scenes before moving to next unexplored tile)\
**August 2022**: Show visually when a tile changed recently. Finish new mapping script traversal algorithm.\
**September 2022**: Add a first overlay layer to the map (options are: estate delimitations, go-to-marketplace for tiles on sale, show districts, points of interest, or colors by owners).\
**October 2022 and on**: Add more overlay layer(s) based on previous list or community feedback, or additional community feedback implementations.

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[NFT Mint Amount Options](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f78ecc00-ee39-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)

## Summary

Summary
Remove current minting rarity tier system and allow for all possible mint numbers up to 100,000.


## Abstract

Currently, when uploading wearables creators are locked into choosing rarity tiers that specify a fixed mint amount. This limits the ability to release collections that would benefit from a more nuanced number (i.e., 50, 2500, 1999). A workaround involves minting greater than needed then burning the excess. I aim to allow for a simplified process from the start.


## Motivation

Decentraland (DCL) is the only NFT marketplace that does not allow for custom minting amounts. Considering other platforms allow this flexibility, I feel DCL should also allow this basic feature. As a prolific publisher, I at times struggle to choose an appropriate rarity tier for my items. The most common tiers used, Legendary, Epic, and Rare, have mint amounts spread to far apart, 100, 1000, and 5000 respectively. Currently the rarity tiers are:

Unique: 1

Mythic: 10

Legendary: 100

Epic: 1000

Rare: 5000

Uncommon: 10,000

Common: 100,000

The two methods to circumvent this restrictive system are:

1.)	To create and burn excess mints.

2.)	Create your own contract and go through the Linked Wearables Registry.

There are a few issues with those. To create and burn causes undue burden for the creator and the network. Further, depending on how many are burned, invalidates the rarity color system. With Linked Wearables, this option is less-than-often applicable to the intent of the publisher. Linked wearables have no rarity designation and are not able to be sold or traded within DCL. They are simply DCL representations of External NFTs you may already own.
As you can see the current system leaves much to be desired.


## Specification

I propose removing the minting tiers system and to allow the publisher to specify any number of mints, up to a maximum of 100,000.  This will enable creators to choose custom mint amounts specific to their own needs, while also keeping a high maximum on possible mints.

Upon submitting a request to publish a wearable, the user will specify the maximum number of mints for the item instead of specifying a rarity tier.  Legacy values from the tier system can be used as suggested guidelines or defaults.\
The wearables submission page, rarity fields in the builder, and wearable smart contracts will be updated by the DCL development team in order to accommodate the new system.


## Conclusion

By enabling Creators and Publishers to have greater freedom of their collections through expanding the minting amount options, DCL will benefit from increased creativity and expression. This is a simple change to bring DCL to parity to other platforms and encourage continued user growth.

## NFT Collections Description

### The Diesel x neuno Alpha Drop

Diesel S.p.A. is an Italian retail clothing company, located in Breganze, Italy. It sells denim, and other clothing, footwear, and accessories.

Diesel Alpha is digital representation of [Diesel Prototype Sneakers](https://tinyurl.com/9un5p4pk) . It was dealt through free mint in June 2022. Holders of the NFT are going to be able to enjoy their Diesel Prototype Sneakers in DCL as linked wearable.

### neuCard

neuCard is the neuno membership card created by us. Holders of neuCard will have priority access to fashion drops organized and partnered with us. In the future linked wearables will be linked to the NFT making holders automatically be able to wear the wearables in DCL only by holding the neuCard.

## Motivation

Project neuno is a digital fashion company, which curates iconic fashion moments of the time through images, videos or art ready for collection. We work with fashion photographers, directors, stylist, artists, celebrities as well of course as our beloved brands.

We have recently made 2 NFT drops which both will have linked wearables: neuCard and Diesel x neuno alpha drop. Both NFTs will have linked wearables in DCL, starting from Diesel Prototype Sneakers, which will be our first linked wearable.

Earlier this year we also had 2 sets of wearable [drops](tinyurl.com/44xj7a8v) during Metaverse Fashion Week:

*   DF x Neuno where we dropped 6 digital wearables and 4 physical items during MFW
*   Giuseppe Zanotti digital wearable also at MFW

Should the following Tier 1: a one-time payment of $500 - $1500 USD in MANA grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

As much as grants can support creative development, I think we should also invest in making sure the world gets to see everything we do. There are many amazing content creators who I believe bring an important piece to our community and growing it, and hope you believe The Decentraland Report is one of them!

While working a full time job in technology, I've used any free time the last 6 months to grow The Decentraland Report. To reach more people, essentially marketing for DCL, I need to be able to afford video edits post more frequently. I've been working with an individual who has done great work so far and cares. To help The Decentraland Report grow, please help with this grant to cover video editing cost for 10 videos ($50/video).

## Description

Every Tuesday and Thursday, typically around 7pm EST, The Decentraland Report has been streaming on www.Twitch.TV/KevinOnEarth999. In such, we have grown to one of the biggest Decentraland Stream channels featuring segments like #NFTuesday.

This effort has been for the most part taken on by myself, however when it came to video editing I needed help if we were going to really make an impact and show the world what Decentraland is like.

Here are some different styles we have done:

Atari Launch Event Coverage:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUk2fWKBZ0I\&t=24s

The First Town Hall:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pktEjZGNvME\&t=6258s

TOP NO STOP:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBZVrBnxrNg


## Specification

I will continue to stream every Tuesday and Thursday, and in such, provide the video of my stream to the Video Editor who will put together these videos for multiple weekly releases.

This would most likely multiply the impact made when we do the Report and it would be able to reach many more people who can't be there at the specific time, or have limited time and want to watch a trimmed down version.


## Personnel

Host: Kevin On Earth https://twitter.com/kevinonearth999
Editor: @Stefan.Kime on Instagram


## Roadmap and milestones

This grant will cover 10 videos for us, in such taking us 5 weeks of content!

In speaking to the community, some people are questioning whether it makes sense to use DAO funding towards content creators, however, I believe it all depends what you want to grow in the community. I hope you will trust that The Decentraland Report does in fact bring value to this community, and that by giving us this opportunity to have more consistent video editing done, we will be attract more foot traffic and visitors.

What I propose is, instead of allowing any address to directly request the maximum Tier.
Require per address to first go, as maximum with Tier 3, once vesting contract is finished, then allow Tier 4 for the same submitter address, and so on.

This protects the funds of the DAO, also ensure the commitment of a team with Decentraland platform over time and also helps the teams to grow in a healthy way.

The DAO comittee can validate the proposals once passed, so there is no coding effort necessary in the DAO dapp from start, although of course they will save some time if the dApp already covers it.

I'm resubmitting because I was focusing on two coins when the point is to look for other alternatives.

Hello, community. I'm just doing this proposal to ask you what you think of the DAO owning +$1M in USDT. A crypto which is run by shady people and has been changing its narrative of how they pair to the dollar through the years.

I'm linking an article which will give you a better perspective of this coin: https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin

But there is a better video made by Coffeezilla which goes even deeper in regards to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg\&t

Please take in mind that this proposal it's not financial advice, but USDC (backed by Circle / Coinbase) and DAI seem better options. Even BUSD from Binance seems more legit.

The idea of the proposal is to know what you guys think but also to make sure the funds of the DAO are secure.

## Abstract

I have been working on a story since the early 1980s.  I used it as the background story of a virtual world game idea I embarked on in 2008.  I planned to use Mindark's Partner Planet Program for Entropia Universe.   I was not able to raise the investors and capital need to buy into a Planet Partnership.  At that time, it was $2M USD.  Since then, that price tag went up to $6M.

During that time, I recruited a volunteer team of designers and artists. Since we were unable to get funding, the project was shelved.  Recently, I started up again.  I successfully published the story, Children of Arla on Amazon.  My hope it to raise the funds this way.   I am also looking at Decentraland as a way to protoype the virtual world game.

## Description

Planet Postmoderna is my Design Studio and Virtual World platform.  As mentioned in the previous abstract:

I have been working on a story since the early 1980s.  I used it as the background story of a virtual world game idea I embarked on in 2008.  I planned to use Mindark's Partner Planet Program for Entropia Universe.   I was not able to raise the investors and capital need to buy into a Planet Partnership.  At that time, it was $2M USD.  Since then, that price tag went up to $6M.

During that time, I recruited a volunteer team of designers and artists. Since we were unable to get funding, the project was shelved.  Recently, I started up again.  I successfully published the story, Children of Arla on Amazon.  My hope it to raise the funds this way.   I am also looking at Decentraland as a way to protoype the virtual world game.

During the process from 2008 - 2014, the team fleshed out the concept, added to the base story, created art and models and built some prototype scenes in everything from Vastpark, Multiverse, CryEngine and now Unity.   Since I was never able to raise the capital we needed to solidify the contract with Mindark for the Partner Planet, I tried to build on my own in Unity.

I speant time learning C# of which, I barely am starting to understand, as well as polishing my skills at 3D design and Unity 3D.   You may learn more about the Postmoderna efforts on my website at http://www.planet-postmoderna.com and about the book as well.

I am hoping to rebuild a team to continue this project.  I need capital to do this.  I see Decentraland as a possibility for a prototype.  I am an advocate for virtual economies and currencies and have been intrigued by Blockchain applications.


## Specification

I have a full GDD that I am happy to share but might need an NDA to share it.  This has been my life's work and am uneasy to share specific details out of what is shown on my website.


## Personnel

Included in some of the presentations on my website.  Many team members have shown interest in coming back.


## Roadmap and milestones

Hello,
No I idea if I'm alone or if you think the same ?
In my opinion, Decentraland is not only for gaming (events, brands, music, etc).

When new people arriving (normal people not knowing Decentraland) to visit a event we create etc, they can select 'Play as guest'.

I would suggest to change the text to 'Visit as guest' or 'Join as guest' or 'Enter as guest'

It would fit more global events, because some people really don't arrive to play.

Tell me if you agree ? Thank you.

The new Skins category allows for full body outfits, which by default hides 4 wearable slots (Upper, Lower, Feet, Head).
The information given previously for creations combining these slots is that the limits of each could also be combined. So for these four slots, this would previously give a total of 6k tris, 8 materials and 8 textures.

Given the need to keep DCL running smoothly, 8 mats and textures would be an excessive load, but limiting to 5k tris is the bigger impact here. When you factor in hair and clothing on top of body parts that may still need to be showing, as well as back faces for undersides of clothing that are visible, being able to be freely creative is made difficult.

Leaving the limits as they are discourages people from using the new skins category and instead loading full body outfits into the upper slot and hiding the other slots as they have been doing already, so they can still use up to 6k tris.

Qwerty keyboards are not the only keyboards in the world.
A lot of person in the world use azerty, qwertz or custom keyboards.

During demonstrations a lot of foreign customers that are not familiar with IT are stuck in DCL because they cannot move correctly.

It would be great if DCL could support different keyboard's layout.

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

At ETHAnglia we are committed to developing a community to progress the understanding, adoption, utilisation and furthering of web3.

Over two events covering the MetaVerse, firstly, NorDevCon - the East of Englands biggest tech conference(17th June ) and our Gaming and the Metaverse event (21st June) event.

Our team have experience of organising, managing and running events, we are looking for support from Decentraland to create a bank of  heavily marketed (a banner above the bank of computers) terminals to ""dive in"", as well as support confirmed speakers to attend our events.

You can view our ETHAnglia events page here - https://ethanglia.org/events and see the NorDevCon landing page here https://www.nordevcon.com/


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x3D53800346707B7F0c7bA3b2cA0dA1b9e951dCd5

## Description

Our project is a community building project, allowing us to build the interest, understanding and adoption of Decentraland in the East of England and beyond. It will allow individuals to experience Decentraland for themselves, as well as hear talks on the project at our community events.

Through the funding, this will allow us to bring Decentraland ""live"" to an event with an estimated 500 developers in attendance, as well as another event with 100 individuls (of all walks of life). This will cover Decentraland as part of the ETHAnglia community of events, including venue hire, getting our confirmed speakers to attend including travel (including @ahoiMalloy) and having heavily marketed Decentraland terminals to experience the metaverse in person.

We appreciate that the communities will only utilise the ""terminals"" for events (we plan to integrate Metaverse into future events, but this is something we are still planning, we wanted to be explicit with our deliverables for this application). To further the technology utilisation, will ensure these are put to good use by being used by scholars of our web3 academy when not in use by the events (https://ethanglia.org/education)


## Specification

The project will fall into three major catagories:

Confirming Venues and Speakers

The venue for NorDevCon is already confirmed and a preliminary speaker list including a number of high profile speakers is in the works. We have a confirmed meetup date for Gaming and Metaverse venue on the 21st June, which will feature a streamed to YouTube ""fireside chat"" on Gaming and the Metaverse with speakers such as @AhoiMalloy.  We are able to support international speakers for the meetup (21st June) via Zoom for the fireside chat, but would love more in person speakers.

Preperation for Events

Event preperation is already underway due to the scale of NorDevCon. We have full use of the room used for the web3 track on the Friday and should we be succesful, this will include the Decentraland terminals, as well as live interviews for content creation.

During this phase, we would need to spec and purchase the computers for free use at the events on Decentraland. Decide what activities, if any, we promote to engage within the Metaverse. Create banners to sit above the Decentraland area promoting what is happening. In previous years at NorDevCon, high score events on driving simulators have gained huge traction. We would love similar to occur for the Decentraland, with MANA being a prize.

For the 21st July event, we will need to source a venue (in discussions for ITFC in Ipswich), arrange food and drinks, arrange ticketing (both Meetup and via Unlock Protocol).

Delivery

Sounds simple, but the delivery portion will make sure that members of the team are manning, organising and reviewing the use of the areas and making sure the maximum number of people are getting a good overview and use of the computers. Managing speakers, ensuring that tech is working etc.

## Roadmap and milestones

Milestone 1: Now - March 11th - Confirming Venues and Speakers

Deliverables to the team will be venue confirmation, invoice production for event venue and arrange travel for confirmed speakers for each event (we are looking to add to our lineup). This will include the topics to be covered and duration.

Milestone 2: March 11th - May 31st - Preperation for Events

Deliverables for this will be the outline of how the events will run as a document. This will demonstrate the use of the computers, what will be running (i.e. Decentraland event), how long each person will get to try out Decentraland.

We will through the phase agree internally the specifcation for the computers, as well as the marketing for Decentraland (we are currently thinking a wide banner to sit above the terminals). This will be agreed with Decentraland.

We will also outline the food and drink situation, have ticketing (free, but we do giveaways etc, and tickets are required) available and ready for the 21st, and update the community on its status.

Milestone 3: Delivery

Deliverables for this will be the events themselves, however, we will ensure that full visibility through our marketing (such as this video https://twitter.com/ETHAnglia/status/1492208434292404226?s=20\&t=VuyzReIaoYHbmx3skzAlBA) are pushed to show the excitement and outcomes of the events.

## Description

In Feb. 2022, Decentral Comedy took the Metaverse by storm with the world’s first ever Metaverse Comedy Festival, MIC DROP headlined by comedy superstar Gilbert Gottfried.\
Decentral Comedy’s motto is “In it For the Laughs” and we want to bring these experiences to users of Decentraland for free and our next big project:

INTRODUCING STREAM-X - 96 HOURS of continuous content, accompanied with other interactive experiences such as AMA's in Discord, Avatar ""Meet & Greets"", special NFT wearable and NFT giveaways and more!

Comics such as Andrew Schulz, Artie Lange, Dan Soder, Shane Gillis, Tyler Morrison and so many more!!

May 25th-28th, 2022

Decentral Comedy Club, the brand new ""DC podcast studio"", Decentral Games locations (casinos and more), any other partners that would love to be involved!

The Users in Decentraland will experience 96 continuous hours of comedy podcasts over the course of the 4 days.  This format is made to appeal to ALL DCL users around the world, being able to tune in at any point in the day for comedy content! Users will have access to special shows such as interactive experiences such as AMA's in Discord, Avatar ""Meet & Greets"", special NFT wearable and NFT giveaways plus more!\
STREAM - X will allow Decentral Comedy to introduce DCL as a platform to new comedians and be an opportunity to onboard top comedians into the space through a medium they are familiar with - podcasts.

Comedians are not known to be very tech savvy, so they too need a proven concept to see the potential. Our programming helps bridge the gap between what Zoom shows lacked in audience engagement but to onboard comedians to this platform they need to be shown that what we do isn't just your average Zoom show - it truly is an interactive production!
STREAM - X will create a resident podcast studio in our Decentral Comedy club for USERS to access and have an opportunity to use the space.  This will also be a space for comedians to use freely for future podcasts/events use once they fall in love with the DCL experience.
This festival will also serve as the launch pad for Decentral Comedy’s new original show/content combining comedy and the metaverse called Metaversus Mike, featuring one of the most poplar comics at the Mic Drop festival – MIKE WILMOT – shows images and feedback about MIKE.  This will be a Pilot project with 7 original episodes, the first of which debuting at the Stream-X Festival. (See attached document below)

To date Decentral Comedy has been a self-funded start-up wanting to prove to the users of Decentraland that WE ARE comedy in the Metaverse.  Delivering content at the highest level we are aiming to enhance the user experience to DCL through this new flagship Decentral Comedy project.

From supporting our grant application Decentraland users, landowners, mana holders and developers will see:
•	An amazing and fun experience for the community itself
•	Promotion and onboarding of new comics and through these comics, we will be able to tap into their massive engaged fanbases to generate new users
•	Development of our podcast studio
•	Development of pilot episode of Metaversus Mike
•	Development of onboarding tools such as video step by step guide
•	Website/Marketing/Promotion
•	The genesis of consistent comedy content regularly streaming into Decentraland

## Specification

The Decentral Comedy team will be utilizing our in real life relationships that we have built in the industry to onboard top tier talent with large, dedicated followings into the metaverse. We will be working with our video/audio production partners to create simple, easy to follow instructional material for talent to be able to participate not just in this event but in the future whether that be a simulcast of their content or in avatar form. Our aim is to bring influential people into the space so that they continue to develop within this new way connecting with comedy fans. We will be strategically onboarding talent who have a large heavily engaged fanbase that we can educated and convert into users. This talent also serves as the marketing due to their podcasts being major platforms. As we are very in tune with this part of the industry, we are confident that we can make it work two-fold not just in terms of getting big names into the space but having them become spokespeople for the project.

We will be employing experienced developers to create the space for the Stream-X events so that it is the optimal user experience for viewing/listening as well as interacting with festival talent. The studio space will then serve as a legacy space for the Decentral Comedy project to stream continuous content for users in Decentraland to enjoy and interact with. We will be working with DCL Connect to produce uninterrupted high-quality streams of the content that way users have the best possible entertainment without buffering and resolution issues.

We will be working with talent, writers, and productions teams to create customized original content for the festival and beyond that is relatable and fun for the Decentraland Community.

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Working with the Decentraland SDK allows to code complex behaviors, but developers are limited to using their code editor of choice when doing so and can't easily switch between coding and building with the Decentraland Builder. This is especially tedious when creating and placing new entities into the scene.
We are currently finalizing the development of a first stable version of DCL-Edit, a visual editor designed to work in parallel with the Decentraland SDK (see https://dcl-edit.com).


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D

## Description

DCL-Edit enables you to instantly switch between coding and designing your scene, just like it is the case with modern game engines like Unity. This, of course, can dramatically increase the speed at which you code and design your experience for Decentraland.

With DCL-Edit, you can place, transform, scale, and rotate entities just like in Unity and give them identifiers that you can instantly refer to in your code. A visual asset browser gives you a nice overview of the available assets and lets you easily pick and place one into your scene.

Feature Overview for this version

*   place, transform, scale, and rotate entities
*   add basic shape components
*   asset browser for GLTF Shapes
*   assign identifiers to entities
*   undo functionality
*   parenting of objects


## Specification

DCL-Edit is developed in Unity and will be downloadable as a npm package. It will be licensed under the MIT license. In its current state, the above features are already functional, but we need to put additional work into refactoring, testing and debugging to deliver a stable version.


## Personnel

We are developing this as representatives of the MetaGameHub DAO, a community that is heavily involved in the evolving Metaverse and Blockchain Space (check out https://www.metagamehub.io).

Specifically, we have 3 people working on this:

Jonathan Luebeck - Lead Programmer - years of experience in Unity

Michael Gantner - Programmer, Shader Programming - years of experience in Unity

Christian Werner - Project Lead - game developer and lecturer in Game Design

Towards the end, we will execute an extensive testing period with more people.


## Roadmap and milestones

The minimal requirements for a smooth workflow (see above feature lists) are already implemented, so in the next 3-4 weeks we will be working on a stable release version that everybody can seamlessly integrate into their workflow.

As a compensation for these last steps and as a sign of appreciation for the whole project, we kindly ask to receive a Tier 3 grant of $5.000 USD in $MANA.

In the future, DCL-Edit is planned to become a full-fledged editor for developing complex scenes with the Decentraland SDK. Coming features include

*   UI-Editor
*   Prefabs
*   Improved Asset Management
*   Improved Inspector
*   and many more …

Speaking for the MetaGameHub community, we are of course open to cooperate with the Decentraland community beyond just developing a tool.
We’d happily collaborate towards fostering decentralization within the Open Metaverse by marketing and educational measures, the development of MetaFi tools, and onboarding talented Web3 developers from connected universities.

## Description

Introduction:

To combat censorship in countries with little or no freedom of the press, Reporters without Borders released The Uncensored Library in Minecraft, which took the gaming world by storm.

Contained within this library are articles and books containing crucial information and reliable journalism published by reporters who face imprisonment, exile, or death. The purpose of The Uncensored Library is to deliver information to the public, avoiding suppression by governmental systems.

Already a globally renowned project which empowered over 25 million people; the recreation of the Uncensored Library’ in Decentraland is being seen as the next logical step in the project’s maturity. In making the Uncensored Library accessible in the metaverse, Reporters Without Borders will be able to actively lower the barriers to entry for censored citizens to access politically critical information, whilst further empowering censored journalists by widening their potential audience.

Information about the Project:

Since its creation, The Uncensored Library has reported a media reach of 2.7 Billion and has established itself as a grassroots movement that benefits citizens across the globe, all with a media budget of €0.

Overall, The Uncensored Library has reached more than 25 million gamers from 165 different countries, many of them suffering from censorship (including all target countries). As of 2021, the project had amassed over 17 years of accumulative playing time from individual players who spent countless hours inside the library reading politically censored books and articles by independent investigative journalists.

Why should we build this in Decentraland?

As outlined in Decentraland’s Code of Ethics, DCL strives to be a safe space for internet users, where all operations and transactions in Decentraland are rooted in a standard conduct of honesty, integrity, and openness, with a rigid desire to respect the human rights and interests of all involved parties in the space.

The Uncensored Library is a project which aims to fight against centralized authoritarian entities which actively disregard the rights, freedoms, and opinions of their citizens. The work done by Reporters Without Borders in the fight for truth and transparency in countries riddled by corruption and inequalities is admirable, and Web 3.0 can offer such organizations with new solutions in the fight against human rights violations.

One of the founding principles and solutions brought by Web 3.0 is the effective fight against corrupt, untransparent centralized authorities, and bringing the ‘digital home of press freedom’ to Decentraland is a smart way of signaling to the world that the Metaverse is so much more than just a place for celebrities to host concerts or for brands to sell NFTs.

## Specification

To begin this project, Metaverse Architects began bringing all the different stakeholders required to make this project a reality together. After extensive meetings, a way forward was agreed regarding how to branch this project into Decentraland, whilst securing a property of its deployment, and a means to replicate the experience in DCL.

One key part of this project is to ensure there is no expense on an NGO such as Reporters Without Borders, however, this grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what we stand for, whilst promoting our grant schemes with the large amount of Press that will catch up on this project.

Metaverse Architects shall be leading the bulk of the development, where we shall repurpose BlockWork's Minecraft design for it to work in Decentraland. This would require an ideation phase, where the build must be tweaked to work in DCL.

You can find the current Minecraft design here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBI7-pL52GY\&t=1s

Once the architecture is complete, another key part of the project, which would require some time to complete, is the migration of the entire digital collection of articles and books found in The Uncensored Library. Moreover, we would have to design a means to be able to access these articles and books in an easy-to-use and easy-to-read UI, which shall be another key part of the development.

Finally, the marketing stage of the project shall be coupled with deployment. This will be a crucial part of the project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes on Decentraland as possible with this build.

To do this, we will organize a launch event with Reporters Without Borders, which will have a multitude of different speakers on different topics, such as press freedom, cyber warfare, decentralization, and the overall impact of Web 3.0. This event will also bring a considerable amount of press awareness due to the partners involved. One key aspect of this event can also be the potential impact of DAOs on society, with the aim being to raise more awareness on the Decentraland DAO as a tech case study, highlighting how it decentralizes decision-making and empowers DCL users to fund projects and movements they believe in.

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[Should the DAO Committee be compensated?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3c9e7730-b9da-11ec-903a-6546e8793cef)

## Summary

Establish a monthly compensation for DAO Committee Members, who are currently acting as a trusted proxy to enact on-chain proposals voted in the DAO.


## Abstract

The main responsibilities of the DAO Committee are:

*   Moderate proposals in the governance platform (promote to enacted, passed, rejected)
*   Keep updated the list of POIs, BanNames and Catalysts.
*   Create and fund vesting contracts for paying grants.
*   Calculate and execute compensation for the Wearables Curation Committee.
*   Basic Treasury Management (release vesting, transfers to operational wallet, swap funds).
*   Reimburse gas fees to the DAO Committee.
*   Pay any other monthly compensation.

Some other tasks related to the role are:

*   Attend monthly Town Halls and provide general community support.
*   Give feedback to proposals, evaluate risks and implementations pathways.
*   Contact external organizations in the name of the DAO.

A short recap of some important proposals that required a DAO Committee’s hands-on intervention in order to enact them:

1.  Mar 2021 -  [Original proposal to migrate to a gas-less voting system.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/proposal-for-a-more-accessible-and-affordable-dao/450)

9.  Jan 2022 -  [Resignation of Eric from the DAO Committee.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705)


## Motivation

In the past year,  [one committee member has sent +500 transactions](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc)  in the name of the DAO. Thanks to  [the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) , this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. **However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and those efforts are not being compensated in any form**.
Adding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement who can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.

**Compensate DAO Committee members is fundamental for a sustainable DAO operation.**


## Specification

Establish a monthly payment of 2,400 USD payable in MANA each month. The amount is established in USD to avoid problems related to MANA's price volatility.

Each committee member will commit to working 10hrs per week at a rate of 60 USD/hr.


## Conclusion

Over the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. However this position has been voluntary for almost a year, and it requires substantial work from the members of the committee to cover their responsibilities.

Setting compensation for its members is key to attracting qualified candidates to join the committee and securing the timely operations of the DAO long-term.

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[Representing third-party NFTs as wearables in Decentraland](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)

## Summary

This proposal aims to close a few definitions and rules for Linked Wearables.


## Abstract

After long debates in the DAO and different proposals, there is a need to gather all insights, tell a single story and make definitions for this awesome feature to be successful.


## Motivation

This is the forth proposal on the Linked Wearables topic.

This is the story about the previous 3 proposals:

1.  The [original proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) (this one), where this feature was introduced and first described. It was called Third Party Wearables at that moment. Here is a short phrase that captures its intent:

    *In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.*

    The process to make Linked Wearables was simple, but there were some things that where not detailed. That’s where the second proposal comes in.

2.  [Submission fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) for Linked Wearables: As you may have read from the original proposal, third parties needed to buy Slots for each 3D representation of their NFTs. But at which price? The result of that proposal was to make it pair with the current submission fee for regular wearables. This makes sense, but if you dig deeper, some differences come evident. For example, Linked Wearables can not be sold in the marketplace, they don’t have rarities and are not exactly wearables. So it may be worth to be thought again and find a better balance.

3.  [Programmatic collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83351b70-a0a0-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a) came third to cover a particular use case that was brought up by interested third parties. The fact is that many communities interested in this have really large collections that were made programmatically. This means a software combined a set of pre-designed traits to get the final models as a result. With the fee defined in the prior proposal, it got totally restrictive for these communities as it would cost millions to have Linked Wearables, getting all of us far from the spirit of the feature, which should be inclusive by definition.

A lot has been learned from past proposals. Now, I’d like to propose an improvement that would help this feature to meet its true goal: **Onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.


## Specification

**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland** that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.

Linked Wearables are not [regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/). They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning.

Linked Wearables do not exist inside traditional wearable collections, have no rarity, and **can not** be sold in [primary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=item\&section=wearables) or [secondary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=nft\&section=wearables\&vendor=decentraland\&page=1\&sortBy=recently_listed\&onlyOnSale=true\&viewAsGuest=false\&onlySmart=false) markets. They are only **in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the Third Party.**

**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**

1.  **Create a DAO proposal** in the category **“Linked Wearables Registry”** to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available.
2.  Wait one week for DAO's approval. Ask your community for help, they can vote for you to be accepted.
3.  **Submit wearables** in the **Builder** using the available **Slots**. Once the item is submitted to the builder you will see a property called **URN**. That **URN** is the one that you will need to use in the [API response](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).
4.  Wait for Curators Committee approval.
5.  Develop the API.
6.  Spread the word! tell your community that they can **enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.

**So what is missing though?**

There are 3 very important things that were not addressed in the previous lines or need to be reviewed:

1.  What would be the **VP (voting power)** threshold needed for Third Parties to be approved (not discussed yet)
2.  What would be the final **price of each slot**
3.  How many items will **curators review** in programmatic and hand-made collections

Even though the price of slots were set at a fixed rate of 500 USD and the approach to curate programmatic collections was declined (details mentioned above), I propose the following combination to support third parties and, at the same time, being cautious of which third party is actually approved:

1.  **4M VP threshold**

This would be a blocker for scammers and people with bad intentions that don’t have a strong community and only want to abuse this feature by flooding the catalyst network with 3D Models. At the same time, only legit communities would pass this filter.

2.  **Free slots**

The DAO will be the only beneficiary from a fee here, but as the goal is to encourage communities to come into Decentraland, the DAO could afford this and give Slots to Third Parties when they need them.

3.  **""Reasonable"" curation**

Hand-made collections have to be curated in full as there is no guarantee on how each 3D model was made, but for programmatic collections, the perfect balance would be to:

1.  Audit the process

2.  Curate 1% of the collection

3.  Minimum of 50 items to be curated (if the programmatic collection has less than 50 items, it has to be curated in full)

4.  Maximum of 300 items to be curated

Curation fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn’t matter what type of collection it is.


## Conclusion

This should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer. We, as a community, also need to welcome them and make it easy to access but at the same time, secure. Please vote 😄.

**Voting Options**

**In favor:** 4M VP to accept third parties + free slots + Reasonable curation

**Against:** 1M VP to accept third parties + 500 USD slots + Curating every item in every collection

The overwhelming feedback was that this is a concept that will be highly valued and useful within the space, however, the focus should be to start smaller and grow based on the response from the community

We are therefore asking for a small grant initially to pilot the concept of a health education space, and run a small series of health education classes with a focus on some key health topics which will be of high value to the community.

What we hope to achieve long term;

Solving health inequalities;

*   Access to expertise across several fields of medicine, psychiatry and surgery, who will provide health education to the users of Decentraland (no matter where in the world you are from) 

Improving health;

*   Focussing on key health issues, we can aim to improve and empower users, through education, to make healthy choices and understand more about disease and medicine 

Mental health support;

*   With access to psychiatrists and psychologists, we will have a particular focus on mental health education and support. We know this is a key issue globally, and in particular amidst the global pandemic. 

Community driven;

*   We want to ensure we are delivering and catering to the needs of the community. We will ensure that the direction of our educational events are driven by the community, and focussed on the areas that matter the most to you. 

How we hope to achieve this;

*    Weekly live educational events Each week there will be a doctor led event, where education on a particular health topic will be delivered to the community. These will be interactive, and include dedicated time for questions and answers.  
*    Dedicated sessions on mental health Delivered by psychiatrists/psychologists, we will have sessions dedicated purely for mental health support and chats.  
*    A list of trusted health professionals We will continue to build on our bank of trusted healthcare professionals, all of whom will be fully registered and indemnified by their national medical councils.

The future aims of the project;
We are hoping to expand our project to run virtual medical clinics for the users of Decentraland. This will mean that you can access a one on one appointment with a fully trained and indemnified doctor/nurse for health advice/management.
There are several legal and indemnity requirements that need to be addressed in order for this to become a reality, and we hope that these can be worked out sooner rather than later (watch this space!)... this will be a world's first in the Metaverse.


## Specification

We are already in a unique position to access a wide number of leading experts in healthcare and medicine, to deliver excellent health education events.

With the funds raised from the grant, we will look to hire a programmer and developer to help with the creation and running of the events.

The funds will also be utilised to pay for the health professionals time during the educational events.


## Personnel

Project Lead - Dr I Farooqi UK based General Practitioner, qualified in 2014. Clinical education lead, Clinical Supervisor, and Covid Vaccination Lead

*    We will look to hire a programmer/developer with experience of the Decentraland user interface and platform. This will be needed to create the required platform within Decentraland to enable our educational events.


## Roadmap and milestones

ROADMAP AND MILESTONES

Month 1

*   Recruit an experienced programmer/developer to work on the Decentraland platform 

Month 2-3

*   Create and run a schedule for the educational events and mental health support events, booking in the necessary health professionals to deliver the events. 

Month 4

*   Reflect and gather community feedback on the above, and determine whether an additional larger grant is necessary for expanding the project

Since we are the pioneering web3, metaverse platform in the world I feel we should have the option to be able to upload PFP's (profile pics) to Decentraland name NFT's. Currently DCL marketplace displays all the names in grey background with white text. Opensea displays the names in colour background with white text. Not only this simple yet effective option will help highlight and distinguish one name from another but also but also make it more fun whilst adding further utility and awareness.

Another key aspect would be to have social media contact details, similar to what ENS currently has. I feel this would make it easier for finding out who owns that certain NFT thus making it easier to get in contact for collaborations, negotiations etc..

This last idea i propose is from a past conversation i had with a great friend of mine TheCryptoTengu & i came to realize that our wearables don't hold any Voting Power even though we paid MANA for them and technically staking them in Decentraland. I believe the wearables shouldn't be worth exactly what you paid for in MANA but it should AT LEAST be 1 MANA and maybe there can be a set up like minimum MANA per rarity. (ex: Unique = 100 VP | Mythic = 10 VP | Legendary = 5VP | Epic = 4VP | Rare = 3VP Common = 1 VP Uncommon = 0 VP )

## Linked Draft Proposal
[Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)

## Summary

The DAO needs a clear process for removing and adding DAO Committee members. This proposal is a Draft Proposal outlining such a process for community consideration.


## Abstract

The DAO needs to be able to add and remove committee members in a variety of situations:

*   When a committee member resigns
*   When the community wants to replace a committee member
*   When a committee member must be removed quickly in an emergency

There are also several needs that need to be balanced when making changes to the DAO Committee:

*   Decisions must be as decentralized as possible
    \-Only qualified and trustworthy candidates should be appointed to the committee
*   Committee members must be able to collaborate and work well together
    \-The committee must be able to act immediately in an emergency

Bearing in mind the situations and needs listed above, please review this draft proposal process for removing, sourcing, and appointing DAO Committee members.


## Motivation

**Currently**, the process for adding or removing a DAO Committee Member can only be triggered and/or canceled (within a 24 hour delay mechanism) by a Security Advisor Board (SAB) member. This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.

Adding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.

The following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.


## Specification

**Removing a committee member**

Each stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.

***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***

1.  **By the DAO Committee:**

*   Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)
*   After 24 hours, the committee member is removed
*   Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.
*   DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community

2.  **By the Security Advisory Board:**

*   The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon
    After 24 hours, the member is removed
*   3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window
*   In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member
*   Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member’s powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.
*   If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community

3.  **By the community by creating a proposal:**

*   The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:
    *   The name of the committee member to remove
    *   Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.
*   To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP.
*   The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.
*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.
*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.
    In the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.

1.  If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.
2.  If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.

**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**

*   In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed
*   The Committee member’s COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO’s behalf.
*   The Committee member’s address must be removed from the DAO’s multisig proxy.
*   The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications


## Impacts

This proposal will enable multiple pathways for DAO Committee Members to be removed, resign, and be elected to the committee. It also creates legitimate pathways for rapid response by the Security Advisory Board (SAB) and other DAO Committee members in an emergency situation.Up to this time, there has been no formal pathway for the removal or appointment of new committee members.


## Implementation Pathways

At this time, there is one DAO Committee spot open. Following approval of this proposal, the DAO committee will release an open call for DAO Committee Member Applicants, and follow the process outlined in the conclusion section below. Additionally, the DAO Committee will coordinate with the SAB to modify necessary Parameters via the DAO's Aragon infrastructure.


## Conclusion

**Adding a committee member**

The process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.

***Open application period (2 weeks)***

Applications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:

1.  What is your full name?
2.  What is your primary wallet address?
3.  Why are you applying?
4.  What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?
5.  What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?
6.  Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?
7.  Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.
8.  Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.

***Committee Interviews (1 week)***

Given how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO’s trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process.

The existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.

***Final community vote (2 weeks)***

After the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.

Votes to ban names go against one of the few major tenets and use cases of blockchain: Censorship resistance. We are very disappointed to see this being embraced so early in what was touted to be a censorship resistant environment.

Being offended is subjective so even the most innocuous names could be perceived as being offensive by any individual or group at any time.  E.g. Snowflake, Cracker, Yellow, Red, Brave, Monkey just to name a few.

The idea: Unban all banned names and switch to a user controlled ecosystem where each individual has the ability to decide on their own what they want or don't want to see similar to chat.  This gives users more control over their experience without anyone being subjected to or coerced by reddit/twitter style outrage mobs, while preventing endless future dao votes on the subject as people start to add or change characters over time to circumvent these blanket bans.

We believe this to be the most reasonable solution to restore censorship resistance and confidence within Decentraland while granting ALL users the ability to have control over who and what they want to see. If you deem something offensive all you will have to do is press a couple of buttons and it's no longer an issue.

To allow name banning in such a frivolous manner is to allow and reinforce prejudice by definition (not to mention the inefficiencies that come with voting and banning each name that someone happens to find offensive) As citizens of Decentraland, we believe users should be blocked and/or ostracized based on their actions; not what they refer to themselves as while also leaving the door open for any individual user to block any username/user they don't like without any time being wasted on feelings based votes and blanket bans that are far too often passed as a result of a single user having sufficient vp to get their way. This is neither healthy nor sustainable; the slippery slope is very real.

There are many recent examples that support our assertions.

To allow such censorship is to repeat the very mistakes blockchains intended to solve, thereby making it directly contradictory to the Ethos of Decentraland and cryptocurrency in general. If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read and don't forget to vote!

## Beneficiary address

0x8c127AB5762CB50C993a198b6187c0833746e404

## Description

""Kaleidoverse"" comes from ""kaleidoscope"" and ""metaverse"", indicating a glimpse of the huge universe from a small space. With a kaleidoscope in hand, some people see the abyss in the sky, while others see nothing in everything. We encourage creators to find their own worlds and to create their own wonderful universe.​
Since its launch, the competition has received a great number of outstanding creators from all over the world. The creators bravely and creatively expressed their own vision of ""Kaleidoverse"" in their designs. Hundreds of wonderful works have been collected in each track, including future metaverse fashion items, metaverse products with multiple values and innovations, and also delicate space design, exploring the boundaries of space design in the metaverse. We believe that these works represent the expectations of many creators for the future metaverse, and we believe that these works can realize their value and make a contribution to the metaverse. We'd like to help make them visible to more people, giving outstanding creators a chance to make their mark in the metaverse and help add more innovation to the industry.​

***Why sponsor this competition?***

**1. Increase DCL's exposure and popularity in the design community.**
We have collaborated with many art & design communities, media, software, and institutions, which bring excellent entries and a lot of exposure as well. Here we list part of the partners and their media coverage:
![avatar](https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1MBzzfT3MZ2HIgDARJkoCQUOT2Rcg-UTW=w2880-h1396-iv2)
If DCL becomes one of the sponsors of this competition, this competition will bring a large number of new users and new content creators to DCL, which would definitely make our DCL's community more popular and active.

**2. Increase DCL's visibility among the student community (Gen Z) and become their first choice to enter the metaverse.**
The competition has partnered with many prestigious art school student associations, including RCA, GSA, UAL, MAU, Pratt, LSE, etc. These schools will be promoting the contest on their social media accounts. If DCL sponsors these activities, it will become known among the art student group.

**3. The excellent works in the competition will be exhibited or achieved in DCL on a priority basis. Quality content will help DCL attract more users and facilitate its dissemination.**
Any quality metaverse works produced in the competition will have priority to be exhibited or achieved in DCL. For example, excellent clothing works will be made into wearable devices, and excellent space designs will be achieved in the land of DCL.

**4. The DCL community will receive some Kaleidoverse Memorial Badge for the competition and will be available at Opensea. (See badge on the contest website below)**


## Specification

The detail of ""Kaleidoverse"" contest: https://kaleidoverse.beamstudio.pro/

The total cost for the contest is around $50,000. The other sponsors we work with provide us with $30,000, and we hope DCL could provide us with $20,000. The sponsorship money provided by DCL will be used for the prize money for the winners and for the award ceremony and exhibition.

## NFT Collections Description

The Nyan Cat Collection is an official hand-drawn limited line of collectibles drawn by the actual original creator of Nyan Cat, Chris Torres (Me).  Each Nyan Cat sports its own vibrant personality based on events and holidays and can users can collect their favorites!


## Motivation

Nyan Cat is expanding its brand into Web3 and hopes to be your key to metaverse events and games. Right now, owning a Nyan Cat grants you a Nyan Pal, which is a flying avatar based on your collected NFT, and the utility already exists in Club Nyan Cat (94,-8).  However, with linked wearables I want Nyan Cat to expand its horizons and be available anywhere a user travels throughout Decentraland!

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Our mission is to build a DApp for event management & NFT ticketing which suits Decentraland's needs, we call it Fanszoid. And, also a custom SDK to facilitate the event creation in the Decentraland builder. Everything is detailed below.  We've been developing a lot for the last 8 months and this week finally launched our first version of the product. With this grant we will be able to support our actual team and bring more Web3 developers with our same vision of pushing Decentraland forward.

Also, we will have our first beta launch event next week, March 12 - 8PM UTC, if you are reading this you must attend =).

## Description

Our objective with Fanszoid is to address one of the biggest opportunities regarding metaverse events: monetization. Nowadays there is no organized structure for the monetization of an event hosted in the metaverse. In order to do so we will take advantage of blockchain technology to make NFT ticketing possible in Decentraland and build an SDK to facilitate its implementation. This will bring more use cases to LAND parcels and therefore increase their value.

Managing tickets as NFTs provides many advantages:

*   Fraud free ticket resale & ticket trading
*   Tickets sync with blockchain address
*   Royalties to organizers on each resale
*   The possibility of trading an event ticket post event because of the attached value
*   Tickets will be seen as collectibles
*   Native Integrations with Decentraland

Offering a ticketing solution will appeal to promoters and artist managers where they can easily derive revenue from sales where currently this is the unknown within virtual world experiences \[being mostly free].

Bear in mind that we have a lot of people that want to do things on the metaverse, but they just don't know how. Now, there’s a tool to help them do it. Therefore bringing new people to the ecosystem.

Our primary objective is to bring a lot of value to Decentraland and the Decentraland community, such as:

*   Make available a NFT ticket marketplace
*   Generate a new revenue stream for all event organizers
*   Increase amount of events hosted
*   Grow daily active users
*   Expand awareness in the metaverse community
*   Create more use cases for LAND owners
*   Build interest in brands sponsoring future metaverse events
*   Improve user experience for event attendees
*   Increase wearable sales
*   Surge wearable and build creations
*   Provide our building on the metaverse as a people to meet & network
*   Help make Decentraland mainstream


## Specification

In order for this to be possible we are building a decentralized application where users will be able to create and promote events, browse, buy and resell tickets, and manage sales and statistics in a dashboard.

We also have created the Events SDK that allows event organizers to give access to the event to users who have purchased tickets.

Link to the Github repo: https://github.com/Fanszoid

Using our Events SDK, event organizers will also be able to:

*   Divide their LAND into sections: General, VIP, Ultra VIP, and so on.
*   Dress users in each section with different wearables which will only be available during the event
*   Attach a wearable to a ticket that the user will be able to use in all Decentraland, creating a post event ticket valuation.
*   Add POAP’s to every event in one click with our seamless integration

Now in-person event tickets could be attached to a Decentraland wearable.

In addition, we are communicating with the Festival District team, who worked with Decentraland on The Metaverse Festival, to see how Fanszoid could meet the future needs of promoters who need a ticketing solution.

As a final detail, we’ve launched our MVP, feel free to try it out.

## Roadmap and milestones

Fanszoid’s team will report progress to the Decentraland community on a weekly basis and will monitor the project's forum closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

The proposed project will be completed within 3 Stages (approx. 2 months each) based on the following milestones and timeline:

Just to clarify, DApp and Events SDK improvements are done at every stage.

Stage 1: Foundation. Make possible the first event ever in Decentraland establishing the connection between users and hosts through our platform. Build partnerships with event organizers in Decentraland. Prepare strategy to expand and create all necessary teams. Design a digital presence in DCL (similar to Samsung).

Stage 2. Develop. Onboard new team members. Keep working on the DApp and Events SDK. Set metrics to track growth. Build the digital presence previously designed. Prepare communication strategy. Host monthly digital & IRL events. Build Fanszoid’s limited edition wearables for the Decentraland community. Host Interviews & Live Streams.

Stage 3. Launch. Finish the DApp and Events SDK with all the proposed functionalities. Provide 24/7 support, from organizers who use the SDK to users who bought tickets. Host many more Interviews & Live Streams. Make sure the community is rock solid and growing.

15662,15662,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should Voter Power Delegation be activated in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space?,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Overview**

On May 25, 2021, a poll was created suggesting the activation of VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space. The poll received **68% (4,322,367 VP) voting YES** (in support of VP delegation) and **32% (2,065,731 VP) voting NO** (in opposition to VP delegation). [You can view the original poll here.](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=fc6f60a0-bdb5-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)

However, due to the subsequent debate within the community, the DAO Committee recommended postponing the activation of VP delegation to allow for continued discussion. The Committee also called for the creation of a summary of the pros and cons of VP delegation to help inform voters leading up to this second, and final, poll in the DAO deciding whether or not to activate VP delegation.

Please carefully review this [report on the potential impacts of VP delegation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idxYsKqnpwH5IuwiCNE5Wu3AwXqGTNzilyqjK5M-S5Q/edit?usp=sharing) before casting your vote.

**Specification**

Activating VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space would allow users to delegate their voting power to any address in one of two ways:

1.  Via Snapshot&rsquo;s UI at **<https://snapshot.page/#/delegate>**
2.  With a smart contract by calling the &lsquo;setDelegate&rsquo; method

Delegating VP in Snapshot requires an on-chain Ethereum transaction, which incurs a gas fee.

VP delegation in Snapshot is not transitive, and a user who has delegated VP to another wallet can still vote with their own VP on any proposal at any time.

More details on how delegation is implemented in Snapshot can be found in the [Snapshot documentation](https://docs.snapshot.org/guides/delegation).

**Benefits**

*   Helps to mitigate the risks of voting with LAND stored in cold (hardware) wallets
*   Allows LAND stored in smart contracts to contribute VP to votes
*   Allows users to empower trusted subject matter experts

**Risks**

*   Increases the risk that VP will be bought and sold
*   Concentrates VP to a smaller number of wallets, increasing the risk of making difficult-to-reverse decisions
*   Increases the risks of community grants fraud

**For**

Activate VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space

**Against**

Do not activate VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space

## Linked Pre-Proposal
[[Resubmission] Should the legacy POI list be deleted?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=78635ac0-c4d8-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)

## Summary

Update the current POI management mechanism by removing the centralized list and unifying it with the decentralized DAO-maintained list, migrate that list to Polygon (cost reduction) and outside of Aragon (Better UX)


## Abstract

This proposal aims to solve the existing complexity created by having two POI lists, [one centralized under the Decentraland Foundation](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) and the other maintained by the DAO using an Aragon smart contract. The proposed solution encompasses: Deleting the Legacy POI list, and moving the DAO-maintained POI list from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon and outside of the Aragon infrastructure in order to reduce the costs and enhance the experience of adding and removing POIs. Finally, the DAO core teams will encourage the community to create proposals under the Add POI category in the Decentraland DAO Governance dApp to add the POIs that are still considered relevant.


## Motivation

As the project keeps moving towards an even more decentralized future, having a list that cannot be modified by the community or having two lists that community developers need to take into consideration when building products for the Decentraland ecosystem is a weak spot. Especially if that list contains such essential places in the Decentraland world as Genesis Plaza, the Decentraland Museum, or the Crypto Valley.

Also, moving the DAO-maintained list away from the Ethereum mainnet and Aragon infrastructure into Polygon will reduce operational costs (Currently adding/removing POIs cost ~200USD in gas fees) and make the process for the DAO Committee easier, as using Aragon to send transactions is not ideal UX-wise.


## Specification

Below is a proposed list of milestones:

\-Launch a communication campaign regarding this change and encourage Decentraland users to submit POI addition proposals for the POIs present on the Legacy POI list they still consider relevant (~30 days)

\-Once that period ends, the DAO Committee will engage with the Decentralad Foundation teams to orchestrate how the change will be done. This will be communicated to the Decentraland community via Discord and the Forum.

\-The actions to be orchestrated will be: Delete the Legacy POI list, enact the addition of the new POIs on the DAO-maintained list by the DAO Committee (Ideally those two actions should happen synchronously), and migrate the DAO-maintained list to Polygon.

\-Communicate to the community the result of these actions.


## Conclusion

By doing this we keep empowering Decentraland users to make decisions about the project via proper DAO Governance mechanisms while simplifying the operations and reducing the costs of adding and removing POIs. As the Decentraland community and the activity grows, being cost-effective and quick regarding these changes will lead to a better experience for the users. Also, taking out the embedded Legacy -POI list from the World Explorer (a.k.a. Reference Client) removes the control of a centralized entity and gives everyone the same access to leveraging the POI list on their own implementations.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

We are a small group of technical artists and coders who have recently fallen in love with the decentraland metaverse. Our plan in short is to purchase 2 ESTATEs and on them we will build a series of apartment buildings and townhomes. Apartments consisting of 1 and 2 bedroom floor plans, while townhomes consist of 2-4 bedroom floor plans. Rent in apartments will not exceed $450.00USD in MANA per month with 1 bed units starting at $225.00USD in MANA per month. Townhome rent will not exceed $950.00USD in MANA per month. We believe this project will provide the community with easily attainable housing that comes furnished as a place or places that can be used as a home or a hub for any metaverse business users may wish to begin creating.


## Grant size

50,000 USD

## Description

Hello all! And thank you for taking the time to look over our project. We believe if we receive funding for our project we'd be solving a few issues that new and existing users share. To begin, building affordable housing within decentraland would make it so the community members who don't have a large budget will have a place of their own. In these spaces users will be able to mingle with friends, host private parties, watch live streaming content on provided televisions as all apartments and townhomes will come fully furnished with the option of adding new items in the future. Everyone would love to have a piece of the metaverse to call their very own, but we all don't have an extra 14-15k for one parcel of land. I feel as though this would provide new and existing users an entirely new experience bringing a whole new element to the decentraland metaverse. Construction of this property will also create several new job positions within decntraland paying no less than $1300.00USD monthly guaranteed. These will include positions such as property managers & leasing agents. Any issues found in the apartments will be reported to the property manager who will report back to us and any issue should be hashed out within 24 hours. Everyone deserves their own corner of the metaverse and that's what we are trying to achieve for everyone. Thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.


## Specification

Once funding is received we would immediately go purchase the ESTATES required for building to begin. Once the land is in our possession construction will begin immediately using a mix of the decentraland builder and the SDK to ensure each user experience will be truly unique. Every member of our team has a graphical design background or a hardcore coding background so estimated build time will be 4-6 weeks after funding.

## NFT Collections Description

We've been working on random nfts for a while now. We started by helping artist turn their work into nfts. This would be our first successful collection, with plans to develop many more wearables. We have dabbled with generative art via the hashlips art engine. We feel smaller batch, higher quality is the way to go. Our first NFT that we designed is a 3D spinning cube with Gonzo in the middle. It is a unique 1 of 1. Whomever holds this NFT unlocks its special content, which is free website.
We made a few other random nfts before we really understood the concept of NFT collections, as we are not trying to get rich. We are a small design studio, but we'd love this opportunity to help expand the virtual frontier.


## Motivation

It gives us no greater pleasure than to help usher in the future of design and technology. We are a small but passionate studio. Ever since ocarina of time we have had a strong interest in gaming and 3d. As technology evolves so must businesses. Our firm primarily does web design and content creation, and we'd like to move all of our processes to the metaverse. On top of that, we are super nerds. Our overall goal is to expand brand awareness to the metaverse. By establishing an office that dual functions as a store and meeting place, we plan to develop a community that is fun, inclusive, and the best dressed avatars in DCL. At the end of the day we love to make cool shit on computers. Let's have some fun.

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

The Parcel will serve as a help and feature area for players in the DCL metaverse. We want players new and old journey a road less travelled from common highlighted scenes to find the hidden gems within Decentraland  just as we have done within the video guides and creator features on our channel.

To add attraction to the scene and ensure players visit we aim to change the scene regularly and update the content, but we believe a P2E element will set the scene apart and encourage players to compete for tokens which they exchange for NFTs and eventually wearables.

This grant is to build upon the help we have already given to thousands of people and kickstart a front facing scene within Decentraland that players old and new can enjoy.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x1816E73A6C50E8913047A9400b7DF822F7C666dF

## Description

DabPlay is a YouTube channel that began in October 2021. We have produced guides, reviews and helped content creators and players navigate the Decentraland metaverse. To date >25,000 viewers have found our Decentraland videos.

We have always taken the stance of helping out others but now we need the help of the DCL community so that we can purchase a LAND parcel.

Proposal:
Our LAND will be used to promote content creators, events and a healthy positive community feel as we help players navigate the DCL MetaVerse into areas less travelled.
This will be through our most popular guides being streamed in scene as well teleportation pads to featured scenes encouraging players to go off and explore the gems of Decentraland.

DabPlay is a YouTube channel so we don't have a lot to offer for a P2E element so we have partnered with a new NFT project called MetaDuckies NFT. This project creates 3D model duckies that have utility.

Currently the models are viewable in 3D and can be used in Metaverse houses / scenes as displayed collectibles. In the future these models will form part of NFT smart contracts where the holder can utilise their NFTs in the P2E game we want to build.

The P2E element will be similar to fruit catcher but themed around our partners and the project. We can't share more on this openly in case ideas are taken should our bid be unsuccessful but we will provide more info on this shortly.  The idea is that players will win tokens by playing the game which they can exchange for NFTs and eventually wearables.

Us:
We are a small team of 4 and have invested hundreds of hours into upskilling ourselves in 3D modelling and are starting now develop game concepts. We have made friends in the community who have provided invaluable help and guidance helping us to better understand the technical elements of scene building though we still have a way to go in building a fully functioning game. We believe nothing is out of reach and our creativity will allow us to build something amazing for the community to enjoy. We are realistic in understanding we have a lot to learn and will document the experience to help other growing scene creators thus, giving back to the DCL creator community.


## Specification

We will only have one parcel, so space for us will be limited and we intend to build upwards to maximise the space. We have been working on our design concept for a while of how the scene would look and have good working experience of using blender and builder which we will utilise if successful to build the scene.

Video boards will showcase scenes that we have discovered and encourage players to explore them through teleportation pads. Whilst help bots will provide insights about new events to encourage attendance and discourage bots / exploits and raise awareness of Metaverse safety.

In order to overcome technical challenges we intend to join the Last Slice Co so that we can contribute to the wider DCL creator community and utilise wider skills and expertise to build the best possible scene for Decentraland players and visitors.


## Personnel

DabPlay: (Team of 4) - Scene building, P2E concepts and community engagement
MetaDuckiesNFT: - NFT creation, NFT utility and P2E integration
Cyclopa: Technical advice and guidance

Outsource: CodEX - We will personally fund development of coding for the P2E element.


## Roadmap and milestones

If successful:

*   Month 1: Finalisation of our scene concept and begin design phase and scaling to bring the build to life.
*   Month 2 and 3 will see the video boards and help tools deployed whilst we work on the teleportation pads and continue producing DCL content for the community.
    Once deployed and with an active scene we will be working on the P2E element of a game and integration with MetaDuckiesNFT's creations for prizes and gameplay deployment in ALPHA testing.

BETA Testing will be set for a go live in early 2023.

These milestones are set to be achievable and realistic as we are a small team and still learning as we go.

## Linked Draft Proposal
[DAO Committee Compensation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9e324210-e01d-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)

## Summary

Establish a monthly compensation for DAO Committee Members, who are currently acting as a trusted proxy to enact on-chain proposals voted in the DAO.


## Abstract

The main responsibilities of the DAO Committee are:

*   Moderate proposals in the governance platform (promote to enacted, passed, rejected)
*   Keep updated the list of POIs, BanNames and Catalysts.
*   Create and fund vesting contracts for paying grants.
*   Calculate and execute compensation for the Wearables Curation Committee.
*   Basic Treasury Management (release vesting, transfers to operational wallet, swap funds).
*   Reimburse gas fees to the DAO Committee.
*   Pay any other monthly compensation.

Some other tasks related to the role are:

*   Attend monthly Town Halls and provide general community support.
*   Give feedback to proposals, evaluate risks and implementations pathways.
*   Contact external organizations in the name of the DAO.

A short recap of some important proposals that required a DAO Committee’s hands-on intervention in order to enact them:

1.  Mar 2021 -  [Original proposal to migrate to a gas-less voting system.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/proposal-for-a-more-accessible-and-affordable-dao/450)
2.  May 2021 -  [The new DAO launches and the first report is published](https://decentraland.org/blog/project-updates/dao-committee-report-1/) .
3.  Jun 2021 -  [Activate Snapshot Delegation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d43c1e50-daa9-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b) .
4.  Jul 2021 -  [Convert 1/5 of the Treasury to stablecoins](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b89db0-de87-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372) .
5.  Sep 2021 -  [Reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)
6.  Oct 2021 -  [Expanding the grants program for bigger tires](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c02ff450-2783-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) .
7.  Nov 2021 -  [Join Blender Development Fund](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7890f630-3ceb-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) .
8.  Dec 2021 -  [Keep Polygon transactions for free](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7af34c90-5d1e-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) .
9.  Jan 2022 -  [Resignation of Eric from the DAO Committee.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705)


## Motivation

In the past year,  [one committee member has sent +500 transactions](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc)  in the name of the DAO. Thanks to  [the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) , this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. **However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and those efforts are not being compensated in any form**.
Adding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement who can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.

**Compensate DAO Committee members is fundamental for a sustainable DAO operation.**


## Specification

Establish a monthly payment of 2,400 USD payable in MANA each month. The amount is established in USD to avoid problems related to MANA's price volatility.

Each committee member will commit to working 10hrs per week at a rate of 60 USD/hr.


## Impacts

Setting compensation to the DAO Committee will attract and retain members with the required know-how to take such a responsibility. Having a strong DAO Committee will ensure the timely operations of the DAO.

This proposal specifies a fixed compensation per month regardless of the activity of the committee member. This might be a risk for a committee with many members, where the work of verifying transactions is done by a sub-set of the group. At the moment the committee only has 2 members and this is not a problem, but it would be interesting to transition to a performance-based compensation in the future (e.g. based on the number of transactions initiated and signed by the member).


## Implementation Pathways

The DAO Committee already has control of the DAO Treasury and is responsible for making payments to the Curators Committee and funding Grants voted by the DAO.

The DAO Committee will issue the compensation to itself at the beginning of every month by sending 2,400 USD worth of MANA (using the current market price).


## Conclusion

Over the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. However this position has been voluntary for almost a year, and it requires substantial work from the members of the committee to cover their responsibilities.

Setting compensation for its members is key to attracting qualified candidates to join the committee and securing the timely operations of the DAO long-term.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Thred allows customers to easily build stores in the Metaverse. Our store admin dashboard lets users control their store layout, colours, and inventory management (NFTs). Our sophisticated APIs enable interoperability with the Metaverse.


## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xb26Af90041B13A3b795c45DC2F2b7E6B6ac6b593

## Description

Thred focuses on Land, Build, Grow.

We simplify Metaverse store creation from a familiar web2 interface.
This will drive mass adoption to the platform as users will be able to easily build up their retail businesses.

Brands can easily launch multi-chain stores: 20, 30, 40+ stores using a Decentraland Plugin.
Thred handles the Decentraland onboarding and store infrastructure.


## Specification

Much of our project is ready for deployment, BUT we do require access to Decentraland
APIs which would allow us to integrate seamlessly. Thred has its own REST APIs which can be called by Decentraland at any time to sync metaverse store data and reflect changes in their Metaverse store.

We offer NFT inventory management within our dashboard which translates to 3D objects displayed in their Decentraland Store/Building/Occupancy.

We also have partnerships in place with other Metaverses to integrate Thred into their platform. One of these partners is Metaverse GT.


## Personnel

Kazi Hossain is our CEO/Cofounder. He has a background in computer science and business management. He worked for several years in government agencies and private corporations in consulting on projects. He leads the team in delivering a phenomenal experience for our clients and managing our portfolio of partnerships.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/kazihossain1/

Arta Koroushnia is our CTO/Cofounder. He has a background in computer science. He sold his first sci-fi adventure game at the age of 16. He has developed software for private health-care companies and has extensive knowledge in the world of web3 development.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/arta-koroushnia-a18664157/

We also have a team of 4 project developers.


## Roadmap and milestones

Launched in February 2022

Multiple partnerships have been secured since launch including an exclusive NFT deal with Metaverse GT.

A NFT collection/management launch agreement for Liberty Gaming to the tune of $300,000.

Our objective is to continuously grow Thred into the go-to hub for Decentraland store creation.

The Decentraland (DCL) and Decentral Games (DG) communities both have an interest in establishing a MANA-DG Quickswap pool on Polygon (Matic) because DG gameplay rewards are distributed in Matic DG and the new DCL NFT marketplace will feature Matic MANA as it's native currency.

To make this possible, we propose the Decentraland DAO allocates $750K USD of MANA and the Decentral Games DAO allocates $750K USD of DG to create this pool. Each DAO would own 50% of the pool, so $375K in tokens will need to be exchanged between the DAOs so each can manage $375K MANA & $375K $DG. The pool would be initialized with $1.5M in liquidity.

QuickSwap can provide QUICK LP rewards as they do for the other two $DG pools on QuickSwap. Moreover, the pool will give DCL members a great opportunity to take part in the burgeoning Quickswap community and earn yield on MANA.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

We have decided to move towards the development of the project in the metaverse. ""*Ready Player One*"" describes the near future in the basic version.

We want to make the most convenient exchanger for customers so that they exchange their crypto assets and fiat without leaving the virtual universe, while the movement of funds took place in the real world.

Then we will open the virtual bank, where people will be able to store their coins and get a percentage.

We will make loans in the form of a vote - the participants will choose the conditions that suit them, but such that they **don't lose everything**.

Interest on deposits will be paid by making a profit from exchanges.

## Description

### Main project

The project is at an early stage of development, as only 3 people are working on it. Despite this, we managed to write our own program for the cryptocurrency exchanger, which stands out with speed and security.

The cryptocurrency exchanger is a central part of the entire ecosphere. We designed program so that it would be as easy to connect other services (for example, integrate the exchanger into the marketplace).

### Other projects in system

**Processing** - The user remains on the site, he doesn't need to go to external systems. This will speed up the payment processing from our side.

**Acquiring**  - Our own acquiring will allow us to reduce commissions for our clients. Besides, acquiring integrated into the system also allows sellers and buyers to receive additional benefits on our platform, for example, cashback.

**Decentralized marketplace**  - In our marketplace, it will be possible to buy goods for both fiat and various cryptocurrencies. This will eliminate one regulator and reduce fees. We will be able to minimize costs and organize healthy competition in product markets with a large number of small participants. At the same time, neither sellers nor buyers will pay commissions, which will reduce the cost of goods.

**NFT service** - NFT service with auction and stock exchange for art freelancers with all functions for accepting, distributing accounting and storing funds. The benefits for sellers and buyers are the same as in the marketplace - the services are interconnected and there are no commissions.

One of our team members is a certified economist with experience in large banks, so the economic model of our cryptocurrency exchanger is working and already brings some profit.
For other services, the economic model is also already being worked out.

But having a small team imposes its own limitations. We can't work on both the backend and the frontend at the same time. Therefore, the design and functionality in some moments lags behind the competitors.

### So, we need funds for

*   **Programmers** - to work in parallel on several modules;

*   **Web designer** - to improve the usability of all services;

*   **Lawyer** - to resolve disputes and protect us and our partners;

*   **Marketing and sales department** - to promote services.

## Specification

The main functions of the exchanger will be implemented in Decentraland. Our team will work to convert a simple exchange on the website into a currency exchange in a bank. At the same time, the user's avatar will be able to make exchanges both in the common space and in a private room - an analogue of a personal account on the site during registration. In addition to notification of a successful exchange, the avatar will be issued checks in Decentraland.

We want to visualize the exchange itself, as it can happen in reality with a virtual cashier. It will ensure maximum realism.
After that, the visual space of the bank will be created with cashiers, operators, etc. That is, the user will get the full feeling of being in the bank. Virtual contracts will also be created.

The exchange itself will be carried out through an exchange office, where neuroblockchain technology is being developed, taking into account the possibility of hidden transfers, transfers without confirmation, transfers with confirmation and multitracts. The ability to program tasks, create and track digital contracts and contracts, the ability to store data.

15677,15677,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should Decentraland have a mature content wearables filter?,"> by 0x6a77883ed4e65a1df591fda2f5252fd7c548f198 (Fancy)

SUMMARY

Create an OPTIONAL (opt in/out) mature content filter for wearables that may be deemed inappropriate or unprofessional.

ABSTRACT

As the wearables creator community has grown, a wide variety of items have been published that may upset individuals or groups.  This poll is being presented to the community to determine if there is a want or need to filter (hide) some of the wearable designs which may cause cause discomfort to members of our growing community.

MOTIVATION

Decentraland is a globally accessible platform that invites users from all communities to be able to interact, build, and contribute to the social and economic aspects of the platform.  Everyone should feel welcome and safe in our virtual world.  Currently the decisions as to whether an item should be allowed or not allowed fall on the wearable curation team.  This proposal aims to put the decision making in the hands of each individual user.  Anyone could choose to allow all mature content to be shown, allow for some mature content, or select specific items they do not want to see.

SPECIFICATION

Proposed classes of items which might be considered mature would include sexually provocative items which 'show too much skin', weapons, and wearables which have blood.  This proposal aims to put the decision making in the hands of each individual user.  My goal in suggesting the creation of such a filter is NOT to censor anyone.  I feel it would actually allow for even more mature content to be created.

IMPACTS

Anyone could choose to allow all mature content to be shown, allow for some mature content, or select specific items they do not want to see.  By giving each user the ability to curate their own experience, the need to curate this aspect of wearables will be removed and the team to focus on more important issues.  Implementation of this proposal could allow for more provocative wearable designs, more realistic weapon designs, and the approval of wearables which were not allowed due to violation of guidelines which the wearables curation team have to oblige by.

It would also allow for a more welcoming environment for users and communities who might use Decentraland if they had the ability to filter out mature content they don't deem appropriate.  Schools, business professionals, and other more conservative groups are among those who might benefit from the filters.

IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS

A default grouping system for each type of mature content themed wearable comes to mind.  Each group could be toggled on and off at the users discretion.  I'm suggesting one group for weapons, one group for sexually suggestive wearables, one group for wearables containing blood ect.  This filter would need to be developed by the foundation or an external dev team for these default options.

The addition of an allow list and a block list which could be accessible in a user interface panel would also be greatly beneficial, so that specific wearables of a users choosing could be shown or hidden.  By adding the contact address(es) of any wearable to the allow/block lists, literally any item could be hidden from view if a user chooses.

CONCLUSION

Everyone should feel safe and comfortable in DCL.  This proposed solution would give the power of choice to each individual user, and allow content creators to express themselves in a fully decentralized way.  If this poll meets the threshold for approval, I will work on developing a more in depth proposal.  I understand there will be a cost associated with the development, and will recruit the assistance of qualified advisors to determine what an actual cost would be.  My plan is to work with DAO committee members, code developers, and the community to make this proposal as solid and executable as possible.

## Abstract

This project is to create a mascot that can represent the common identity and spiritual core of the DCL. We believe that a high-quality mascot can play a significant role in the development of the DCL community as it will not only be a unique IP for Decentraland but also make Decentraland the first of the four major metaverse platforms to have its own symbol.

## Description

BEAM studio is a globally-based studio. We are committed to exploring brand-new ways digital natives interact with information, space, and each other, as our name suggests, Build Exciting Adventures in Metaverse. Meanwhile, we aim to bring together global creators to create various experiences to promote the process of metaverse construction and build virtual worlds beyond imagination.​
​

We propose creating a mascot that can represent the common identity and spiritual core of the DCL, which will help the DCL community to stand out on the metaverse platforms since this creation will be the first significant symbolic representation within the four major metaverse platforms. We believe that Web3.0 will enable the mascot to work even more functionally. The reasons are as follows.​
​

First and foremost, a DCL Mascot is a powerful marketing tool as it makes it easier for DCL to create a physical and emotional connection with every member. We think that because Web3.0 community members are from all over the world and in most cases, they don't have the opportunity to meet each other face to face, it has become harder for them to generate a sense of belonging. However, with the help of a mascot and more varied promo campaigns, DCL can easily bring the whole community together. For example, mascot costumes can be designed for members to wear in metaverse events, which will go a long way to making DCL members stand out and feel proud of their identities.​
​

What's more, the mascot will give DCL a competitive advantage on social media as followers are more likely to engage with the digital mascot. From Twitter pages to DCL experiences, a mascot can appear on various platforms. Mascot memes can also be created for DCL members to use on every platform.​
​

Last but not least, the DCL Mascot will be a memorable IP.​
​

The BEAM Studio Team and any additional designers will work closely together to develop a first-of-its-kind Mascot with a unique personality, interactivity, and emotional support.


## Specification

To begin this project, we will create a survey to collect DCL community members' opinions about the mascot and analyze the common traits within the community to decide on a mascot form that will perfectly represent the spiritual core of the community. This grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what they stand for.​
​

One key part of this project is to design the virtual character of the mascot. We will use AI, C4D, AE, and other design tools to produce digital work. If it's a human or animal mascot, we will design its facial expressions, clothing, colour schemes, etc. If it's an object mascot, we will focus on how to convey the community spirits through this item with a combination of visuals and metaphors.​
​

Before finalizing the design for the mascot, we will make sure that it goes well with all of these platform assets like logos, default fonts, and colour schemes. We plan to design mascot-related memes and motions in the future and plan to release these memes and motions on our discord server. The avatars of the community administrators will all be replaced by mascots, and information about the mascot will be posted in the server's announcement. We promise that we will promote Mascot not only on our Discord server but also on our other official social media accounts, such as WeChat, Twitter, etc. Through our vigorous promotion, people will greatly increase their awareness of the mascot, and the image of DCL's mascot will be deeply rooted in their hearts. When people see the mascot, they will think that it represents DCL.​
​

Finally, the launch of the DCL Mascot could be coupled with a marketing project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes to Decentraland as possible with this mascot. This will bring the potential impact of DCL on the metaverse, with the aim of further encouraging the adoption of Decentraland, highlighting how it brings the community together and enables DCL users to fund projects that they have faith in.

## Description

Our vision is to offer a hub for musicians, performers and other artists to learn, share knowledge, and expand and elevate the DCL community. It will be a community-driven venue for artists and musicians to perform in and launch their metaverse careers. The backbone will be learning through the sharing of knowledge. This project will offer a place for musicians to grow their skills, learn how to leverage Web3 in business and grow their careers.

We plan to re-stream archived programming between live knowledge presentations with a long term goal to sell video ad space for branded content and also renting out the venue to raise funds to sustain the growth of the collective once the grant funds are exhausted.

The team is made up of three founders who have dedicated many hours of time performing, developing and being a core part of the DCL community. Our experience is very well rounded in visual art, music and Web3 development. Complimenting each other’s skills and knowledge, we have a wide range of knowledge to share and a vast skill building curriculum.

All of the knowledge sharing programming will be free to all DCL users.

We have planned, hosted and performed in NFT openings, DJ parties, Art Heists, The Metaverse Music Festival and more. We are continuously on our quest to learn and share knowledge. We intend to do so with the following:

Establish DCL Creator’s Collective to:

*   Provide live streamed educational programing for musicians and artists
*   Mixing and mastering, music industry navagation and more
*   DJ mixing, turntablism, recording tutorials, etc.
*   Metaverse live streaming setup and optimization tutuorials
*   How to tokenize your services as a performer creating redeemable NFTs
*   Earn POAPs for completion of courses and other achievements

Provide community event space and venue to promote knowledge sharing

*   Giving the community of learners a space to hone their craft and promote their art
*   Live programing each week
*   Host resource board in-parcel for gigs
*   Plan events attracting and retaining new DCL community members

How the entire DCL community will reap the benefit of Creator Collective’s growth:

*   Providing knowledge sharing and learning opportunities for the DCL community
*   All programming is free
*   Attracting new, fresh talent to the space
*   More events for newcomers to explore increasing growth via the network effect
*   New businesses and organizations establishing their presence
*   A way for artists to enter the space equitably with financial stability

15681,15681,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should James Guard be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?,"> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)

### Description

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The Candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, James Guard ([https://www.jamesguardstudios.com/portfolio 1](https://www.jamesguardstudios.com/portfolio)) 3D Artist and independent wearable creator, was nominated:

<https://market.decentraland.org/accounts/0x470c33abd57166940095d59bd8dd573cbae556c3?assetType=item&section=wearables>

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.  This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Mental Health is a growing priority in society, with issues such as anxiety, depression, substance disorders, and sleep disorders rising exponentially every year. We believe that metaverse-based technologies can disrupt a multitude of different industries, including healthcare.

Metaverse Architects and leading mental-health service providers Mind-Easy, shall launch the first-ever mental-health support system in the Metaverse, with the help of Metaverse Group and Tokens.com.

We aim to pioneer what is possible in DCL, by developing a very first use case in the disruption of traditional healthcare services, by offering free tools, information, and general support to the DCL community in the form of Mental Health provisions and services.


## Grant size

60,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xC28f17063d8719AC111857521f49d9Ba90eD28e9

## Description

Our vision is to create an inclusive mental health clinic in the metaverse that will give DCL users access to the tools, videos, and resources to take charge of their mental health. This material will cover a range of mental health issues, and shall be accessible to anyone in Decentraland.

This will be built on land owned by Metaverse Group, and shall include the creation of an immersive, 3D experience, aimed at providing free, accessibile information on differnet Mental Health provisions.

Moreover, this project will aim to empower users to take charge of their mental health, and we shall prioiritise the formation and developlment of a community which aims to support and nurture the mental health of fellow DCL community members. Mind-Easy shall also work to provide free professional support systems to DCL Members, including free expert calls for DCL Members in the form of 20-minute expert sessions, which shall be given to the first 100 patients on the property looking for additional help and expertise beyond the free, immersive experience.

For extra inclusivity, the initial project will be designed and built to communicate mental health provisions in three key international languages, being English, Spanish and Portuguese.


## Specification

In order to integrate mental health support into the DCL community, the mental health clinic will highlight features such as; virtual therapy, peer support, gamified content, and immersive, 3D educational resources.

The clinic will also include therapy spaces, sensory immersion experiences, and consciousness exploration spaces, along with peer support hubs and collaborative exercise spaces to foster a positive environment for mental health and wellbeing.

Our primary goal is to leverage the possibilities and potential of the Metaverse to bridge the gaps in the existing mental health spaces. The clinic will be the first step in the creation of an ecosystem for decentralized and equal distribution access to culturally validated mental health resources for all users.

Here, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual therapy, peer support, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to the adoption and expectancy of cultural sensitivity as the minimum standard of mental health care.
The clinic will include therapy spaces, sensory immersion experiences and consciousness exploration spaces, along with peer support hubs and collaborative exercise spaces to foster a destigmatized environment for mental health and wellbeing.

Our strategic collaborations with Metaverse Architects, as well as the enormous network of researchers, psychologists, and therapists specialized in the unique needs of users allows us to create content and design spaces with every need of the user at the forefront of our development process.

We are currently in the early design phase of hashing out the aesthetics of these spaces to make them feel as engaging and calming as possible. Additionally, the clinic will integrate an already existing and previously approved grant project DCL Connect which will allow mental-health professionals to actively manage this space with minimal barriers to entry. This will facilitate the provision of cutting-edge DCL experiences for the Decentraland community, and shall allow our project to provide even more value to the space.

The scope of creating mental health spaces within the metaverse is quite literally endless but we want to begin this journey within Decentraland by focusing first on the unique needs of the users. Our long-term vision includes scaling to incorporate events, NFT creations, dynamic building of scenes and exclusive content.
By doing this, we aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use of Decentraland with the idea of making it the first metaverse platform to create engagement and traction for inclusive mental wellbeing

We are hiring a program director who can get us in touch with genre filmmakers for a fee and that usually works to about $750/month.
We also reach out to rights owners to negotiate a deal.
So far we have agreed to pay for the following films which we will be showing over the next 2 months with a total payout of $800 pending.

Javelina Run - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10461524/?ref\_=fn_al_tt\_1

REGIONRAT - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5677598/?ref\_=nv_sr_srsg\_0

We intend to acquire at least 4 more titles costing between $400 - $1000.

Total expenditure is expected for the month of March and April.

Title acquisition - $1800

Program Scout/Director salary for 2 months - $1500

## Description

As an Architect for the past 12 years, based in Tel-Aviv, and now in Toronto,
I'm pivoting deeper into the MetaVerse every passing day. learning new technologies and software to bring the XR world alive.
I bring with with me not only the passion to see this new world thriving but also the technicality of how to design and execute mega structures.

My vision is to create a mega structure that will bring together sharp thinking minds.
Creating a space not only to communicate and host live events like Ted talks, but also a living city, where technology is being conceived and created.
for anyone who's not only looking for getting inspired, but also to connect with each other, to bring their Tech dreams come true.


## Specification

taking in consideration all building & polygons limitations, the design will start hand in hand with advertisement for launching the project.

2.  Accepting presentations and showcases:
    accepting all solid technologies and ideas from people who would like to present on the platform, the content is being created and delivered by the community.
    content is uploaded either as NFTs/streaming into the Hub.

3.Planing deeper resolution:
As the material is received by the design team: we will deepen our resolution of each floor & street so it can host & accommodate the data/models/NFTs/streaming in a  better way.
This is essentially an online ongoing project that with enough capacity will keep the Architect team busy as well as investors/researchers and science enthusiasts.

4.Ongoing events in a Living city/Engaging with your Avatar:
The platform is now ready for day to day lives on the Metaverse.
Once we are ready to launch the project we will announce the first conference with the first 10 presentations of the most impressive groundbreaking technologies.

From this point:
Weekly & Monthly events will be announced and promoted on the WEB 3.0 to gather for the next Conference/SCI-Fi festival ETC.

Link to original proposal: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7890f630-3ceb-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5

The community has voted in favor of Decentraland being part of the Blender Development Fund, history made! There's nothing quite as wholesome as open source projects supporting open source projects <3

In the proposal I mentioned corporate gold for 5 years, but if we upgraded to patron level support for 1 year we would get huge social media coverage (which would spread to various forums / hacker news / articles / etc) and it would still only cost about 0.2% of available funds. For example, see how the public reacted to the news of Apple becoming a patron member.

The fight for an open metaverse will define the 2020s and Blender is one of the most important open source projects in the 3D creator ecosystem. ""A rising tide lifts all boats.""

Please read the original proposal first then vote on where you stand.

- Yes, go patron level
- No, keep corporate gold

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Pawnfi is a Non-Standard Asset platform that supports all the user to put their ERC-20 tokens or NFTs (721/1155) in work. That is, we enable NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.

By supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, we will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just ""buy and sell"" - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x6A44e6C59e2Fa54962e67a70Dd0A34FdC117Be85

## Description

Currently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or  Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow.

For this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi support users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.

However, Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre

### Pawnshop:

Borrower:

In this Pawnshop, we support players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short term cash flow without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long. Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a Loan + Sale

Lender:

When visit this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest revenue. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.

### Rental Centre

Builders

Instead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.

Renters:

Given building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only buy in secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not able to sell it in future. With this Rental Centre, players can try out new wearables for short term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.

In conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and build a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world we want to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, obtain the gaming experience without asking players to jump back and forth between different platforms.


## Specification

Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and we are a ready to launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will alr support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help us devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what we plan to enhance and improve:

**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we’ll hire UI Designer to help us build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place when go live and make the UX more immersive.

**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It’s vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.

**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre. While Pawnfi will normally charge service fee for placing rentals, for DCL creators we will provide rebate, which means contributing our service revenue to DCL community.

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

At ETHAnglia we are committed to developing a community to progress the understanding, adoption, utilisation and furthering of web3 within the East of England.

We will be running two events covering the MetaVerse, firstly, NorDevCon (17th June 2022) where around 500 developers will be attending, followed by our Gaming and the Metaverse event (21st June 2022) where a wide range of individuals from all areas of society attend.

Our team have experience of organising, managing and running events, we are looking for support from Decentraland to create a bank of usable computers to ""dive in"", as well as speakers for both events.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x3D53800346707B7F0c7bA3b2cA0dA1b9e951dCd5

## Description

Our project is a community building project, allowing us to build the interest, understanding and adoption of Decentraland in the East of England. It will allow individuals to experience Decentraland for themselves, as well as hear talks on the project at our community events.

Through the funding, this will allow us to bring Decentraland ""live"" to an event with an estimated 500 developers in attendance, as well as another event with 100 individuls (of all walks of life). This will cover Decentraland as part of the ETHAnglia community of events, including venue hire, speaker setup and having Decentraland marketed terminals to experience the metaverse in person.

We appreciate that the communities will only utilise the ""terminals"" for events (we plan to integrate Metaverse into future events, but this is something we are still planning, we wanted to be explicit with our deliverables for this application). To further the technology utilisation, will ensure these are put to good use by being used by scholars of our web3 academy when not in use by the events (https://ethanglia.org/education)


## Specification

The project will fall into three major catagories:

Confirming Venues and Speakers

The venue for NorDevCon is already confirmed and a preliminary speaker list including a number of high profile speakers is in the works. We have a couple of options for the Gaming and Metaverse venue on the 21st June. This will need to be confirmed. Note that we would need a live speaker for NorDevCon (17th June) but have and are able to support international speakers for the meetup (21st June) via Zoom.

Preperation for Events

Event preperation is already underway due to the scale of NorDevCon. We have full use of the room used for the web3 track on the Friday and are planning to use space for a Decentraland breakout space, as well as live interviews for content creation.

During this phase, we would need to spec and purchase the computers for free use at the events on Decentraland. Decide what activities, if any, we promote to engage within the Metaverse. Create banners to sit above the Decentraland area.

For the 21st July event, we will need to source a venue, arrange food and drinks, arrange ticketing (both Meetup and via Unlock Protocol).

Delivery

Sounds simple, but the delivery portion will make sure that members of the team are manning, organising and reviewing the use of the areas and making sure the maximum number of people are getting a good overview and use of the computers. Managing speakers, ensuring that tech is working etc.

## Roadmap and milestones

Milestone 1: Now - March 11th - Confirming Venues and Speakers

Deliverables to the team will be venue confirmation, invoice production for event venue and confirmed speakers for each event (we are hoping someone from Decentraland). This will include the topics to be covered and duration.

Milestone 2: March 11th - May 31st - Preperation for Events

Deliverables for this will be the outline of how the events will run as a document. This will demonstrate the use of the computers, what will be running (i.e. Decentraland event), how long each person will get to try out Decentraland.

We will through the phase agree internally the specifcation for the computers, as well as the marketing for Decentraland (we are currently thinking a wide banner to sit above the terminals). This will be agreed with Decentraland.

We will also outline the food and drink situation, have ticketing (free, but we do giveaways etc, and tickets are required) available and ready for the 21st, and update the community on its status.

Milestone 3: Delivery

Deliverables for this will be the events themselves, however, we will ensure that full visibility through our marketing (such as this video https://twitter.com/ETHAnglia/status/1492208434292404226?s=20\&t=VuyzReIaoYHbmx3skzAlBA) are pushed to show the excitement and outcomes of the events.

15695,15695,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should Grimey be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?,"> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)

### Description

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, Grimey, 3D Artist and wearable creator from SparkleStudios (<https://www.sparkles.studio/>), was nominated:

<https://market.decentraland.org/accounts/0x100eb445c9a826fd85c8d4ec4d5aecda418a7a92?assetType=item&section=wearables>

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.  This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

## Description

We believe that we are bringing new metaverse users to decentraland.  We have 60,000 people in our discord and ~3,000+ unique holders across ~6,700 unique NFTs.   Our user base is not the ""old school"" decentraland or ""OG"" NFT collectors.  The majority of our userbase is new to the NFT and Metaverse space.

As a project we have invested heavily in decentraland as we see dcl as such a meaning place for building our community and expanding our overall reach to the web3 community.
We are hosting a New Years Day party with 15+ Projects, a grammy nominated artist (Aloe Blacc), SpottieWifi, and hope to bring as many users online as possible in dcl.

While we love 'partying' in the metaverse, we want to show our community and the world what the next level looks like for Chibi Labs and the Chibi Nation in the metaverse.   We also want to create ""Sticky-ness"" and a symbiotic relationship between Decentraland, our NFT holders, and the entire DCL and Web3 community.

Our team and our community has been researching Play-to-Earn and we see a very valid use case for Chibi Labs and the Chibi Nation to build out a Play to Earn game in DCL.

We know that Play-to-Earn is the next way for us to show our community about the next chapter of the metaverse.  Aside from Wondermine and the casinos, play-to-earn seems super early in Decentraland.  We understand the importance We have been impressed with the ""Sticky-ness"" of Wondermine and hope that we can show DCL, our community and the world that our Play to Earn strategy will be fun, and keep users coming back.

We also seek your guidance and strategy as to what can and can't be done with Play-to-Earn in DCL.  We pride ourselves on investigating every edge of the Metaverse landscape.  At Chibi Labs, we  consider this just the beginning of our Journey in Decentraland.

As a project and as a community, we will always do whatever we can to increase awareness about the metaverse, decentraland, and web3 safety.


## Specification

Chibis P2E Game (Decentraland) (abbrev...)
1.Players will traverse the Chibi dystopian punk jungle to acquire 5-10 colorful GEMS in a Scavenger hunt type of format.
2\. To fit our lore, the ""gems"" would be ""Comprised of Silica"" will be placed in our ""conveyer belt"" room  in our Chibi Town to be converted into “microchips”
3\. Using ""Microchips"", players can redeem ""Chibi Coins"" (for DCL only)
4\. Daily Multiplier rewards to encourage daily engagement and ""Sticky-ness"".

Players will race each other to complete a timed event that will be a checkpoint race course through the map that can be redesigned to make for different races. ---Simply using a highlighted ball of light or something to indicate where to go will be enough.

POAP’s will be given to the high score of the day, and or one given to the highest score of the week/month. (1 of 1 POAP)(date/time/players name/etc)

Leaderboards need to be auto updated with usernames and times of completion

POAPs could be given to player with flawless victory (all 7 days in a week)

POAPs potential redemption process could include a chance to win a chibination
decentraland item or even an actual chibi

Leaderboards need to be auto updated with usernames and times of completion

Advertising Space on the walls of the Conveyer belt room and other office spaces needs to be easily changed for promotions and opportunities for sponsored ads

We'd like to add PLAY-TO-EARN to Chibination.dcl.eth.link ASAP.  As soon as we receive funding we would be contracting with a team to build this.

We would implement this PLAY-TO-EARN Game as a phase 1 program.  Implementation could be within 3-4 months.

Once phase 1 is complete. We can survey our community as well as the decentraland community and DAO for suggestions of improvements for phase 2 of our PLAY TO EARN game in Decentraland.

We feel that we are all still super early in this space and welcome the community to supply input, suggestions, and feedback of what they want to see happen next in Phase 2 of our PLAY TO EARN GAME.

In the short to medium term we feel it is super important to get started with the PLAY TO EARN GAME in Decentraland.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Cheers,

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Create, update and make freely available to the  community a top-down view map of genesis city. We will run a mapping script and update the content on the map every month.
A prototype of the current version can be found here: https://genesis.city/


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x97cB89Ccb1511Ee8BEeF1DfF74bFB8E39139B5FA

## Description

The scripting map is a fork of the official Decentraland explorer, modified to change the camera settings and automated to take screenshots of every coordinate in Genesis City. The website then takes all those images and stitches them together using OpenLayers, the open-source mapping software. The current version of the mapping script is a technical prototype and is very buggy, needing lots of manual interventions to complete the full map.
This grant will set up a budget, including salaries and expenses, to run this team for the next 3 months of developments and updates. Further grants will be requested by us in the future if the community is happy with our work, in order to continue to develop and regularly update the project.


## Specification

A prototype can be found on https://genesis.city/. Funds are needed to further keep the project running and to provide infrastructure and maintenance for it.


## Personnel

*   maraoz (github) - original map prototype creator, will oversee that the project’s vision is aligned with the Decentraland community.
*   Rodrigo Heredia - Full Stack Unity3d + Web Developer https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-heredia-36521084/ https://github.com/rheredia-dev
*   Anon experienced PM


## Roadmap and milestones

A fully working and updated version of the map will be live by t+31 days.
The map’s content will be updated via script every month for 3 months. Once that time has elapsed we will request another similar or smaller grant in order to provide further maintenance and updates.

## Abstract

Cryptohunt is building the Duolingo for crypto: a learning portal that onboards beginners to the world of blockchains and web3.

We know that blockchains have the potential to create a more inclusive world and financial equality, but accessing them is daunting for everyone but the tech-savvy.
We aim to work closely with blockchains to craft comprehensive courses and project descriptions that solve this problem, while Cryptohunt’s platform attracts new users.

Our users have been asking for more introductions to blockchains like Decentraland, but we are too small to do this entirely with our resources, so we are applying for a grant.
We have already introduced thousands to Celo thanks to their grant program, and want to do the same here!

## Description

We are building the Duolingo for crypto: a learning portal that onboards beginners to the world of blockchains and web3.

Our users have been asking for more introductions to blockchains like Decentraland, but we are too small of a company to do this entirely with our own resources. That’s why we are applying for a grant.

We work closely with blockchains to craft fun, insightful courses to introduce our audience to the major blockchains: What makes them special and why they should get involved.

We launched 2 months ago and already have a few thousand active users, and – thanks to our first grant from the Celo foundation – they were able to onboard through the Celo-native wallet Valora. Many are now exploring the ecosystem for the first time. So, we hope to do the same here with Decentraland!

On our platform, we already have created dozens of digestible, bite-sized lessons with topics ranging from the history of crypto, its potential impact, and the various technologies that power it all.

However, after completing these lessons, our users want more: They are asking for lessons detailing new projects, tokens, and emerging ecosystems, so they too could join and participate in the communities.

If accepted for this grant, we would be thrilled to bring that content in the form of a comprehensive deep-dive on Decentraland to them.  Given how revolutionary your decentralized metaverse is, we know our users would be incredibly compelled to learn about, and thus, participate in your ecosystem. Judging the success of the Celo campaign, we aim for at least a couple of thousand new active wallets and users.


## Specification

We have created a detailed slide deck and application document that delves into how our funds will be utilized, our course of action, and further details of what we hope to cover in the Decentraland course.

Our website: https://www.cryptohunt.it/


## Personnel

We are a small, distributed team of crypto education enthusiasts trying to lift all boats by onboarding the next wave of people to crypto.

Cryptohunt was funded by Christian Byza and Arndt Voges, formerly co-founders of OMR and Cozymeal. We held product and growth positions at LinkedIn, Ancestry, eBay, Adobe, and OMR. Our early hires include a Head of Design and a Content Manager.
We raised a small pre-seed from Coinbase, Flori Ventures, and Earl Grey Capital in late 2021 to get the product off the ground.

Now that we are live and have excited users, we are seeking this grant to help us build more educational content that will focus entirely on Decentraland.


## Roadmap and milestones

Milestone 1:

First, we would like to further develop your project page on our platform with more details on your ecosystem, provide a comprehensive overview of the MANA token, and highlight your core mission.
We also would like to provide a detailed tutorial on creating a Metamask wallet, purchasing some ETH, and making a purchase through your Metverse ATM. For this, we need to contract a researcher/writer and spend additional money on design and engineering.

Milestone 2:

Secondly, we would like to build out a thorough course highlighting your platform, token, overarching values, and mission for the future. We envision the course being around 60 slides, providing a deep dive into the functionalities of your ecosystem, token, and platform.
For this, we will need to contract a designer, researcher, and writer for the extensive tasks that come with fully developing a course.

If given the grant,  we will be sure to message your team on a weekly basis about the updates on our curriculum. It will take us around 8-10 weeks to fully build out, design, research, and implement the course onto our platform.

### Summary

As the DAO gains momentum and the community becomes more active in creating Decentraland projects and policy, the DAO Committee and the community itself have demonstrated a need for reliable administrative work.

The Committee needs someone to write the committee reports, keep track of grant updates, and hold community meetups. These tasks ensure constant communication between the committee and the community.

The community needs help editing proposals for clarity and needs help maintaining high standards of discussion in order to make use of the funds and talent at the DAO’s disposal. These tasks ensure governance remains accessible to anyone who has a good idea and easy to participate in for anyone with a good opinion.

### Objectives

*   Increase participation within the Decentraland DAO
*   Liaise between the DAO Committee and the community
*   Increase the amount and quality of community discourse
*   Help facilitate productive conversations and field questions related to the DAO

### The candidate

After the [open call for candidates](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-facilitator-job-call-for-nominees/1911/2), phergyson nominated Matimio on the forum, who then accepted the nomination. I had a conversation w/ Matimio and I believe he would make a fantastic DAO Facilitator.

""I am a PhD Candidate in Future Studies and Political Science, researching democratic futures, future governance models and the “biopolitical” significance of sanctuary, for example, sanctuary cities or the practice of seeking refuge in a protected space from the sovereign power/law of the state - something that may have increasing relevance in metaverse and blockchain spaces. In the Mevaterse space, I am:

*   An active member of the Decentraland community and member of the Lastslice Collective.
*   Building “The DCLSanctuary”, which is a POI and premised in part on my PhD Dissertation and aims to be an intellectual center of gravity for metaverse research, analysis and public policy.
*   Moderator for Deadheads NFT, primarily brought on to consult on issues of governance
*   Moderator for The Alien Boy NFT, also brought on to help with community management and governance
*   Project Manager for Cardano NFT Project: The Ronin Universe
*   I am already actively monitoring and participating in the DCL and other DAOs in the Metaverse and NFT space, and the combination of my academic/professional expertise and digital community facilitation/management experience, I believe, makes me an ideal fit for this position.

I hope to have the opportunity to work with and for the DCL Community, and appreciate you considering me for this position.

\-Matimio (aka: Mat)""

You can read Matimio's post history on the forum [here](https://forum.decentraland.org/u/matimio/summary) or search for him on Discord, Matimio#4673.

### DAO Facilitator Responsibilities

*   Compose and publish the Decentraland DAO Committee reports (include attending DAO Committee meetings and taking notes).
*   Compose and publish the DAO Community Grants updates. Summarize grantee activity regularly and expose grant project progress to the community. Flag grant recipients that have not made satisfactory progress.
*   Organize, schedule, and administrate community member meetups in the DAO hub
    To discuss current proposals, issues, and questions related to the DAO
    To be held as often as needed but at least once a month and accommodating various time zones.
*   Share strategic feedback with the Decentraland Foundation Governance team regarding community engagement and user needs within the DAO.
*   Schedule and organize community roundtable discussions for noteworthy issues
    \-- To be held as needed
    \-- Take notes and summarize for community

### Compensation

Up to 15 hours/week
2000 MANA/month, paid monthly

Over the last summer I have acted as a sort of proto-facilitator and begun setting up the infrastructure for a Facilitator to succeed (DAO hub, publishing schedules, stakeholders) and talked to many community members and Foundation team members to find the most valuable activities for this role. However, the responsibilities of a Facilitator should evolve to adapt to the community’s needs over time. What is written here is simply what I see as the most useful set of responsibilities right now.

- Hire Matimio as the DAO Facilitator
- Do not hire Matimio, pause creation of Committee Reports, Grant Reports

It’s weird to have to stand alone. Could the community suggest to the official to increase character interaction, such as sitting down, lying down, shaking hands, what  character interaction in the game is too single, which reduces a lot of user experience and reduces the fun and immersion of the game.

Some of us have played and try things into Decentraland as real believers but for now most of us do not have there place to exist in this metaverse because of to much high price of Lands ....

There should be a better way to organize current and upcoming events on the DCL landing page. I find that there is too much information for only one landing page. I suggest that we update the page to categorize events. For example, say if I wanted to just look for ""Gaming"" events I should be able to click a link and take me to all current and upcoming gaming events. Can do the same for other categories.

Category suggestions include:

1.  Gaming
2.  Art Exhibition
3.  Casino
4.  Music
5.  Podcast
6.  Education
7.  Town Hall
8.  NFT
9.  Religion

Those are a few to start with but can be updated over time.

- Update the DCL Events landing page to better organize things to do
- Leave the DCL Events landing page the same

Would be great to have a channel on Discord for each project that received a grant (some projects has more than one grant), so the team can post updates and the community can ask about the progress.

Would be a great way to have direct communication between Grantee and Community.

15715,15715,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,How do you all feel about Sandbox's Map? ( Image populated ) should we consider our own variation?,"> by 0x42b23bb838525d458f2b8109219ef45d229067b7 (WaifuWonderland)

So, my argument is that sandbox's world map has a huge advantage over our own and that we should consider implementing our own variation to DCL, specifically i'm referring to the ability for users to upload pictures ( often affiliated logos ) that represent who they are on the parcel map for all to see in a quick and intuitive way, feel free to go to https://www.sandbox.game/en/map/ if you havn't done so in the past to get a good idea. I feel that NFT's and images symbolizing various tribal groups often found within the blockchain environment  ( BoredApes anyone ? ) will become even more pervasive overtime, 2 days ago sandbox had a 24x24 landsale of over 830k usd shattering all previous records and the game isn't even out really, it is fast becoming a serious competitor.\
So aside from what i've said, i understand people will be against clutter on the map, so my proposition is to only allow users to upload an image to the world map after they have combined an estate equal to or in excess of 2x2 and that pictures would scale according to the following pattern 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc. ) this will be an obvious driver to the economy once people are keen to begin collecting several parcels of land and brandish their Logos in the metaverse, and last but not least.. with so much of the metaverse being tied to NFT's, isn't using an NFT( just an image ) as the main advertising medium an obvious conclusion? I understand that there will be issues with user generated content that will require a small amount of administration ( often explicit material is filtered by bots and never uploaded by bad actors so i believe the threat is low, and worst case scenario the dao will act accordingly in the future ). I hope that after deliberation you will see the numerous advantages this map layout will have on user experience in DCL and i hope you vote for! thank you for your time!

tl'dr : Should people with Estates in Excess of 2x2 be allowed to upload Images to the world map that identify their Affiliation.

- I'm AGAINST DCL adding Pictures/Logos/UserImages to ANY Parcels!
- I'm FOR DCL adding Pictures/Logos/UserImages to Parcels equal to or in Excess of 2x2

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

We are PETAVERSE - first & foremost Decentraland creators. You may have seen our collection of backpacks to carry your pet around Decentraland (GM #petagang)

But our mission doesn’t stop here! We plan on creating many more interactive experiences for Pet lovers in Decentraland!

We have recently deployed a V1 of the PetaPark. Our ambition is to improve this place, to develop games, showcase wearables & NFTs from independent creators & host events for real-life pet companies!

To achieve this goal, we need to expand our team & grow our visibility amongst non-metaverse native users!


## Grant size

65,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x6cca0FEb8906353561a0cF6EA8e305e7EE90d66b

## Description

We are a group of web3 experts and pet lovers who want to bring pet owners, pet brands, and creators closer together through interactive pet-friendly experiences in Decentraland!

The PetaPark in Decentraland is the hub of PETAVERSE. Our objective is to continue improving this place and work on two main areas:

Main building:
A natural garden style round building with 2 floors which includes a shopping mall, where you can collect pet-themed NFTs & wearables from talented web3 creators, and a nightclub on the second floor, where you can host cool events for your community!

The Game Park:
A place where you can walk, wash and play with interactive pets to earn PetaPoints & collect free wearables!

The PetaPark will be a great place to onboard pet companies into the metaverse and offer them the opportunity to connect on a deeper level with their communities as well as offer them exclusive benefits for their pets IRL (discounts, free pet accessories, etc…)!

To achieve this ambition, we will need to onboard additional Decentraland builders in the team!


## Specification

*   3D artists: Decoration & esthetics of the venue
*   Front-end & back end developers: scaling solutions for scenes & interactions.
*   Business development: Promote the PetaPark offer and onboard pet companies and more people into Decentraland!

Hey everyone,

It seems to be hard to search for a specific proposal I'm interested in.
Since there will be an increasing number of proposals in the future, should we ""add a search bar (e.g. kinda google search function)"" to the page to find these proposals?

Or even better, have tags on each topic.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Museum wants to continue onboarding people and teams to its art platform and we want to provide a premium experience for brands to be able to do so. For that we need more devs, 3D modeling help, and mkt and biz dev help.

Our community already holds a fan base of millions of users and we want to continue growing and start to take advantage of this.


## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x6240b908f4880Da265c2e55d5CA644B50a4Cb0d4

## Description

Creating cultural relevant activities that help gather the community around different art and social events and pushing forward the experiences that we can do with this. We have been developing experiences for the DOG project of PleasrDAO, the gather of funds for Lajos and  others. We want to bring international artist to the space and help the community explore new kinds of digital art with NFTs such as generative art, metaverse sculptures, wearables in an organic and unique way.

We are building up momentum on onboarding international artists and projects to the platform. Our goal is to provide a cool and professional experience to these brands every time, with the best we can provide as a platform, and the engagement we can generate with the right resources.

So facing the challenge of a bigger amount of artists and brands wanting to be in the district, we want to generate memorable assets and also make the museum platform better for brands and be able to execute a bigger scope.

We need resources for platform scaling, new premium artist activations and new artistic projects.

I wasn't thinking much about it, but 2 months?? I think is pleanty of experienced people happy to be a comittee member and be active as the lastest one are doing.

There is a current issue with other users impersonating approval mods in the Community wearables. They are requesting publishers to make changes to their wearables that do not need to be done. I'd recommend adding profile badges so we can easily identify the Mods. I checked the Curation Committee on the docs but they are outdated. I also went to see current moderators badges but I don't see any obvious badges that says they are a wearable approval mods.

Recently an invitation was extended by co-founder of Umbria Oscar Chambers to discuss adding $MANA to their platform.  Would you support this conversation taking place?
Please feel free to check out their discord's #community-support channel to verify this offer.  Search for Fancy#1446's communication brief thread starting on June 10th at 9:41 am CST.

I'm posting this proposal because historically the foundation has been difficult to reach, and I believe if added, the community would collectively save tens of thousands of dollars if not MUCH more over time. Currently if you hold $MANA on the ethereum chain, you must first swap it to another currency to bridge on the Umbria platform.

The Umbria Narni Bridge uses a novel liquidity-provision protocol, to speed up, and lower the cost of cross-chain bridging. The bridge facilitates cross-chain migration of assets by holding multiple assets on multiple chains, simultaneously, in liquidity pools.

The Umbria Narni bridge is different to other cross-chain bridges, because it does not rely on validator smart contracts, which can dramatically slow the bridging process. By removing the necessity for such validation, the Umbria Narni bridge can complete cross-chain transactions with an order of magnitude cheaper fees.

website: http://bridge.umbria.network
Umbria offers bridging at a rate that is as much as 10x Cheaper and 10x Faster than other bridging platforms.  Transactions typically occur in under 4 minutes at a cost of between $4-$9 USD.

Current supported assets from Umbria include: Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, USD Coin,
Tether USD, Polygon, Ghost Token, Umbria Token

*This is a Pre-Proposal Poll to gauge community sentiments and determine if there is enough support to move forward with a detailed Draft Proposal. Should this proposal receive 500K in VP, it will be resubmitted as a Draft Proposal.*

**Question:** Should Decentraland DAO participate in the Olympus Pro program? Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.

**Abstract:** Olympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs (e.g. MANA-ETH) while offering users discounted tokens in return. Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity. One of the primary benefits of the Olympus Pro program is that it can create a new revenue stream for the DAO, by owning MANA-ETH liquidity and starting  to capture the trading fees. At the time when this proposal was written, the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.

Olympus Pro is the partnership program of Olympus DAO. More information on Olympus DAO and the Olympus Pro program can be found at the following links:

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Runixcoin is a Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform that has its own Token, Runixcoin which runs on the Polygon Network. The key components of this project are to feature a LAND which will include mineable rocks that can be used to claim RUNIX tokens which can be swapped for MANA. This will give more opportunities for players to make money on Decentraland and help promote the MANA token. Many additional functions including NFT's full integration onto the LAND will enable users to gain bonuses when mining. This LAND will promote the growth of users on Decentraland and increase motivation to stay online because people will be making good money. I am the CEO of Runixcoin and our skills include professional programming development, and a great team


## Grant size

250,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x63948f87aef43558369aaf9e526201824052985f

## Description

Funding will be used to allocate LAND for Runixcoin and will be a LAND that contains many rocks that will be able to be mined within the Decentraland Game. The rocks that are mined will reward players with Runixcoin Tokens that can be traded on the Uniswap exchange platform. Integration of this LAND will allow users to swap between RUNIX and MANA and give more access for users to obtain MANA via different routes. This integration will bring many Runixcoin customers to Decentraland and full integration will be mind-blowing.  Current objectives are to help newcomers who do not know how to deposit Polygon MANA onto their accounts, Runixcoin Exchange platform is a way to help users to do this along with being able to actually profit while being on the LAND.


## Specification

The project will be completed via creating the LAND and all of its components and have it linked to the Runixcoin Cryptocurrency Exchange along with the tokens. The tools and methods that will be used are Web3 and connections to the Runixcoin Cryptocurrency Exchange. There will be different tiers of Rocks that can be mined which will grant higher rates of mining of the Runixcoin Token. The Runixcoin Token will then be able to be swapped for MANA using the polygon network and Uniswap. Current progress includes full development of a cryptocurrency exchange platform that will be soon integrated into Decentraland upon approval.

## Roadmap and milestones

Roadmap will include completion of the LAND and the ability to claim RUNIX tokens to a Polygon (MATIC) Receivable Address. Progress that will be made will be given weekly, it will start with creation of the LAND. Next milestone will be adding different rocks that can be mined. These rocks after being mined will be converted into ore. The ore then can be used to convert into ingots which can be used to turn into Runixcoin Wearables that will be minted to users. Alternatively, the ingots can be converted into Runixcoin tokens which can then be converted into MANA or any cryptocurrency of choice, linked to the player's wallet. Full integration and updates will come weekly/as frequently needed, and long-term dedication to this project is at upmost importance to the Runixcoin Team. Updates will be posted frequently and long-term development will be key in success of this excellent project.

We propose that Decentraland scenes also become NFTs so that creators can monetise their work and also be rewarded for it.

The ultimate question this poll is trying to answer is: Who is building the Open Metaverse?

The current representation of the Metaverse remains empty. Stakeholders want to embrace the Metaverse, but they are faced with vast plots of land that remain empty. In addition, not every landowner can afford to purchase bespoke designs.

To keep users entertained, the Metaverse requires a lot of content. Virtual amusement parks, concerts, casinos, movie theaters, conferences, universities, etc. The Metaverse is a new area full of possibilities for architects/designers, as well as a new realm free of the limits of the physical world. This is evident in a lot of Decentraland building designs. For consumers who wish to gather one-of-a-kind assets, architects/designers can construct unique designs supported by NFT technology. Architects/designers can create digital assets such as cities, buildings, furniture, sculptures, point clouds, textures, and so on, and sell them to virtual worlds many times.

Architects/designers can now become content producers, leveraging their efforts for exponential development through Decentraland, similarly to how the marketplace works currently for land and wearables, while at the same time reaching out to potential consumers with excellent material, keeping them engaged, and growing Decentraland’s user base.

As a result, we'd want to pose the question to the current users of Decentraland and ask if scenes should also be NFTs, allowing architects who are now content creators to directly profit from the Decentraland Marketplace but also make them willing to sell their designs and embrace the platform. We also believe this will attract higher quality architects, designers, and content creators to Decentraland, so more buildings will be readily available for everyone to purchase and place on their land.

I am looking for a smart contract that allows the sale of land over a period of payments. For instance, I own a piece that I am looking to sell for 12,000 mana. I have made an agreement to sell it for 1,000 mana per month for 12 months. During the 12 months, as long as payments have been made, the buyer can be the operator of the land and once the final payment is made they receive the transfer. If they miss a payment or two (subjective), the land stays with me. This is already done in the real world and I think it will open up land purchases to people who dont have all the capital up front while also incentivizing investors like my self. Has anyone seen this or have any guidance on creating it?

## NFT Collections Description

We have created a collection of 40 NFT wearable sneakers in collaboration with 25 of the hottest web3 projects, including exclusive models created in partnership with Decentraland, Polygon and The Sneakerheadz Society.

Across the 40 designs in the collection, there are a total of 5,000 pairs of sneakers. These NFT wearables are the world's first Italian handmade leather phygital sneakers which you can wear exploring Decentraland, or you can burn the NFT to redeem the identical physical pair of sneakers to wear in real-life.


## Items to be Uploaded

40

## Intellectual Property

This is a collaborative project between Another-1 and Swappable by TrustSwap.

You can find out more about Another-1 and their team here: https://another-1.io

You can find out more about Swappable here: https://swappable.io


## Motivation

We are super hyped to bring our wearables to Decentraland!

We're excited to share our sneakers with the DCL community, and all the exceptional communities of the projects we've collaborated with to create NTR1-META's, so all can enjoy and wear our remarkable sneakers!

We moved into Crypto Valley 1.5 years ago, made ourselves at home, and put on some wild events for the community in TrustSwap HQ. We're now taking our involvement with the community to the next level by dropping these wearables!

NTR1-META sneakers are inspired by the magic of the chameleon. Our team admires the human ability to change in the face of adversity, much like how the chameleon morphs the color of its skin cells to survive in the most challenging circumstances.

Right now with a proposal requiring 1 Mill VP, if theres is 1M VP in YES votes, and 0.9 Mill VP in NO, the proposal will pass even being clearly controversial.

What I propose is to leave the current thresholds, but that the amount needed to pass is calculated from the different between YES and NO, instead of just the absolute amount in YES.

## Description

Problem: Metaverse compatibility is often referred to as a development priority in the web 3 space, assuming that any in-game asset can be easily moved between platforms. Compatibility with digital fashion is the holy grail of this task. NFT technology promises interoperability, but all games/metaverses/apps have different avatars, graphic styles, and poly-counts for assets. There is no standard. So we also have multiple 3D files for each digital outfit. In order to support “interoperability” companies drop separate NFTs compatible with different metaverses. They are not linked. It is just creating a new copy of the design. None of them are compatible. They are not very useful for use outside of the platform on which they were created, and duplicating designs for portability to different worlds blurs the ownership, value and uniqueness of assets.

Solution:
We’ve built an infrastructure that allows a single EVM-compatible asset to be worn not only in the game marketplace it was bought in, but in all worlds, everywhere it goes it converts to the appearance of the platform it’s in. We tap into the backend of metaverse marketplaces to make these assets tradable in-game. On the contrary of our competitors, who drop separate NFTs compatible for the different virtual worlds, our infrastructure does not create a duplicate of NFTs. Each 1 NFT works as an access pass to the compatible version of 3D asset for multiple metaverses/games/VR/AR/Zoom filters etc.

Decentraland have been the first who started to support linked wearable, but our project serves to extend this capability to many other worlds and provide single window for the users/brands/metaverses.

## Abstract

Help Decentraland’s biggest Realtor in the Rental Market.

Let's keep making DCL being the best Metaverse in the world. We need to continue improving with onboarding new users, and making it easier for people to understand the platform. It needs to be easier to access land, create content and get solid advise in a secure way, on the same time giving value and income to DCL long term.

Help us, help growing the community! - We want to help onboard new users, advise them properly and make renting land easier.

Every land that gets rented, we’ll reward the community as thanks for trusting us = 5% on every sale in commission, which goes directly to the DAO committee wallet. It's managed by official DAO committee members Yemel & HPrivakos.


## Grant size

22,500 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x29519122d08771Ca4c83C8E3Fa981Df18721f76D

## Description

With the smart-contract rental model, we can lower the rental fee's to build and contribute, which will attract more users onboard and have fun in Decentraland.

WHAT WE SOLVE OF PROBLEMS AND GAINS FOR DECENTRALAND

*   Better user-experience for new users
*   We onboard tons of new people, and answer their questions regarding the best Metaverse Decentraland
*   We help generate income and new business to Decentraland
*   We help land gets REAL content. We connect P2E games, NFT galleries, Meta Breweries and much more to land-owners
*   We need it to be EASY to be a consumer and content creator in Decentraland.
*   Prevent scamming and advising users properly

We're ready to do our part to IMPROVE Decentraland, and bring growth and income to the Decentraland foundation, on the same time we bring value to the platform, so we can continue being the best metaverse in the world.

On a short notice:

*   We want to create the best Rental Experience in Decentraland, where land-owners easily can become ""landlords"". Way too much land are empty. We need content, exciting areas and places to visit to make sure we continue grow our platform. We are solving this with our Realtor Rental Platform. We need a smart-contract to ensure the transperency, security and easy-ness to make sure Decentraland Rentals are accessable to all.

And YES, we know there are platforms like Double and LandWorks - but they are not the biggest, most active and have the same level of live-chat-support (and even video-calls) like DCL Real Estate does. This is why DCL Real Estate is now requesting a grant from the great and amazing community and DAO in Decentraland. Help us govern the Rentals in Decentraland.
We will provide a technical great solution, which is already in the making. It will be easy to get answers from resources from our Decentraland Experts.. Most users leave the DCL community because they don't understand how our world works - this is why Agents and Trusted Advisors are important.

This is why we propose, the DAO help us funding our DCL REAL ESTATE RENTAL PLATFORM v2. We're the biggest and best Realtor in Decentraland with most results, and we ask you to help us.

With this grant, we will be able to create the best rental-platform, that Decentraland has seen. Even more it will have features such as LIVE SUPPORT, Land advise, Scene catalog, Free Scenes to publish, Verified scene makers with live support and best of all - as thanks for the grant we will give back Decentraland and the DAO - 5% in commission on EVERY sale/rental we get on the platform.

DCL Real Estate is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get users to interact with the platform in Decentraland, which means use the land as content creation, get buyers and tenants to meet the landlords and sellers, and create a better Decentraland.

A short introduction about us - DCL Real Estate is the biggest and one of the first realtors in Decentraland. We provide services such as “Selling”, “buying”, “Leasing land”, and “renting land” services.

We’re onboarding new users to Decentraland every day, and we keep on being one of the first encounters on many occasions when people explore how they can get started building and further grow Decentraland, with lands and content. With granting us the funds we will be able to grow the land- and rental market within Decentraland, and on the same time making DCL Real Estate decentralized through giving DAO shares, on 5% on every sale.


## Specification

Blockchain: Ethereum

Tools:

*   vscode, hardhat, metamask for smart contract
*   React, redux, tailwind for website
*   React, redux, react native for app

Issue: the community is riddled with scammers within a peer to peer transactional space. This results in lower trust in Decentraland, and therefore less community usage and interaction. It also empowers easy access to rent, with possibility to access a Trusted Advisor who knows the DCL space, and on the same time access utilities such as a free scene - and income to the DAO which means the people of Decentraland.

Solution: this rental smart contract will provide additional comfort for land owners and prospective buyers/renters, as they will no longer have to worry about being scammed. We will become an added small business within decentraland, bring additional volume, and showing evidence of successful business operations within a leading metaverse platform.

Users can easily:

1.  Tenants can easily rent lands easy on the site
2.  Landlords can list their lands easy on the site.
    \---> Free Scene access
    \---> Premium Scenes access
    \---> Live Support from DCL Experts (Building experts, Land experts, General support)
    \---> Help to increase security and prevent scam
    \---> 5% commission to DAO/DCL on each sale/rental.

THE PROCESS TO RENT (As a Tenant)

1.  User connect wallet
2.  User find the wanted land, and press ""rent land"" and pay's (For example 1-12 months)
3.  Landlord automaticly get's operator assigned to tenant's address or manually add another operator
4.  Money gets in Escrow wallet
5.  Money gets released after 30 days to landlord (+ DAO fee and Platform fee's withdrawn)
6.  Tenant will automatic pay every 30 days, and the lease will end if payment has failed, and other tenants will be able to access and rent the landlords' land.

THE PROCESS TO LEASE (As a Land-owner/Landlord)

1.  User connect wallet
2.  User press ""List land"" choose how much they want to earn, rental period etc.
3.  Landlord signs smart-contract.

IMPORTANT TO NOTICE:
A landowner can ALWAYS remove operator or sell a land. It is not possible to make sure they can't, so this is a fully secure rental-system which will provide security for the tenant's funds, and landlord's land asset. This is why this project DO NOT transfer any land-nft-asset but simply acts as a money-middleman, and takes a fee for doing it automatic, easy and cheap. If a landlord/landowner proceed to remove operator/sell the land after renting it out, the tenant will be refunded, and the land-owners' address will be noticed as a ""Bad Landlord"".

DAO will get income from the sales and rentals, aswell as the landlord and realtor platform fee's.

Payments and commissions to DAO will be sent to:

*   Either DAO directly: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a6ebe7e2a7722f8200d0ffb63a1f6406a0d7dce

*   Or Multisig owned by the DAO Committee (Yemel and HPrivakos): https://etherscan.io/address/0x89214c8Ca9A49E60a3bfa8e00544F384C93719b1

We will make the smart-contract and address changeable, because DAO is still new and it's growing fast so we might need to change in the future, after advise from DAO committee members.

## Roadmap and milestones

This project will be completed within 6 weeks-6months. And the roadmap is as follows:

*   Month 1-3: Development of the FUTURE of Rental platform. UI and UX designing, Smart Contract Development & Website app creation

*   Month 4: Code Audition

*   Month 5: Internal Testing, Debug and Code Polish. Also development of resources, tips, tricks, videos and onboarding to platform and DCL.

*   Month 6: Official launch and income generating

We strive to make the project release before it's due. But it's important EVERYTHING is perfect, and make sure the quality of the project.

To keep track of all of the related update, we'll release reports and share them on our Discord & in the DAO grant community on their discord: https://discord.gg/XBjCRTbRZP - but we will also be ready to answer questions on the forum and on email.

The DCL Real Estate already implemented rentals and sold results for more than 27+ clients and  smart contracts will make rewards and security better and easier combined with advisory to new users of DCL to make Decentraland the best Metaverse, so it makes sense for DAO to do this execution.

15740,15740,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Enhance flexibility for wearables creators in collections,"> by 0x5a659a97dfbd423a8824d472c879135b7e6c2227 (deadstock)

As it stands today, wearables creators must publish the entirety of their collection at once. There is no ability to add to it after it's originally been published.  For any creator trying to bring new items to market on a regular rhythm - versus all at once at the beginning - this leads to a bad consumer experience, as the newer wearables must be created, approved and published in a new collection with a different name.

Creators should have the ability to flow newness into their existing collection over the course of a year, thus creating excitement with avatars/players and a reason to revisit a shop/marketplace.  Imagine:  sneaker drops from your favorite creator 4x/year or apparel creators launching t-shirts and jackets on a seasonal basis,  all under a single, easy to shop collection taxonomy.  In other metaverses, the artist has the ability to do this.

This proposal specifically is to enable artists to manage their collection by adding items over time instead of the collection being locked in upon the initial mints.  To be clear, the proposal calls for the same DAO item-level approval as happens now.  This is decidedly NOT a proposal asking the DAO to grant approval on the first items and then carte blanche ability for the artist to do whatever they want in the later ones.   The DAO will still maintain approval at the item level, and artists will revert back to the DAO when ready to extend their lines of product.  This change would simply allow artists to choose whether to publish in a separate collection or to add to their existing, likely master, collection.

Ultimately, it is DCL players that benefit as they will be able to more clearly track newness and shop from artist collections they prefer.  Plus, the marketplace browsing will be less cluttered.   As it stands today, many artists have multiple collections - upwards of 10 - and to scroll through these takes time for the shopper.  Allowing an option of a single master collection will streamline browsing and buying for DCL consumers.

At the moment there is no moderation in place for experiences deployed to Decentraland. We need a moderation system that allows users to customize the kind of experience they want.

This proposal is about providing a way to tag scenes under the pre-defined categories such as violence, drugs, sex, gambling, etc. To be defined in the following DRAFT proposal.

This tagging will be done by a committee reviewing all scene deployments and making sure the tags apply to them. Any community member will also be able to report a scene with incorrect tags.

The reference client will use the scene tags to allow users to customize their experience and also provide sensible defaults to newcomers.

POIs already exist and are a great way to introduce people to new destinations, but the introduction of Personal POIs may encourage users to continue to visit and engage with their favorite destinations.

due to the massive increase in interest, the price of mana has increased to the point where if someone new wants to create a wearable it will cost them $2500~. This is limiting the amount of creativity that is possible within dcl. So I propose that the cost to mint is reduced is lowered to 50 mana but will scale as follows: 2nd mint 100 mana, 3rd mint 250 mana, 4th mint 500 mana at which it will be capped. This should help to kick start smaller creators and will mean that only the most creative/entertaining creators become successful. Doing this Should overall create a profit for the DAO as although the price is cheaper it will encourage more people to get creating

Should the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

I develop scenes for Decentraland and in every possible way promote the metaverse in the Russian community.

Now the Russian community is actively interested in the metaverses and the Decentraland may become the first experience of interaction with the metaverse.


## Grant size

1,500 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xEF50b5b77b9469fD171eE3A3Fa375c303AF51031

## Description

The project solves the problem of the language barrier between Decentraland and Russians, many of whom do not know English well, and Google translator is not able to make a quality translation.

The appearance of Russian-language documentation will lower the threshold for entering Decentraland and will give an influx of new users and content makers: programmers, designers. Some may even improve their English skills in the course of their studies or experience the blockchain, the metaverse, for the first time.


## Specification

I use a GitBook with a GitHub repository:

https://github.com/demid-osman/ru-docs-decentraland

Here you can see how the translation on the topic of the Glossary looks like:

https://demid.gitbook.io/ru-docs-decentraland/osnovy-ethereum/glossarii


## Personnel

I'm working on a project by myself, but anyone can help me with this by submitting a pull request or an issue on github.

How will my translation differ from another translation? I have experience designing scenes for the Decentraland and therefore can accurately convey the concepts that are used in the Decentraland, you can see some of my work on my YouTube channel.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZppsmkJ8n1QlGzuscDDZdg


## Roadmap and milestones

I will publish a link to the Russian documentation in thematic and developer chats. Use a link in posts and links in materials about the Decentraland.

A couple of chats where the Russian community is located:

https://t.me/decentraland_ru

https://t.me/developers_metaverse

If the grant is approved, I will be able to devote much more time than I have now. I will start translating materials from top to bottom.

1 - World

2 - Market

3 - Create

4 - Ethereum essentials

The result of the translation can be checked immediately on the website:

## Abstract

Blockchain Homes aims to develop a decentralized application that leverages blockchain, crypto, and NFTs to facilitate real estate connections. The first step to facilitating a RE transaction on the blockchain requires us to digitize a real world property using drone footage, architectural schemes, and 3D modeling allowing us to create an immersive NFT of the physical asset. Having an NFT rendering of the property allows us to potentially move into different metaverse assets. Allowing people to create a duplicate digital property will improve and increase the number of users in decentraland and help develop the ecosystem much quicker. Outside the metaverse our goal is to improve the speed, transparency, and security of RE transactions.

## Description

Outside the metaverse our decentralized app will allow allow people to invest in and buy properties globally, improve and move land registries plus titles to the blockchain, increase transparency of transactions and market activity, create a 3 layer security protocol, and allow people to maximize profits when selling because it is a much smaller fee to list and promote property. When tokenizing properties, firms with large amounts of assets can easily inspect, control, or liquidate assets much easier. Tokenizing a property also means the ability for people to leverage assets to receive loans and build generational wealth. Whole countries will benefit because they can increase FDI and receive taxes directly from owner wallets. Citizens in countries with bad players in leadership will be protected from corruption and land right grabs because everything can be verified on the blockchain. One of the key components of the project will be the creation of the community governance which ensures it remains decentralized and never in control of the big banks. All that seems ideal but how does this impact or improve decentraland? Well home owners can quickly establish themselves and their property on decentraland using our NFT. The dao and community can use fees to increase DAO funds and the practicality of the ecosytem overall. Larger properties will boost the sale of other digital assets like art and furniture to decorate the digital property. BlockChain Homes in collaboration with decentraland can create a seamless connection between the physical and web 3.0.


## Specification

The digitizing process will create thousands of jobs for independent contractors to go to the physical property and use our equipment to digitize the property. Our platform will list and verify ownership of the property and connect with different worlds like decentraland. Our dapp built ontop of the ethereum will include side chains and protocols like Graph to make it easy for people to extract data from the blockchain and assess property info plus value. When homeowners decide to list the property for sell our platform will make it accessible to a larger pool of buyers and offer a smart contract. Once the smart contract is executed the transaction will be listed on the blockchain, our public ledger and a local gov. registry. Our protocol expert Diogenes Caseras is creating a system that allows us to incorporate side chains while minimizing vulnerability.

[Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=782bbe80-9adf-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)

## Summary

The DAO needs a clear process for removing and adding DAO Committee members. This proposal is a Draft Proposal outlining such a process for community consideration.


## Abstract

The DAO needs to be able to add and remove committee members in a variety of situations:

*   When a committee member resigns
*   When the community wants to replace a committee member
*   When a committee member must be removed quickly in an emergency

There are also several needs that need to be balanced when making changes to the DAO Committee:

*   Decisions must be as decentralized as possible
    \-Only qualified and trustworthy candidates should be appointed to the committee
*   Committee members must be able to collaborate and work well together
    \-The committee must be able to act immediately in an emergency

Bearing in mind the situations and needs listed above, please review this draft proposal process for removing, sourcing, and appointing DAO Committee members.


## Motivation

**Currently**, the process for adding or removing a DAO Committee Member can only be triggered and/or canceled (within a 24 hour delay mechanism) by a Security Advisor Board (SAB) member. This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.

Adding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.

The following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.


## Specification

**Removing a committee member**

Each stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.

***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***

1.  **By the DAO Committee:**

*   Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)
*   After 24 hours, the committee member is removed
*   Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.
*   DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community

2.  **By the Security Advisory Board:**

*   The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon
    After 24 hours, the member is removed
*   3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window
*   In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member
*   Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member’s powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.
*   If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community

3.  **By the community by creating a proposal:**

*   The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:
    *   The name of the committee member to remove
    *   Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.
*   To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP.
*   The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.
*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.
*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.
    In the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.

1.  If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.
2.  If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.

**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**

*   In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed
*   The Committee member’s COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO’s behalf.
*   The Committee member’s address must be removed from the DAO’s multisig proxy.
*   The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications


## Conclusion

**Adding a committee member**

The process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.

***Open application period (2 weeks)***

Applications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:

1.  What is your full name?
2.  What is your primary wallet address?
3.  Why are you applying?
4.  What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?
5.  What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?
6.  Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?
7.  Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.
8.  Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.

***Committee Interviews (1 week)***

Given how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO’s trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process.

The existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.

***Final community vote (2 weeks)***

After the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.

I had this thought time ago that we should reward creators but I just commented in discord. Now @helpimstreaming arised the topic again on his tweet: https://twitter.com/helpimstreaming/status/1556057891286749185

So, we would give 1VP for each spent MANA publishing a wearable.

About the technical viability, consulting to HPrivakos, it seems ok:

*   TheGraph shows the creator and the fee spent on each wearable: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/decentraland/collections-matic-mainnet

## Description

Hello fellow Decentralanders! We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the sole desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland 's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!

TheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND! That’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now. All previous ""fight"" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland. Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future ""winky face"".

We believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!

Upon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 90%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new DAUs to DCL.
The 24k will spend as follows (over a 6 month period)

*   1.5k per month for marketing
*   2.5k per month for development


## Specification

Our developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND. To check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below)
(INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner (only once), wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click summon your chicken. Disclaimer: we have yet to add additional AI functionalities and coloring to the chicken, but will do so immediately following our first drop. The first drop will be a wearable in the form of a gold chain that enables your pet chicken to show up behind you once equipped on your avatar.)

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

Dungeons and Dragons is played worldwide by an enormous range of players and it is no less intriguing to watch others play as evidenced by
the great success of organizations such as Critical Role. We believe a good implementation of this concept has the power to introduce many new users to Decentraland!


## Grant size

60,000 USD

## Description

### Goal

The main goal in creating this game is to expand the user base of Decentraland and showcase it as a place to have fun! Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players and thus, for an ordinary user Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from you - but it is and can be much more than that!

### Original proposal

https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-bafkrei-dungeons-and-dragons-decentraland/13138

### TL;DR changes in resubmission

*   Renting land for a reduced price through [@dax](https://governance.decentraland.org/balance/?address=0x895be97bdb9f8a244c472b18ea96dee39ddf8fe5)
*   Updated budget focused towards achieving a concrete six month Roadmap
*   More details re: past team experiences in game and software development

We believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an
ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland.

The game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won’t be a copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics so that the game fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of roleplay experience

### Scope

The scope of this grant proposal is ~8 months, until about the end of March
2023\. In that time our goal is to release a game in several steps until we have,
by the end of this time, a fully working v1 of our game accessible to all
Decentraland users.

### Game mechanics

As we mentioned, we decided to build a roleplaying experience specific to
Decentraland. Some of those modifications are:

*   A session in D\&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.
*   An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.
*   Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating one themselves.


## Specification

### How we see the final result:

1.  Each player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters.
2.  Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items
    in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences.
3.  The characters find themselves in a situation where they need to solve a problem or
    receive a task from a non-player character in the story.

For example, a simple scenario might be that players start their journey in a
tavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf.

The main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions, such as: ""Inspect the tavern,"" or ""Approach the tavern and start talking to the quiet villager”

Some actions’ success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, to ""Sneak
attack the guard"" you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is a 10; you roll the dice, if you roll a ten or lower you miss, greater than 10 and you hit.

In total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game
ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players’ characters have died.

Due to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another
character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be
completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.

### Budget Breakdown

***Total: 60k***

***Team Salaries: 49k***

*   *15k SDK Dev*
*   *15k 3D Artists*
*   *8k  Game Designer*
*   *4k  Game Master*
*   *4k  2D Artist*
*   *3k  Sound Designer*

***Marketing: 6k***

***Servers and infrastructure: 3k***

***Land Rental for 6 months: 2k***

### Tech Stack

Much of the game will be built using the Decentraland SDK but part of the infrastructure will be external. For this we will use a custom built backend server to store player scores, preferences, gaming history, and more.

### Revenue plan / Sustainability

While we do plan to create some wearables and possibly make some purchases available, adding a large number of profit-making functions will greatly burden the project, and making a profit is not our goal.

15760,15760,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Grant beneficiaries should be validated as real persons before submitting a grant request,"> by 0x6cd7694d30c10bdab1e644fc1964043a95ceea5f (Byte#ea5f)

### Motivation

Currently, the DAO provides grants to projects that add value to Decentraland but there is no way to verify that there is actually a person involved in the request. Sometimes there are legal implications in projects related to grants (contracts, terms, etc.), so it would be desirable to have some degree of certainty that there is a real person behind it.

To be clear, a grant for up to 240k USD can be provided and there is no proof of who got it.

### Proposed solution

Before applying for a grant, the beneficiary must validate himself/herself as a person. ""How"" is open for discussion - my suggestion would be to use [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) since it is a crypto-native validation, but it could be some sort of KYC or any other way to accomplish this.

### Implementation

The DAO should add a validation method when submitting a grant request to verify that the beneficiary is a real person. This way, grant requests that are available for voting will be pre-validated. This should not affect active grants that have been enacted prior to this change, if implemented.

- Yes, implement a crypto-native validation method (i.e. PoH)
- Yes, implement a traditional validation method (Proof of ID or any other)
- No, do not validate beneficiaries
- Invalid question/options

## Abstract

At MetaPlay, we are creating the first intelligent & independent virtual companion. It was made possible by embedding an innovative state-of-the-art AI code within our first chicken NFTs.
The CryptoChicken plays and interacts with the owner as well as the environment, bridging the gap of static pets with limited functionality in the Metaverse.
Our team currently has a small staff of talented individuals with a variety of significant capabilities. Each member comes from multiple types of professional formations such as finance, web development, and business studies, besides having worked with multiple noteworthy businesses.
Our vision is to empower Decentraland's community with smart and interactive pets that have yet to tread on this land.

## Description

Hello fellow Decentralanders!
We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the sole desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole.
Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective.
(For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!)
With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland 's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough.
Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!

TheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions.
In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it.
As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND!
That’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now.
All previous ""fight"" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland.
Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) in Decentraland a real possibility in the near future *winky face*.

We believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL.
While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest.
Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!

We have broken down the estimated costs that we have calculated to ensure a smooth progress of our vision… Upon being approved for the funding we have asked for in this proposal we intend on: reimbursing our team for all out of pocket expenses ($10k), purchasing land for the project ($65k for an estate), launching a full scale marketing campaign (30k), and provide a full time income for all members of MetaPlay so that we may continue to innovate and shatter the current limitations of the platform ($4k per month for 5 members for 5 months = $100k). The remaining $35k that we are requesting will be used to hire on additional design and development support staff so that we can ensure that all promised content will be delivered in a timely manner.


## Specification

Our developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries.
Our designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D.
Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner.
Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can claim and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND.
To check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below)

(INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner (only once), wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click summon your chicken. Disclaimer: we are aware that currently there is a  bug that causes multiple chickens to be summoned if you click the box multiple times, causing them to fuze into one 'mutant' chicken, We assure you that this is only the beta test and that our devs will have the issue corrected shortly.

## Beneficiary address

0x7c36451CE229c63db435D63967C27F9823769475

## Description

The market is on the rise and along with it, many people are taking advantage of selling easily without work.
People are entering the crypto market with false promises and illusions and they suffer when they lose money, either because of lack of education, too much greed, or being deceived by scams.
We want to be able to deliver content that teaches them how to protect themselves , how to play on metaverse, how to buy and sell stuff, etc.
I believe that NFT games and Metaverse are THE GATEWAY for millions of people in the crypto world and I want to bring the knowledge they need to get in and stay, keep investing and earning money to help their families.


## Specification

I want to:

*   Grow my community
*   Educate new people who are coming to the crypto world
*   Bring news about Mana

This helps the entire Metaverse ecosystem, which is just in its infancy.
It will be a 3 months project using my 3 channels:

Website: https://fitpro.games
Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fitprogames
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUOdzVdurg0q72Yy7nMNMQ


## Personnel

My first investment in this universe was in a NFT.
I'm with it to this day and I intend to keep it  for a long time, because I know the power of education, community and business creation around Web 3.0 and Meetaverse.
And I want to teach that to Brazilians.


## Roadmap and milestones

It will be a 3 months project:

Month 1, 2 and 3
Content generation to posts, videos, news and articles

*   2 posts per week on instagram about MANA
*   1-2 articles per week for the blog/site or translation of the main news and articles of the Official website
*   2 videos per week on YouTube about MANA and Metaverse with the goal of connecting and educating the community so they can better understand and interact with Decentraland.

### Summary

Raise the voting period time and voting power threshold to pass grants of Tiers 4, 5 and 6.

### Abstract

At the beginning of the Grant Community Framework [a minimum VP participation threshold was set](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=95141550-c3f4-11eb-b2bc-870b0f8c50b5). At the moment current thresholds are 1M VP for Grants for all grants.

Recently [a proposal to expand the Community Grant Program 1 has been approved](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c02ff450-2783-11ec-ac84-77607720a240), adding three new tiers that enable access to higher amounts of funding:

*   Tier 4: Up to $60.000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff).
*   Tier 5: Up to $120.000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff).
*   Tier 6: Up to $240.000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff).

This proposal aims to set new VP thresholds for Tiers 4, 5, and 6 but also give time to the community to reach that goal.

### Motivation

The VP thresholds are an important mechanism set in place with the purpose of:

*   Ensures that enacted proposals more accurately reflect the sentiment of the greater community.
*   Helps to prevent the DAO from funding underqualified, poorly-formulated, or fraudulent grants.

### Specification

General considerations:

*   Past grants received between 1M and 2.3M VP each.
*   Maximum VP received in a proposal 11M VP.
*   Participation of VP may change over time.

New thresholds for  Tiers 4, 5 and 6:

*   2M VP ⇒ Tier 4: Up to $60.000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff).
*   4M VP ⇒ Tier 5: Up to $120.000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff).
*   8M VP ⇒ Tier 6: Up to $240.000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff).

**New votation period for Tiers 4, 5, and 6: Two weeks.**

15767,15767,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should players own the copyright on Decentraland screenshots they make?,"> by 0xcf10cd8b5dc2323b1eb6de6164647756bad4de4d (Eibriel)

Every time you take a screenshot of a game, software or web site you don't really own that picture. The same happens with screenshots and video captures made to the Decentraland client.

Should the Decentraland Foundation modify the Terms of Use and Content Policy in such a way to automatically grant copyright over screenshots and video captures of the client, for any use and forever?

That should include screenshots of:

*   Default avatars, default wearables / thumbnails
*   Common places such as streets and plazas
*   Music and sound
*   UI elements
*   Empty land / the skybox
*   Builder elements
*   And probably more

That, of course, doesn't mean that the user will own the 100% of the screenshot, since it could include third party intellectual property, such as wearables and buildings. And must ask for permission to use them when appropriate.

This change will allow content creators , artists creating derivative art (virtual photography, filmmaking) have more right over their work. And will not require them to ask Decentraland Foundation for a release for each piece of work.

Note: A recent incident I had where I was unable to make use of a Decentraland screenshot due to copyright issues prompted me to make this proposal. I'm not a legal expert, so I may be wrong on many details. In USA exists ""fair use"", but it only works there and not in the rest of the world.

due to the massive increase in interest, the price of mana has increased to the point where if someone new wants to create a wearable it will cost them $2500~. This is limiting the amount of creativity that is possible within dcl. So I propose that the cost to mint is reduced is lowered to 50 mana but will scale as follows: 2nd mint 100 mana, 3rd mint 250 mana, 4th mint 500 mana at which it will be capped. This should help to kick start smaller creators and will mean that only the most creative/entertaining creators become successful. Doing this Should overall create a profit for the DAO as although the price is cheaper it will encourage more people to get creating

There are currently points of interest that are emboldened on the map with a noticeable star. This is a poll to determine whether or not it would be beneficial to have the ability to mark (with a thumbtack or location pin) additional favorite places on their individual map.
IE (x,y) Pinned to map with assigned name by player.
This will allow very efficient fast travel to locations instead of having to constantly be reminded of location coordinates.
There should still be designated POI's and they would maintain the same characteristics of being shared across the standard DCL map...however this proposal would allow a simple mark on the map per individual basis of the user.  (Create instanced maps with saved locations)

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

I am seeking funding for the development of a module that will facilitate the creation of parkour courses/mini-games in the SDK with minimal coding knowledge on the user's end. This module will be made available to the community to help build up the repository of functional examples and to act as a starting point for new developers while providing a useful scene that can be freely implemented into existing land.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003

## Description

Parkour is prevalent throughout internet and gaming culture. It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts, but currently most implementations require a fair understanding of how to program.

I hope to solve this through the development of a parkour creation kit that will allow users to easily setup parkour courses with a low knowledge requirement. The kit will offer a variety of features (different moving platform types/styles) that can be created by a user in a couple lines of code. Artistic users will find it simple to add more platform styles to the kit and advanced users can modify it to provide additional dynamic platform types.

We can reach a much wider audience by providing the advanced utility of the SDK without the requirement of programming knowledge. A module like this will create a great foundation for those looking to develop their own parkour tracks and foster Decentraland's parkour community! We can also continue to expand it by adding to its functionality over time, increasing the types of dynamic platforms and available styles.


## Specification

This module will allow users to setup a dynamic parkour course, including platforms with dynamic moving patterns and styles. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making the creation of courses significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default/demo scene itself will showcase all the features available in the module, providing an example implementation for each component.

The currently planned features are:
\-Static platforms: platforms that do not move.
\-Moving Platforms: platforms that move along a designated course of way-points (A to B to A, repeating)
\-Rotating Platforms: platforms that rotate along a given axis and at a given distance from the pivot point.
\-Blinking Platforms: platforms that periodically blink in and out of existence on a timed delay.
\-Platform Styles: ability to define and assign display styles to platforms, modifying their appearance in-game.


## Personnel

I'll be working on this project solo. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for a relatively short period of time I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.


## Roadmap and milestones

This project will be competed within 2 weeks of this proposal's acceptance. The basic roadmap is as follows:

\-Week 1: Implementation of core features, rough demo scene made available for feedback. -Week 2: Scene/code polish, implementation of suggested features within scope.

As with any project, there will likely be bugs/flaws in implementation. I'll be maintaining the main repo and will work towards fixing these as they get flagged.

## Description

As a community, we are entering an exploration phase to review
different adoption cases for this new consumption and communication
tendencies. In this context, the opportunity arises to adjust the balance
towards certain segments that, due to lack of proper channels, have
been exploited for the last few decades. We seek to promote an ethical
and conscious evolution of virtualization and decentralization.

The commercialization scheme linked to musical NFTs is in a
speculative stage. The real value that it offers for users turns out
to be quite confusing once we dig deeper and try to go beyond the
resale possibilities and the warranty that the image associated with
them provides.

We aim to develop an ecosystem that provides the stimulus of a
scalable and sustainable bond between creators and audiences
through their interaction in Decentraland. The social element will be
the engine that powers our marketplace, where exclusive content and
presentations of our curated catalog of creators will provide added
value to the participants. Also, each user will be able to manage a
crate or personalized library that will allow him or her to showcase
their assets in the platform as well as in our virtual district, promoting
a sense of owning a unique collection, user interaction and direct
financing from communities to creators.

Our multidisciplinary team is composed by professionals that specialize
in all key areas of the productive chain: from musicians to engineers,
producers, creatives, developers and a vast array of resources
and capacities joined together by the passion of linking music with
technology, as well as the desire to contribute to the development
of interactions and flow of energy in the shape of information that
Decentraland and the whole crypto ecosystem provides.

## Specification

BeatBlox Muisc District:

Our primary goal is to keep developing the possibilities offered by the
Metaverse, with our district in Decentraland being the main focus
of the BeatBlox expansion. We seek to develop an ecosystem that
allows artists to create additional revenue and distribution channels,
while enabling a more deep connection with their audiences. There,
users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual
concerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational
resources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.

BeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content
care in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork.
This is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the
interactive installations and NFT associated services. We are creating
strategic alliances with music and blockchain fields referents for the
development of user focused experiences and content. By doing this,
we aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use
of Decentraland.

Come and visit us at 40,44.

BeatBlox Marketplace and Academy:

By using Polygon and reducing minting costs significally,
we have succesfully implemented a NFTs sales and
distribution system that allows floor prices as low as USD 1.
We also gave birth to a concept in its entirety for our
Decentraland district.

In this opportunity, we are reaching out to the community
for helping us to strength the development, the promotion
and the scalability of an integral platform. This will add
value to users in the metaverse, while helping to reduce
adoption barriers for new participants

This platform will be leveraged by a marketplace with
expanded social functionalities, a curated catalog to
ensure high quality standards and an Academy to support
the adoption of new technologies linked to a further
democratized access for artists and users to the vast
opportunities that this technology provides.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Support royalties for Decentraland collections on secondary sales.


## Grant size

30,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xBCAc4dafB7e215f2F6cb3312aF6D5e4F9d9E7eDA

## Description

Based on the proposal passed [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b70c59d0-09c5-11ec-a4d1-8d5d2cba0825) + some free time I took the chance to upgrade the implementation of the Marketplace & Bid smart contracts to include royalties for collection creators/item beneficiaries. It is  **ONLY IN POLYGON** where UG collections are being created.

For the time being, royalties are going to be calculated following:

*   Each token is an item kind. You may know that each item can have a beneficiary which is used for primary sales. If the item has a beneficiary, the royalties will go to the item's beneficiary. If not.
*   Royalties will go to the collection creator.

The implementation of how the royalties receiver is calculated can be easily replaced by a new one. To understand how it can be done if you are tech, refer [here](https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace-contracts/blob/feat/marketplace-with-royalties/contracts/managers/RoyaltiesManager.sol)

The royalty will be 2.5%.

The smart contracts still support the current fee for the DAO but is going to be 0%. I decided to keep it if for some reason we need to have something like 1% for the DAO and 1.5% for creators.

The Grant amount can change. I've set a cap. I'm still waiting for the auditors' quote.


## Specification

The smart contracts are ready for being audited.

Both implementations are [here for the marketplace](https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace-contracts/pull/56) and [here for bids](https://github.com/decentraland/bid-contract/pull/2)

The plan is to start testing the smart contracts within the Decentraland Marketplace ASAP.  Once we can be sure that everything is working as expected and safe, launch it.


## Personnel

[@Nacho](https://github.com/nachomazzara): Decentraland Evangelist


## Roadmap and milestones

The roadmap for adding the royalties in the Decentraland Marketplace will be:

*   Audit the smart contracts
*   Deploy them in the Mumbai testnet.
*   Integrate the new smart contracts in the subgraphs & in the UI.
*   Deploy in Polygon.
*   Launch

Related to the topic for this Grant. The roadmap is just to pay for the audit of the smart contracts.

For integrating the smart contract in the Decentraland Marketplace I will require effort for the engineer team.

## Description

We are only 75 years away from the gas chambers and names like this have no place in this world we are trying to build with respect for each other. Decentralized is one thing,  deeply offensive on two levels is another

Vote for Approval of Cybermike&rsquo;s Wearable Character Build &ldquo;Idoru&rdquo; and listed on Layer 1 Ethereum as Bundle Set full character

Holders and investors are incentivised to display this asset in its best light and not in a way which devalues their investment asset with other non-fitting parts.
The character was built initially as one complete merged build on a single rig, after this would not fit on the current wearable format model I broke the character up into sections with each cut having equal weight per vertex, it fits and moves perfect together as was intended.

I was told to wait until the &ldquo;full suit&rdquo; option is available. Previously as advised - my character was broken up into sections to fit the wearable option limitations - lots of extra work has been done on these sections individually on their own rigs and to go back to a complete (merged) version would require a much older version of the character and too much extra work to get the build to its current form. The broken up parts had a lot of refinements done on them
The character is a little heavy and will only be in mythic category for a high price

I have done a lot of testing in Decentraland and everything works as it should - 4 are reserved and the owners will agree to not wear the suit more than 1 set per event and never combined with other wearables as they will not fit well and will clash with the style and theme, this theme is part of an even greater story and growing concept I wish to work on for many years into the future, I have pages of concept work and creative writing and sketches and many deep thoughts on the fantasy surrounding this, as well as years of my life in building out these scenes with a backlog of various 3d scenes I have built. I live to build and create

I'm a technical 3D Artist almost 20 years. https://youtu.be/TgXGq\_8esw0?t=188 my previous handle in Decentraland was ""Mike Dent"" have been building, investing, promoting Decentraland since end 2017 non stop

I work intense and prefer deep quality and passion over fast production/ promotion and fast sales. This is honest work

It was not meant to be combined with anything else but was only broken into sections as a compromise to work with the wearable tool. The pricing is high and quality is my best to date, I have spent many months intensively working on this master build which has my new branding for my best dark creative work  &ndash; &ldquo;Dark Horse Builds&rdquo; it is my type R badge.
I request this character to be listed as layer 1 on Ethereum and sold as bundle set only on opensea for Mana on the Ethereum network.

The above idea is similar to when one views the map in Sandbox. This way, buyers, users, investors can see at a first and quick glance of who are the high profile owners. Think Snoop Dogg, Atari, The Walking Dead on Sandbox. DCL has a number of high profile/famous investors like Samsung, JP Morgan, Sotheby, etc... would be good to have these highlighted as images on the map layout. Avatars can also visit interesting places (attracted by the images on the map) by just clicking on the estate/parcel in the map.

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

LendIT is a platform for the safe rent of NFT items without required collateral from the borrower’s side. The solution will expand limits for users, who can’t afford to acquire certain NFTs - with LendIT they’ll be able to borrow it for a set period of time.
The key feature of LendIT is an escrow wallet, that’s similar to Metamask, but includes some additional functionality. Borrowed NFT arrives in this wallet and the borrower can use it by logging into the game using the provided wallet. The NFT can not be moved from this wallet and automatically returns to the Lender’s wallet when the covered rent period is over. Borrowers can also send their own NFTs to the escrow wallet, so they can use all other collected NFTs with the borrowed one.

## Description

Even tho NFT is one of the hottest trends nowadays, our team has figured out that there is one important part of the whole system missing, which is the mechanism of NFT lending. Let\`s imagine a situation, where an average gamer wants to purchase a certain item in the videogame, a conditional sword, to deal tons of damage to his enemies, but it is too expensive for him. In this case, only his wallet will take a lot of damage. Fortunately, the MeGaDev team sees a solution. In our opinion, the player would be happy to rent this item, so they can feel all of its properties and enjoy the gameplay.

15792,15792,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should Fabeeo Breen be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?,"> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)

### Description

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The Candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, Fabeeo Breen (<https://www.fabeeobreen.com/>), 3D Artist and Independent wearable creator was nominated:

<https://market.decentraland.org/accounts/0x1dec5f50cb1467f505bb3ddfd408805114406b10?assetType=item&section=wearables>

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.  This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

Right now LAND is valued with 1000VP , which compared with LAND sales, the proportion is quite distant to the voting power of MANA.

The proposed idea is to implement voting system where we get the vote percentage separately and sum and divide so that MANA and LAND have both the same voting power.

For example, imagine following votes:

*   LAND: yes 40% no 60%
*   MANA: yes 50% no 50%
*   Result: yes (40+50)/2=45% no (60+50)/2=55%

Thoughts?
Is MANA more important than LAND for the wellbeing of the project?

- YES
- NO
- I like the proposal but not the 50%, LAND should have more weight
- I like the proposal but not the 50%, MANA should have more weight

I was hanging out on KandyGirl's twitch stream and he was sharing his new NFTs in the beginning of his stream and by the end of it, we were all sharing ideas together, bouncing off of him dropping knowledge on stream it was great. He shared his thoughts on Voting Power and earning a Point Of Interest. He also shared a proposal where there is a directory in places where you can search for a location and see locations categorized. For example we would have a Night Club section, Districts and Plazas, Casinos, Art Galleries etc.. We think this could help the user experience to help those who are confused and don't know where to go & help those who know where they want to go but can't find the coordinates or location on trending places/highlights. He did say it was okay for me to propose this idea. Please leave your feedback and thoughts below to help sharpen the idea.

## NFT Collections Description

We have created a collection of 5,000 NFT wearable sneakers across 40 different designs and rarity tiers, created in collaboration with 25 of the hottest web3 projects, including exclusive sneaker wearables created in partnership with Decentraland, Polygon and The Sneakerheadz Society.

These NFT wearables are the world's first Italian handmade leather phygital sneakers, which you can wear exploring Decentraland, or you can burn the NFT to redeem the identical physical pair of sneakers to wear in real-life.


## Items to be Uploaded

## Motivation

We are super hyped to bring our wearables to Decentraland!

We're excited to share our sneakers with the DCL community, and all the exceptional communities of the projects we've collaborated with to create NTR1-META's, so all can enjoy and wear our remarkable sneakers!

We moved into Crypto Valley 1.5 years ago, made ourselves at home, and put on some wild events for the community in TrustSwap HQ. We're now taking our involvement with the community to the next level by dropping these wearables!

NTR1-META sneakers are inspired by the magic of the chameleon. Our team admires the human ability to change in the face of adversity, much like how the Chameleon morphs the color of its skin cells to survive in the most challenging circumstances.

I love to go to the Events page to see what is happening now or soon, so that I can be there when the cool stuff happens. As it stands, there is a rotating banner of trending events (I like this) A static list of trending events (a bit redundant, but if kept to 6 or less doesn't bother me), then a bunch of events that started days or weeks ago, followed by events actually in progress or happening soon.

My problem lies with the events that are scheduled to last multiple days but really are only active for a few hours on the first day. Many times when I go to these events, the actual event is long over and no one is there. I think the event organizer should have to post a new event announcement for things that are multiple days or even if they run more than 3 hours. At the very least, I would be happy if there was a maximum time for an event of 24 hours. After that the announcement goes away. With something like a festival or long format event where there is activity for more than a few hours or even days, a new event announcement should be made for each segment of the event.

There is currently an event at the top of the list hat has been going on for 11 days. If you jump in to that parcel, there is nothing going on. Most events last 3 hours or less but the announcement may remain for weeks afterward.

Example image: https://imgur.com/a/9raRaFd

Should we continue to let event organizers hog the top slots of the Events page or should there be additional limits set to how long an event can be happening ""now""?

(side note: Also, the Events.decentraland.org page behaves differently from the in game version. It would be nice if the in game version was more like the .org version).

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Would like to create an NFT maze that is community orientated. Currently have over 20 unique mazes, that are designed to encourage user interaction. Idea is based on having users explore a maze, where they can also hang out in a lobby. The lobby will be hosted by companies, where those companies will be able to sell their real world services. Throughout the maze and lobbies, the user can place unique NFT art for consignment sales. Both the Lobby host (company) and NFT art sales would bring in overall revenue for decentraland, by using mana as main source of coin. Lobbies will encourage engagement and interaction. Will also have opportunity for a moderator host to have a booth and answer any maze or decentraland related questions.


## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xF5Ce5FF86220743c7b9Ed6F9b029237585D511B9

## Description

The mazes will solve the main problem of people not knowing where to go for help. The maze will be a game design to keep the user engaged and interactive, but will also be there to support the user with answers and guidance by moderators. All new moderators will be assigned different lobbies in different mazes and there can be an infinite number of moderators in any given maze.  Each maze will have keys and tokens to earn while solving puzzles to get to the finish. At any time the user can bounce into the lobby to talk about their progress with others, and/or interact with the business host, or a decentraland moderator. This grant will provide enough Mana to acquire land large enough to host an interactive maze with a few themed lobbies. Mana will also be offered to unique blockchain developers and engineers that believe in the project and want to contribute. Since every maze and lobby will allow users to post nft art on consignment, is imperative to have block chain engineers readily available to assist with troubleshooting any issues. Companies that want to be involved in the project will be required to pay a one time Mana fee, which will include a personalized lobby with brand awareness. They will also be able to sell or offer their product or service for the real world, while the user is in the decentraland lobby. Initial investment will be able to fund full time moderators to be available to walk the mazes and help other users by answering questions and encouraging lobby hang outs. The overall maze will have mana to earn as well as nfts that can be sold for mana.


## Specification

I will be the project manager and will be outsourcing the creation to skilled block chain engineers. I have drawn out mazes with different missions and designs, all geared to keep the user busy. At any time, the user can bounce into a lobby to meet the sponsored company and do business with that company (like purchasing insurance or real life product). At same time, user can invest in the lobby by posting unique art for consignment sale. NFT art will be able to be displayed throughout the entire maze, and a potential user can purchase NFT while in the maze and while playing the puzzle or game. This project will be completed by hiring qualified blockchain designer and engineer. This project was designed in my head over 20 years ago when I created these mazes with intention of creating a video game that can earn the user coin while playing. Now we have the technology to make this vision possible.


## Personnel

I currently hold a position with a fortune 100 company in their social media department. Once grant is afforded, I can approach my employer to invest in this space and make me Project Manager for them to start the first lobby.  The company I work for does a lot of commercial advertising and is an innovator in the tech space. Once my employer is in this space, they will be the pioneers and the proof of concept of more large companies to join the band wagon of creating lobbies in the decentraland maze. Then we will have a lobby where our brand will be posted everywhere, which will encourage other companies to jump on board and create their own.  Ideally, the user can go in the maze, and play, interact, and potentially buy things in the lobby, sign up for accounts, insurance, or whatever the lobby host business offers.


## Roadmap and milestones

Company sign up and assigned engineers will happen by August 2022. With first maze & lobby to be launched in time for December 2022.

Hello, fellow members of the DCL Community!

It does not seem the builder has support for NFTs being minted on Polygon. I think the current gas fees are a bit high for newcomers who might want to test waters and buy NFTs. I have gotten a lot of feedback where an NFT is $20 but the gas is like $70 or an art is near $200 and the gas fee suddenly is $150.
We have a lot of artists who would benefit from this feature.

say you're in the virtual world of Decentraland and you run across someone that has their top 5 or 3 main interest listed next to their name and can be changed periodically.. something so simple as "" Someone to talk to "" promoting mental health, or ""First person shooter"" .. allows us to interact with someone easier.. "" what first person shooters you play?"".. ""you need someone to talk to? whats going on?"" ... if there is an event you're attending that day, show it off in your avatar and see if theres anyone else attending the same event. So many ways to interact in an easier way.. I truly believe this idea has major upside and potential. From brands to really anything at all. endless probabilities.

15807,15807,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Adding Ramp Network as an additional on-ramp service provider,"> by 0xbec36da328823182350132e41099efc1bf1798d9

Should the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Add Ramp Network as an additional on-ramp option for the marketplace to let users purchase $MANA and $MATIC.\
https://ramp.network/

The simple integration of Ramp would increase geo-coverage, lower the transaction fees, raise the purchase limits, simplify KYC for users and decrease dependence on a single provider.


## Grant size

200 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x98DB3a41bF8bF4DeD2C92A84ec0705689DdEEF8B

## Description

50+ countries covered\
Users from an additional 50+ countries could easily purchase required assets on the spot. That’s a 150% increase in geo-coverage compared to the current one.\
https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/433-supported-countries-and-territories

Lower transaction fees\
Users could purchase $MANA and $MATIC at a much lower cost. Ramp charges 2.9% for card payments compared to the current provider’s 3.9-5.5% (depending on currency).\
https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/431-transaction-fees

Almost 4x higher limits\
Users could purchase 375% the amount of crypto through Ramp then the current provider. Monthly limits would increase from 20.000EUR to 75.000EUR.\
https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/441-kyc-limits

Simplified KYC\
With Ramp there’s no KYC required for <100EUR purchases, to make it easier for the community to purchase smaller amounts.
Ramp also has a large community of gamers thanks to its numerous partnerships with projects like Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms, Pegaxy and more - those users already went through KYC with Ramp and they wouldn’t have to do it again when they’re getting started on Decentraland.

Having options\
Giving the community the option to choose between providers without having to leave the marketplace.

Not having to rely on a single provider\
So many things can go wrong, every provider has some downtime every now and then - don’t leave your users hangin’ when they’re about to buy that NFT. Have at least a backfall option.

Happier users from 50+ more countries could get started more easily and at a lower cost, and spend more thanks to the additional on-ramp. Less downtime, delays and having the option to choose.

This would impact the whole community, especially those who are new to crypto and/or to $MANA and Polygon.


## Specification

Custom API keys for the integration will be provided by Ramp after the approval of this proposal. The DAO Committee should reach out to partner@ramp.network to receive them!

Suggested placement of Ramp:\
User’s account page > ‘BUY’ option next to $MATIC and $MANA balance, just like the current provider.


## Personnel

The simple API integration shouldn’t take longer than 20min - 2 hours. All technical details can be found in our docs at https://docs.ramp.network.


## Roadmap and milestones

Quick Due Diligence check and signing our general framework agreement will be required. After completing this step, member of Ramp's team will provide the custom API key.

We’re excited to support the community!

We noticed when skinning wearables that we don't have access to a joint without transforms such as the root node.

This change will allow Decentraland wearable creators to make geometry that follows the characters world space position without inheriting motion from the characters animation.

This will lead to more innovative and unique wearable designs.

Should we request to expose (add a joint) to the root node of the player rig for creators to have access to a non-transforming node?

Scammers are big problem. Many people loose their crypto assets (land,etc) because of them. Most often this occurs in the form of fraudulent links in private messages or in the DCL Discord channel that lead to fake collections on Opensea or an offer to verify the account and sign a fraudulent transaction.All this results in a negative experience related to Decentraland. My suggestion is that community will ask Decentraland DAO Committee, Security Advisory Board and developers to make actions that will reduce this. Maybe it will be the creation of specialized software or more active coverage of this issue(education) in the community.

Bug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to discover and disclose potential vulnerabilities in projects’ smart contracts and applications, thereby protecting projects and their users. For their good work, security researchers receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability, as determined by the project affected.

Why have a bug bounty program at all? In 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Web3 community over $238m, and bug bounties can prevent those hacks from happening. Bug bounty programs surface vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before they get exploited in malicious hacks that destroy projects and ruin reputations.

As member of the Security Advisory Board (SAB), we hereby request the DAO to approve and fund the bounty program and due to its nature and limited execution capabilities, delegate to the Decentraland Foundation the ability to respond to any vulnerability disclosed through the program. That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to do the triage and answer the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed. So basically when a payment has to happen due to a valid report under the program, the Decentralan Foundation will inform DAO with case #, the recipient wallet address and amount to be paid and also, shall contact  the SAB in order to fix the vulnerabilities disclosed.

The program is composed of different threat levels and topics:

**Smart Contracts**

High					**Up to USD 500 000**

Medium			                **Up to USD 20 000**

Low					        **USD 1 000**

**Websites and Applications**

Critical				        **USD 18 000**

High				       **USD 6 000**

Medium				       **USD 3 000**

Low					       **USD 1 000**

Payouts are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **MANA and USDT**, with a minimum of 20% to be done in USDT.

The program is not tied or attached to any third party but the Decentraland Foundation will use them and their expertise and platforms to help administrate the program. Therefore and after a deep initial analysis, the SAB has selected and recommend the Decentraland Foundation to start the bounty program using [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/).

The Decentraland bounty program can be found [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/decentraland/).

I believe an ""Add to Cart"" would incentivize buying multipl NFTs at a time.. I like to purchase more than one at a time and most of the time after i am finished buying one NFT, i tend to lose the last page i was on and have to go searching for it through DCL's marketplace. It would be cool if we could have it added to the cart & click on each wearable bringing us to Metamask to sign off for each one.

As a decentraland, there should be no boundary in languages

Now only alphabet can be supported in typing in DCL.

If more different kind of languages are supported, more people from non-alphabet language speaking countries will get in and easily getting used to DCL.

So, I suggest non-alphabet languages like Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc. should be supported in typing.

In order to place a wearable on land to display it, the land owners need to have the original 3d models and import those, but people should be able to display the NFT wearables they own as well.

I think there should be some sort of clothes hanger or stand available in the builder, for people to display the wearables they own on their land.

Degree believes in inspiring the confidence in everyone to move more – both in the physical and virtual worlds.

The brand is working with a panel of experts, all who are people with disibilities, to assess inclusivity, representation and equity in Decentraland and will use these findings to submit governance proposals to optimize the accessibility and representation of the platform, as well as grant applications to the Decentraland Foundation to fund the implementations. This could range from improving representation of movement in the avatar builder by including options like a prosthetic or a wheelchair, to optimizing screen readers and controllers on the platform so that the blind community and those with reduced mobility can move in this virtual world.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

We want to purchases land and build a 'meta cinema' where community members can attend and watch socially conscious programming (long and short form) curated by our Decentraland space called Imagination 9. Having worked at a major film studio in non-theatrical distribution, we know how to navigate the difficult and confusing world of licensing content for 'out of the box' screenings.


## Grant size

60,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x483c676E1edd6f10DbE33D9911c1481222d8b070

## Description

Our project will allow visitors of Decentraland to be entertained and educated through the films/series that will be shown in our environment, Imagination 9. Because we'll curate socially conscious films (which we've been doing for movie theaters for years) will allow a positive environment for community members.


## Specification

The overarching consideration here is content control. We will work with digital rights management developers to make sure all intellectual property is secure and properly distributed without stepping outside of the non-theatrical license.


## Personnel

Our team will consist of major Hollywood studio executives that have decades of experience distributing content legally and safely through various channels. Our technical team has worked in several metaverse projects and has developed software to help push content through the various channels.


## Roadmap and milestones

We have started the preliminary conversations with the major film studios to check the interest level of distributing their catalogs through Decentraland. We have assembled a technical team to start with the DRM (digital rights management) process, developers to help with the creation of the space and signed commitments with independent content creators to feature their content exclusively within our space.

We are predicting the space to be fully operational by the 1st quarter of 2023 with smaller rollouts of socially conscious content by the 3rd quarter 2022.

## NFT Collections Description

I have only made shoe collections on DCL. They are the representation of the holders physicals and 3d assets we have provided them.  The collections I have made for them, are for the collectors to sell or leverage to their communities. My concept is to collaborate with different communities and onboard them into DCL via their own NFTs.

This new ability DCL has offered brings alot more options to the table and our future with fashion in this space. I would love for example at first to be able to load a special 1/1 wearable attached to the 3d assets of the owners seen in z1nkxholderz. I think they would find that pretty nifty.

But in the near future when we do our clothing drops, this option in a generative collection would fit perfectly.


## Items to be Uploaded

1

## Intellectual Property

I would have to provide each person with their IP.
Only half of the 3d assets have been completed.
We are only a small team, not all things are completed but would love to see these owners have their own pairs in DCL. If you click on them you will see a few founders as owners and things that are also interested in their own collections in DCL and are working with us to create them as you may be able to see on our DCL page.


## Motivation

I want to have my wearables in DCL as this offers the perfect evolution to my journey and story. Briefly we create physical custom shoes for NFT collectors.
But as we want to dive into the digital realm, these digital items need utility.
Being able to be worn is exactly what a shoe known for. These things make sense to the outside world more so and help us onboard newer people to NFTs that at least can do something they understand. I believe in interoperability and we need to connect all scenes to each other. I spend more time in the PFP nft community spaces, and feel its out of touch with amazing places like DCL. So I want to bring them here.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Pawnfi is a Non-Standard Asset platform that supports all the user to put their ERC-20 tokens or NFTs (721/1155) in work. That is, Pawnfi enables NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.

By supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, Pawnfi will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just ""buy and sell"" - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that.


## Grant size

30,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

## Description

Currently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow.

For this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi supports users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.

However, Pawnfi understands that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre

### Pawnshop:

Borrower:

In this Pawnshop, Pawnfi supports players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a ""Loan + Sale"" together.

Lender:

When visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.

### Rental Centre

Builders:

Instead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.

Renters:

Given that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.

In conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.


## Specification

Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help Pawnfi devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what Pawnfi plan to enhance and improve:

**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we’ll hire UI Designer to help to build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place and make the UX more immersive.

**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understands that it is not user-friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It’s vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.

**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre. While Pawnfi will normally charge service fee for placing rentals, for DCL creators we will provide rebate, which means contributing our service revenue to DCL community.

### Remove ""decentraland.org.cn"" from the DAO list of Catalysts

### Abstract :

The ""decentraland.org.cn"" node has not been upgraded since several months. According to https://catalyst-monitor.now.sh/, it is running the version #a7888ea, from beginning of April 2021, almost 2 months old.

### Motivation :

Catalyst nodes that are out of date or do not respond might pose security risks to any user of Decentraland that uses this node to download information. We should keep the list clean of servers that do not update frequently.

Since that catalyst was last updated, serious protocol updates have been deployed by the other catalysts and having a catalyst lacking behind by that much is a real issue to implement new features and optimizations.

The owner of this catalyst doesn't communicate with the rest of the catalyst owners so coordination is not possible, they are also not technical enough to host a stable catalyst and hasn't installed the necessary tools (which expose metrics of the catalyst, for example) to ensure the stability of the network.

Other catalysts are unable to pull any content from it, causing synchronization issues, frequent forks and issues for users to deploy content (as scenes are deployed to a random catalyst of the DAO approved list).

### Choices:

**For**: Removing ""decentraland.org.cn"" from the DAO Catalyst List

**Against**: Keeping ""decentraland.org.cn"" in the DAO Catalyst List

- For
- Against

The original purpose of the 500k vp count for a POI proposal to get implemented was to limit the number of POI's on the map, because a map that's too cluttered is not useful.

Now the only projects who get POI's are ones backed by whales.  This isn't consistent with the supposed ethos of DCL, and it's not limiting the # of POI's.

I propose putting a hard cap on POI's, and make them into NFT's so they are tradable on OpenSea and other marketplaces.

Another option would be to make them rentable like land, which might be more attractive in the long run.

Full disclosure:  I was one of the last to get one before the 500k cutoff.

## Description

Children aged 4-8 years old spend an average of 10 hours sleeping, 8 hours a day in learning, 3 hours in entertainment and only 2 hours in physical activity.

We are combining learning, entertainment & physical activity into AR education mini games to help children grow smarter, stronger and more mindful.

SuperKidz is the world’s first Move-to-Earn and Learn-to-Earn NFT game which makes it fun and rewarding for kids to learn, get active and become more mindful.  Built on (TBD) Solana/Avalanche/Ethereum, SuperKidz integrates your kid’s daily activity in real life with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so you can turn your kid’s real-life actions into expansive gameplay and earn crypto while doing it.

We started our research 2 years ago when iPhone 11 demonstrated realtime body tracing and 3D avatar rendering in real time. We developed our proof of concept in Unity 2019 and noticed several challenges in terms of user experience and performance.

We tested our prototype at home with our kids and found that VR was too dangerous for kids because they kept bumping into things. Any external hardware was also a challenge because parents weren't willing to buy or setup. We found that the TV in the living room provided the best user experience.

It was very intuitive for kids to mirror their smartphone or tablet to the TV however everything was inverted. We solved this problem by developing a ""mirrored"" AR game environment in Unity 2020. We spend 3 more months launching our demo app on the app store. After alpha users feedback and several iterations, our MVP is available on the app store at below link.

https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/superkidz-education-mini-games/id1613737876?l=en

We learnt from children that they learn better when they play with others. We are designing 8000 baby ape 3D ERC721A NFT avatars to keep kids company in the metaverse. Children will access the games with baby ape avatar. Kids avatars will help them learn by mimicking kids' physical movement in the metaverse to solve maths and english puzzles. Parents who buy these BabyApes can get lifetime membership of the game for their kids.

SuperKidz mixed / augmented reality mini education games accessible via 3D baby ape character NFT that becomes a kid's avatar in the game or kids can play in the free mode and accumulate enough SuperPowers to evolve the BabyApes and then these SuperPowers are minted as NFT accessories.  We are the first mass market NFT game targeting kids aged 4-8 years old.  We want to educate kids how to navigate through Web3 and incentivise them for learning, exercising and enhancing their emotional intelligence while having fun.

Kids avatars would gain different superpowers by solving puzzles. Kids then could trade these superpowers to teach other kids. Baby apes can also earn the SUPA coins with their superpowers and use these coins to buy accessories like hats, bags, sunglasses etc and can trade them with other kids.

SuperKidz combines the nurture and evolution of Tamagotchi, the crafting and collecting of Animal Crossing, the training and battling of Pokemon Go, while rewarding players with crypto as they go through our carefully curated positive content.  Besides, there is no additional equipment to be purchased.  Players just need a mobile phone, and better if they have newer phones and a smart TV.

We are the first mass market NFT game targeting kids aged 4-8 years old.  We want to educate kids how to navigate through Web3 and incentivise them for learning, exercising and enhancing their emotional intelligence while having fun.

Kids avatars would gain different superpowers by solving puzzles. Kids then could trade these superpowers to teach other kids. Baby apes can also earn the SUPA coins with their superpowers and use these coins to buy accessories like hats, bags, sunglasses etc and can trade them with other kids.

SuperKidz combines the nurture and evolution of Tamagotchi, the crafting and collecting of Animal Crossing, the training and battling of Pokemon Go, while rewarding players with crypto as they go through our carefully curated positive content.  Besides, there is no additional equipment to be purchased.  Players just need a mobile phone, and better if they have newer phones and a smart TV.

## Roadmap and milestones

Conception \[January 2021] - Project was conceived due to COVID frustration when our daughter had to spend a lot of time studying on an iPad and got sick due to lack of physical activity.

Demo Launch \[Sep 2021] - We launched an alpha iOS demo app that demonstrated full-body tracking and 3D avatar rendering in real-time. The demo was well received by alpha users

MVP Launch \[May 2022] - Developed (patent pending) mechanism to match the body shape to English alphabets and is used in the spelling game similar to Wordle. Kids would spell 5 new words each day, dancing to the beat to shape their bodies to alphabets of the worlds in sequence.

Strategic Partnership \[July 2022] - We have signed a strategic partnership with one of Asia’s biggest direct selling companies with over 25 million customers. Our terms include a USD1 million investment to build the first version of the maths and English games targeting 4-8 years old children.

15839,15839,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Add Malloy to the Wearables Curation Committee,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Summary**

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The [Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/) was formed to help with this process.

There are currently only three individuals sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the [call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047),  Malloy was nominated:

""Malloy is one half of https://www.feekagames.com/ A professional 3D artist since the age of 18, Malloy originally worked for the HSN US Television shopping channel creating 3D product animations and renders in C4D. After working for 6 months in advertising, Malloy went to university where they received a BA degree in Computer Game Arts.

During their time at university, Malloy worked on various titles, and interned for several game studios in the Guildford, UK, area. Examples include Born Ready Games, Edge Case Games, Atom Republic, and Echo Peak. After graduating, Malloy worked for various studios, helping to launch titles for the Xbox One and Playstation 4.

After 8 years of working in the gaming industry, Malloy transitioned to full-time independent work alongside a friend from university. Together, they’ve since provided 6 years worth of work to Atom Republic with Atom Universe content, in addition to working with many other indie studios from around the world. They’ve also recently developed their own mobile game “Patty Stack’, which launched in March of 2021.

Malloy discovered Decentraland about 6 months ago shortly before the launch of the L2 wearables editor. Malloy thoroughly enjoys the wearables creation process, and has worked with several parties within Decentraland’s community, including the Foundation, to help provide 3D content.""

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the [DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b) to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

**Should Malloy  be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?**

I created this collection: https://forum.decentraland.org/t/collection-black-lives-matter-2021-created-by-lefty-is-ready-for-review/1338

I created it because I thought it was cool, I didn't know there were grants available, and I had never published wearables before so I didn't really know what to expect.

I didn't even consider that people would be thinking about me making money.

However, some of the community members voiced their unfavorable opinions so the admins and I have decided to leave it up to the community to decide if these wearable should be approved or not.

- Approve This Collection

## Beneficiary address

0x295302cE6b8f817691Bfd3CfF0e1b6632FDB54c6

## Description

Hello,
today I would like to present to you a project that we are developing with friends, MetaSlip, it is a project where we will have to mint one or more NFTs to be able to ask to receive your underwear for free ( 1 every 6 months approximately).
To be able to launch our project, we need to recruit a WEB3 developer for the management of smart contracts. We already have some mockup for the nfts and a pretty well established roadmap.
Note that NFT holders will be able to claim tokens every week! ($ MSP) on a value of 1.2 per NFT owned!

I am therefore asking for your help to finance the project and finally launch what we have wanted to do for a long time !!

Why not adapt our nft to a metaverse game afterwards!

Thanks again for reading!


## Specification

We would be on a long-term vision, that is to say that our nft will provide you with free underwear for life (around 2 per year per nft) all thanks to the nft owning!
The token gain will be there to reward our nft holders and give you access to votes for future partners or for the next event.
All we need is the development of smart contracts and an integration on a website (almost entirely done).
The more you hold, the more your opinion will have an impact on the future of the project! We are counting on you and your support!


## Personnel

There are 3 of us on the project and we know that having to change our underwear is a really nasty task! the price may vary and you will waste part of your budget for future vacations! Thanks to our project, you would only need to invest once to hold a nft and request your underwear for free (shipping costs offered anywhere in the world).


## Roadmap and milestones

MetaSlip is still too young to be able to guarantee flawless success, but with your support we could finally launch the nft mint by Q1 2022 and deliver your first reward tokens around Q2-Q3 2022.

The request to send your underwear will be in 2023 according to the affiliate partners!
we hope we can get into gaming projects and drop our underwear there all over the metaverse. If there is mass adoption we should be able to do that by Q2 2023 - Q1 2024.

The project is certainly for the long term but think about your underwear that you will have to buy back during its years! MetaSlip can fix this!

15846,15846,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Do you think users should be able to edit their claimed names in builder?,"> by 0x9161d8a046136c6cecbbd24fe71d12922e8606fe (Minted)

I am writing this proposal to address the issue with claimed names with poor character usage. Names are unique NFTs in Decentraland and allow users to identify themselves in the metaverse.

As you know when users claim a name via the builder for 100 Mana (+Gas) that it is a one time transaction and cannot be edited or customised after.

Names can have letters and numbers as well as the option to use upper and lower case characters. I have noticed users will claim a name and not consider the lower and uppercase characters when minting their NFT.

This is not an issue as some users are allowed to to use lower and upper case characters in a variety of ways and combinations that they prefer. However, when users are buying claimed names from Decentraland Marketplace or secondary marketplaces like Opensea then they might find a name they want but the characterisation is messy and not clean. Some users may prefer a capital first letter on a name  or just an option to edit it how they want whereas some names have been claimed and minted in all lowercase (Example would be ""genisis plaza"" and ""Genisis Plaza"".

I wanted to ask the community whether they think it would be beneficial to add a feature in builder where users who have claimed names can edit the capitalisation of letters (Upper and Lowercase). NOTE users will not be able to change the names letters and numbers or format (Order).

As a user of decentraland that has invested in name NFTs I think this would be good for those who cant claim a desired name but would like to buy a name and would still be able to edit it to their preference.

Vote in the poll below and if you have any suggestions then feel free to contact me.

- Yes
- No

## Abstract

Rather than see the Metaverse space dominated by one large corporation, it would be much more interesting to see a group of already successful virtual worlds join together to form a system-of-systems, a mini Metaverse. After the initial pioneering work, virtual worlds can be added to the system-of-systems, ever increasing the size of the would-be Metaverse. Several prototypes have already been created integrating disparate systems using IPSME. This proposal would enable the pioneering work to integrate Decentraland with other platforms, **without** requiring massive re-engineering efforts from Decentraland. IPSME does not require Decentraland to conform to a third-party protocol or SDK; IPSME uses Decentraland's existing infrastructure.

## Description

This proposal would enable the pioneering work to integrate Decentraland with 4 other systems. Rather than incur large re-engineering costs to have Decentraland conform to a particular Metaverse protocol, the integrations with the other systems will be created external to Decentraland's implementation via IPSME. This is contrary to the often peddled approach which requires integrated systems to adhere to and implement a particular protocol or SDK. When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space. Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4.

Decentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services.

By integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well. The entire integrated system-of-systems can develop organically.


## Specification

The specification for IPSME is here: https://doi.org/10.1145/3458307.3460966

And a simple video introduction can be found here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvoeUydcInA\&list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\&index=1

Over the last 4 years, IPSME has been tested in several prototypes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK

And, the integration of 123 third-party Minecraft servers: https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/mim-web-of-interconnected-block-worlds/

### IPSME:

*   Doesn't avoid standards, but avoids the ***need*** for standards
*   translations are external to the systems being integrated
*   reduced costs: rather than bring down and re-engineer the system to adhere to a standard, external translations are dynamically updated instead
*   reduced complexity: translations can be used transitivity, reducing complexity from exponential to linear
*   each world gets to choose what they share by exposing APIs on their existing infrastructure
*   ability to dynamically query the network for new services


## Personnel

The aim of this proposal is a 6 to 12 month project. I've been working on interoperability since 1998.

## Roadmap and milestones

Due to the created prototypes, lots of code has already been written for the IPSME components. After the rudimentary infrastructure is ready, integration will start with two virtual worlds. If this proposal is granted, Decentraland will be the first to be integrated. Thereafter, the other integrations will be made until all virtual worlds form the system-of-systems.

As visible on my YouTube channel, I regularly release videos on the progress of my work. This grant is not for a prototype, but for releases. Also, if all goes well, the Decentraland community should be able to enjoy extra functionality (towards the end of the project).

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

I am seeking funding for the development of an easy-to-use module that will allow users to display their NFTs in a gallery format with minimal setup (simply adding their NFT details to a single file). This module will be made available to the community to help build up the repository of functional examples to act as a starting point for new developers and provide a useful scene that can be freely implemented into existing land.


## Grant size

2,500 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003

## Description

Standard users within Decentraland (DCL) have quite a few resources on-hand to build a display to show off their NFTs, but all of them require a fair bit of work to. Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.

What I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space. We can also provide users who lack an understanding of programming solutions that would otherwise be unavailable to them.


## Specification

This module will allow users to display their art by interacting with a single well-documented file. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making management of their content significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.

The completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land). I believe that enabling users to not only create but also share their content easily will be key to building up this platform.


## Personnel

I'll be working on this project solo, again :). I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.

Previous projects include:
\-[Minesweeper](https://decentraland-minesweeper-showcase.vercel.app/?position=0%2C0)
\-[Networked Checkers](https://decentraland-checkers-showcase.vercel.app/?position=0%2C0)


## Roadmap and milestones

This project will be competed within 2 weeks of this proposal's acceptance. The basic roadmap is as follows:

\-Week 1: Implementation of core features, rough demo scene made available for feedback.
\-Week 2: Scene/code polish, implementation of suggested features within scope.

As with any project, there will likely be bugs/flaws in implementation. I'll be maintaining the main repo and will work towards fixing these as they get flagged.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

I am requesting a grant to start a free to play casino in Decentral land.  The proceeds will be used to buy a land an open up a free to play casino.  All guest will receive a set amount of tokens for playing once those tokens are exhausted they will then be offered the opportunity to buy additional tokens.  I have been on the casino and online space for over 20 years my goal is to have a place where we can have fun. The games would include poker, slot machines, black Jack, Baccarat, roulette, and much more.


## Grant size

50,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x852f2403df9bfae4bb76ab0196cd284250344aa0

## Description

I want to bring a social and fun casino I believe brining in casino as a general term will just be a way for people to loose money and not have a great experience.  Through my experience we can program the games to give people a fare shake and not just take peoples money.  This will be a fun social event and have things like bingo and poker that are communal games that will bring a sense of community.

The money will be used to
\-Purchase good land
\-Build the games in Unity

*   Market
*   Build sales funnels to get people to come back into the casino
*   Staff to man the casino
*   continual development

Any and all money received will be put back into the casino, once the casino is profitable we would like at tokenization and NFt's for the space.


## Specification

As CTO I would bring on contract workers to code and build the casino to specification. All code will be based on Unity and GIT Hub for the integration. I have many developers in the casino space with poker and slot games already developed.  This will save me thousands on leveraging these relationships for these items.


## Personnel

Adam Lopez- Technical CTO I have been working in the technical space primarily around casino's for the last 20 years. I have brought to market key companies such as Bally Technologies, SciGames, GAN, and a few others.

Scott Long - CFO will handle all the finances to ensure budget is kept

David Owens - Key Casino consultant working in the casino for the last 20 years his expertise in table games and table games management.

iTechArt Group- Will be the technical arm - They have worked with several fortune 100 companies. They have contractors out of Eastern Europe with experience in integration and game content.


## Roadmap and milestones

The road map will be

*   Creating our own coin - This will be used in decentral land to gamble and give out to potential customers

*   Live Bingo nights

\-live poker tournaments

*   Live slot machine tournaments

*   Celebrity endorsements

*   The ability to sit at a slot machine and actually gamble

*   Major contributors like IGT (wheel of fortune) ATI (Buffallo) and many more

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

‘Filmrare’ is a Travelling Cinematheque that can host Film Screenings, Archive films & film-related artifacts. The aim of this space is to build a communal experience around cinema by encouraging diverse voices to exhibit their films and enabling different audiences to engage with filmmakers, Films & Film History.

The Cinematheque will host independent films across Art House, Genre Cinema & Diverse Upcoming Voices.  The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.

The Grant will be used to rent land & pay screening fees to the filmmakers.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f

## Description

‘Filmrare’ will be a cultural destination in Decentraland with daily screenings & conversations around Cinema. While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q\&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations.
The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.

The pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day.  We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.

The grant money will be used to rent a parcel for 6 months. We intend to rent a 100 MANA parcel with a deposit of 200 MANA. The remaining amount of close to $2000 will be used to incentivize filmmakers for giving us the rights to screen their films.


## Specification

The cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first. A demo can be seen here -> https://youtu.be/AtczYVUIoLU

The building is being built using Blender 3D models and the DCL SDK. We also have a screening site https://filmrare.com where we have used ERC-1155 tokens to provide access to content. We intend to use the same technology here for ticketed events where the token holders would be allowed to watch screenings.


## Personnel

The team consists of the below three members who bring engineering, creativity, and industry experience.

Ravi Krishnan, Founder of Filmrare ->https://www.linkedin.com/in/krcnow/

Mathivanan Rajendran, Program Director at Root.ax -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathivananr/

Arun Karthick BAFTA Breakthrough director -> https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/breakthrough/arun-karthick-directorwriter


## Roadmap and milestones

The roadmap for the project is as below

January - Parcel acquisition and scene deployment. Testing with BETA users for the multiplayer experience, live streaming, and ERC-1155 based ticketing.

February - Public domain movie screenings by creating events in DCL. Pitching to filmmakers and lining up the editorial. Pitching to film festivals. Early testing of screening plus socializing.

March - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam).  This would be accompanied by other films.

April-June - Conducting events at scale with month-long programming.

15855,15855,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,[DRAFT PROPOSAL] Decentraland Olympus Pro Partnership,"> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)

*This proposal was drafted by the Olympus DAO Partnership Team in coordination with the Decentraland DAO Facilitator. The DAO facilitator’s support in the drafting of the proposal is not an endorsement. This is a Draft Proposal, and will require 2M Votes to be promoted to the final voting stage.*

**Summary:**

We are proposing that Decentraland DAO participate in the Olympus Pro program. Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.

**Abstract:**

Olympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs while offering users discounted tokens in return. At the time of writing, Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity.

**What are the protocol benefits of this new bonding mechanism?**

For the protocols there are a number of benefits. One of the primary benefits is creating a new revenue stream for the DAO. By owning the liquidity, the DAO will start to capture the trading fees. At the time of this writing the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.

Additionally, since there is no longer a need for extreme inflationary token incentives MANA will have a protected liquidity floor. This helps to protect from illiquid markets and creates a better trading experience for token-holders due to minimal slippage.

Finally, the Olympus Pro program helps Decentraland gain exposure to the Olympus community! Decentraland and Olympus are two of the biggest communities in the Metaverse and DeFi industry. We believe it would be the perfect partnership to broaden both communities and to create a truly powerful decentralized ecosystem for both Olympus and Decentraland.

**Motivation:**

*What are the benefits for the community?*
Gives the community the opportunity to buy discounted (~5-10%) tokens in exchange for providing the protocol a liquidity position. This provides a truly positive sum interaction between the protocol and community. In typical liquidity mining the protocol pays out their token for individuals/entities to temporarily provide liquidity. With Olympus Pro the Decentraland still pays out it’s token but receives an LP/asset in return. A win-win for both parties!

Additionally, the community will not have to suffer through impermanent loss. Impermanent loss describes the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair. With Olympus Pro they simply provide an LP position to the protocol and receive MANA in return! The MANA is linearly vested over a typical time period of 7 days - meaning the discounted MANA accrues over a 7 day period, and can be used freely at the end of this period.

*How can it help Decentraland?*
Controlling Decentraland’s own liquidity will support sustainable growth and can create new revenue streams for opening reward emissions for its users.
Increased revenue streams for the further development of the protocol. For example, on December 6, trading fees on X for the ETH-MANA LP pair were $12,060 USD. If Decentraland owned the liquidity for this pair, these fees would go to the DAO treasury.\
Removes the need to create high inflationary rewards for liquidity mining
Allowing multiple bond pairs with MANA (reserve or LP) would diversify your treasury, thus allowing for more complex DeFi strategies to create sustainable growth that is essential for these protocols to keep incentivizing users to play the game
Controlling your own liquidity decreases your dependency toward financial backing (VCs, private investors, etc) and gives more power to the DAO and its community

## NFT Collections Description

### neuCard

neuCard was the first drop created by us. It has been minted 517 times and every holder will have priority access to fashion drops organized by us over others. Card has been split into 2 rarities, where legendary version will always have slightly better priority access to the drops. In the future linked wearables will be linked to neuCard making holders automatically obtain the wearables.

### The Diesel x neuno Alpha Drop

This was a digital representation of Diesel Prototype Sneakers. It was dealt through private free mint which only a selected group could mint. One of the groups were neuCard and Diesel D-verse NFT holders. It was minted 1122 times and holders are going to get Diesel Prototype Sneakers linked wearable.

## Motivation

Project neuno is a digital fashion company, which curates iconic fashion moments of the time through images, videos or art ready for collection. We work with fashion photographers, directors, stylist, artists, celebrities as well of course as our beloved brands.

We have recently made 2 NFT drops: neuCard and Diesel x neuno alpha drop. Both NFTs will have linked wearables in DCL, starting from Diesel Prototype Sneakers, which will be our first linked wearable.

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

This scope includes:

&bull;	Integrate Decentraland with the Rarible Protocol such that it is possible to buy NFTs directly within the Decentraland interface

&bull;	Create a fee on the Decentraland front-end such that fees are directed to Decentraland DAO (optional)

&bull;	Allow parcel owners to display NFTs and to receive a certain % of fees from the sale via fee splits (which can be set)

## Description

Rarible recently launched the Rarible Protocol, which includes a decentralized and open source NFT exchange as well as minting contracts, an indexer, and various other bells and whistles for those building in the NFT space.

A great use case for the protocol is to integrate with marketplaces and metaverses like Decentraland. Below outlines how this could work.

The benefit to Decentraland is that you would be able to sell items directly from Decentraland, without directing users to other external applications. Right now, when you click on an NFT, you get something like this:

Link to Example: https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ff79e50f8b24000e668c1249be70400905a06fd.jpeg

These NFTs can be purchased on Opensea currently, and it is even possible for parcel owners to monetize on OpenSea referral fees (1%).

Using the Rarible Protocol, we can do much better. Rarible Protocol is the only open source and community owned NFT exchange protocol.

## Specification

What would this look like after integration with the Rarible Protocol?

1.  Items could be purchased directly from within the interface
2.  A fee could be set within the interface (2.5% for example, which is what Rarible.com has)
3.  That fee could be directed to Decentraland DAO (it is possible to set this fee upon creation of this integration, OR, we could just set it to zero. Maybe we could have a separate vote to determine what fee to include for Decentraland DAO)
4.  Fees and Royalties from external platforms (like SuperRare) could be carried over using the protocol
5.  NFTs from different blockchains could also be displayed (for example, we are integrating with Flow, Polygon, Moonbeam)
6.  What is even more cool is that the Rarible Protocol has fee splitting. So for example, a parcel owner could display NFTs that he does not even own, and receive a % of fees from that process!


## Personnel

In terms of implementation, HPrivakos has expressed interest in helping with this.
A portion of the fund will be used for design work or possible support from other devs, which will be handled by HPrivakos.


## Roadmap and milestones

This is a co-funded grant application between Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO. This proposal is asking for:

A grant to develop this functionality. Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO can fund this together, with a 5K contribution from Decentraland DAO (vested over 3 months with a 1 month cliff as per Decentraland Community Grants). Rarible DAO is asked to contribute 7K, with 1/2 paid upfront and 1/2 upon completion.

15866,15866,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should the Curation Committee receive a Compensation for their work? (Revised),"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Abstract**

To incentivize members of the curation committee, we need to compensate them for their time and contributions.

**This is a revised proposal based on the outcome and discussion of [this proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a4d9d090-f330-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258) to compensate Curation Committee Members.**

**Need**

The Wearables Curation Committee was formed to help ensure that all published wearables are technically sound before they are minted on Polygon and made permanently available to users.

The Curation committee is also tasked with identifying and flagging any submissions that may violate Decentraland's Content Policy and Terms of Use. These submissions are not to be vetted by the Committee but are instead passed onto the DAO for final approval or rejection. The ""handing off"" process for these submissions still takes effort and time from the Committee members.

In order to incentivize committee members to do this work, they need to be compensated fairly. Failing to compensate the Curation Committee will result in faster turn-over within the committee, and (likely) a subsequent decrease in the volume and quality of minted wearables.

**Approach**

People who submit Decentraland wearables for publication must pay a fee of 500 MANA per item in each collection submitted. A portion of these fees needs to be used to compensate the committee.

I suggest that each committee member be compensated with 10% of the publication fee (50 MANA) per item processed, regardless of whether the item is approved or rejected. These payments can be made in MANA by the DAO Committee on a monthly basis. Retroactive payments should be executed to compensate the committee for work they've done since June 1st.

According to [this query](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/decentraland/collections-matic-mainnet?query=Totals) on the Graph, the committee has published **227 separate collections** for a total of **466 items** since the launch of the Wearables Editor on **June 1, 2021** (as of the time of writing on August 12th). This total includes all submissions, including those that are rejected.

With the publication fee set at **500 MANA per item**, the DAO has collected **233,000 MANA** between June 1st and August 12th.

During the previous 73 days, this averages to:

*   1 collection / day / committee member
*   2.13 items / day / committee member

At the suggested rate of 50 MANA/item/committee member, **each member would receive a rough average of 3,195 MANA / month.**

**Benefit**

Basing compensation on the number of items processed has several benefits:

*   Each month, running a Graph query to calculate the amount of MANA to transfer to the committee members is simple and efficient.
*   The data that each month's compensation is based off is transparent and public for the community.
*   Starting at 50 MANA per creates incentives to grow the committee, and increase the number of wearables processed.

- Compensate Curators 50 MANA per item
- Compensate Curators, but find another rate

15868,15868,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,A Strategy to improve the relationship between MakerDAO and MANA.,"> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel#1f49)

**Summary**

This document details a tested strategy that will help the DAO secure the position of MANA in the MakerDAO ecosystem. It will do so by increasing the collateralized MANA in Maker protocol and increasing the liquidity volumes in decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

**Background**

[MakerDAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/) , one of the oldest DAOs, provides a significant service to the crypto and decentralized finance space: it’s the DAO behind the stablecoin known as DAI. DAI’s value is backed by different crypto assets such as ETH, USDC, USDT, etc. The MakerDAO community defines DAI as a “decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar.” DAI’s collateral backing, then, is part of the stablecoin’s essence.

In July 2020,  [MakerDAO included MANA](https://blog.makerdao.com/mana-approved-by-maker-governance-as-collateral-type-in-the-maker-protocol/)  as acceptable collateral for minting new DAI in the platform. This authorization represented excellent news for MANA, since it meant an upgrade in its status as a reserve of value. Users could now take out a DAI loan using their MANA as collateral without the need to sell it first.

Yet, in late 2021, MANA almost got downgraded again in a sudden turn of events. The attempt began with a signal request, a formal proposition for action or change in a specific platform. Signal requests are usually coupled with polls through which the community votes whether accept or decline the proposals. In September 2021,  [a signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offboard-mana-bat-zrx-lrc-univ2-linketh-and-univ2-aaveeth/10467)  from the MakerDAO forum presented a plan to remove MANA and some other tokens as acceptable collateral. By the time the polls closed in early October, the initiative had gathered enough votes to offboard and delist many tokens. But MANA, for its part, was spared from the offboarding. Thanks to community signaling, which advised against a downgrade, MANA persisted in the list of acceptable collateral for minting new DAI.

As observed per the cited signal request, the MakerDAO is interested in delisting unprofitable collateral types. The MakerDAO has sufficient incentive to remove the less efficient collateral types. First off, every collateral type has some fixed costs on oracle price feeds. On the other hand, each collateral type brings extra complexity to the team maintaining the project.

In this vein, MakerDAO is interested in seeing more DAI minted with MANA as collateral; otherwise, MANA might be delisted and no longer stand as acceptable collateral. Also, MakerDAO would like to see more liquidity in exchanges between MANA and DAI. They expect such increased liquidity because, if the price of MANA were to drop abruptly, a more liquid scenario would help reduce the risk of liquidating an undercollateralized position of MANA.

**Description**

The current fee to mint DAI using MANA as collateral is 6% annually.

After conversations with MakerDAO, they might consider reducing this fee to 3% if we (1) reach 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA while (2) increasing the liquidity in DEXs.

There are methodic steps in reaching both goals. Thus, this proposal describes the use of the DAOs Treasury holdings to increase the MANA collateral and liquidity in exchanges — therefore matching the two standards that MakerDAO expects.

As a side note, it’s important to mention that if this initiative succeeds, it will result in a very positive outcome for the MANA holding community. In what would be a significant step ahead, a MANA holder looking to request a loan using her MANA as collateral will find her annual rates cut by half.

**Specification**

The straightforward way to tackle the dual challenge would be contributing towards liquidity. So, for the sake of examples, let’s say the DAO wants to contribute 5M in collateralized MANA for this cause.

To contribute such a sum, The DAO would need to take some MANA from its treasury and lock it in a Maker Volt. In exchange for it, the DAO would receive 5M of DAI. This is, quite plainly, a loan collateralized with MANA.

Such a loan should be over-collateralized to ensure we don’t lose the collateral in the sudden event of a MANA price drop. Therefore, the suggestion is to do a 3x collateralized ratio. At the current MANA price, that would signify ~6,200,000 MANA, which would, in turn, represent 5M of DAI.

At the moment, we should pay an annual interest rate of 6%. Thus, keeping up with the former logic, it would represent 180,000 DAI. But that’s the worst-case scenario. Since the whole initiative intends to succeed, MakerDAO will eventually reduce this fee to 3%, thus downsizing the sum to half.

Afterward, we should position 5M of DAI + 5M worth of MANA in the MANA<>DAI Liquidity Pool at Sushiswap. Why Sushiswap? It’s simple: it has the deepest liquidity for the pair in any DEX. According to this  [MANA/DAI liquidity poll](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x495f8ef80e13e9e1e77d60d2f384bb49694823ef)  (LP), we can expect a return of investment of 2,000 DAI per day. It would not only cover the costs of the loan — but it would also leave a significant margin in net DAO profits.

The previous example, then, would prove successful in achieving the double goal of accruing 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA, all while increasing the liquidity in DEXs.

**Conclusion**

With a set of strategic steps, Decentraland’s DAO can significantly contribute to securing MANA’s position in the DAI ecosystem, maintaining MANA as acceptable collateral, reducing the loan fees for MANA holders, and improving the liquidity of DEXs.

There is a tested strategy to address this issue, and the DAO suggests we take on it.

Should guns attached to wearables be approved ?

MetaParty have already had a wearable approved and published named the Meta Soldier. The wearable includes a detailed black pistol attached to the avatars hand. This wearable was approved within 10 days.  We have sold over 200 of theses wearables to the DCL community.

Meta Soldier Wearable (Single Black Pistol)
https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0xe65fcdb82f516a2361e4e9af9897fd53ef796bb5/items/0

Recently we have submitted another wearable named the Exo Soldier. This wearable includes two golden pistols with suppressors. After 14 days of the wearable being under review we received a reply from a curator stating that wearables with guns are being discussed, as they may fall under the violent content category.

https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0xe65fcdb82f516a2361e4e9af9897fd53ef796bb5/items/0

Furthermore if guns are now classed as violent content then will all swords be classed as violent content and also need to be changed. I understand the two are different but depending on where you are in the world swords/knifes can be a lot more commonly used in violent crimes then guns.

In addition if weapons are now rejected what will be approved. Is a water pistol or ""ray gun"" acceptable?

## Abstract

Our project creates a new way for avatars to express themselves and customize their avatars using tattoos. Just like in the analog world we create art and add it to our skin in a way that lasts forever, we'd like to make it possible for avatars also to have this means of expression.  We believe tattoos are a powerful means of expressing oneself -- as a snapshot of a moment in time, an important feeling, in memory of something, as a reminder, or just for fun. We have an amazing team of skilled developers, VR artists, marketers, and a large collective of analog tattoo artists who will contribute their unique tattoo styles to this project.

## Description

Taking analog artists in the tattoo world and helping them have their first experience with the metaverse, NFTs, and Web3 is a passion project we are excited to bring to fruition. It's one of the areas we think is most interesting since many of these artists have yet to enter this space and create tattoos that can be used in the metaverse. We believe that we can empower this unique group of physical artists to enter this area and support them by transforming their craft into something that can be used on virtual avatars. For Decentraland users, this will create a new layer/way for them to express themselves -- just like we do in the real world. It will make avatars stand out and be themselves (or whoever who they'd like to be). As another layer of expression, this will differentiate Decentraland from other platforms and allow for further self-expression for users of the metaverse.

We know that the time is now:

1.  To create an easy process to allow physical tattoo artists to break into Web3 and the metaverse via the Decentraland platform
2.  To support these artists in this new realm and make it easy for them to convert their craft to something that fits Decentraland's avatars
3.  To build out a method to add the relevant normal maps and technological specifications to make tattoos visually appealing in Decentraland
4.  To give users the opportunity to further express themselves in Decentraland with tattoos just like they do in the physical world


## Specification

As a new project we are currently in the researching stage. Our team has VR artists and developers who are passionate about making our concept a reality. We already have a group of tattoo artists who are working on their unique art for this project and our VR team will be transforming their art into VR versions ready to be implemented on avatars in Decentraland. The development team is ready to work with Decentraland to find the best technological solution for how we can integrate into your platform and provide added value to your users.

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Did you know that Ethereum has the same carbon footprint as Ireland (39.18 Mt CO2/y) and consumes the same amount of energy as Chile (82.49 TWh/y)? Carbon footprint is related i.e to the consumption of fossil fuels, electricity consumption.

Global climate crisis is undeniable and alarming. Therefore, sustainability isn´t a 'nice to have' but a prerequisite for future business success.

We intend to calculate the carbon footprint of DCL infrastructure for 2021, which would position the DAO as an industry pioneer in terms of sustainability.

Once the carbon footprint is calculated, we{ll generate a report with the results and an action plan for its users and the company itself, in order to reduce and offset the greenhouse gas emissions.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x13DB57D2120dcB15528B4472387c4bf63d370397

15878,15878,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Decentraland should own historic NFTs like CryptoPunks.,"> by 0x95451954fcc80a6b3de8abd79902e0e4fb9ca4bd (Baahubali)

Being one of the early and best NFT projects, Decentraland should own historic NFTs like CryptoPunks.

Some advantages of buying such NFTs.

1.  Tourist Hub: Showcasing historic NFTs in Decentraland will increase visitors and can help Decentraland in becoming a virtual tourist hub.

2.  Diversification of DAO funds: CryptoPunks NFTs value is steadily rising and as liquid as cryptocurrencies. So investing in such assets increases the DAO fund stability. It is equivalent to buying GOLD.

3.  Free Advertising: Since VISA acquired one of the CryptoPunks there is a lot of attention towards NFTs especially CryptoPunks. This could help in grabbing more media attention and private investor which would accelerate the growth of Decentraland.

4.  It is inevitable that metaverses(or private investors inside metaverse) start buying these NFTs to showcase them for their visitors. It is better to be first than play catchup in acquiring these assets.

Some recent news and resources

1.  VISA company buying CryptoPunks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLxmQiFVj1U
2.  Recent transactions: https://opensea.io/activity/cryptopunks

Note: I recently created this post and deleted it since I was not able to add more information to the existing one.

- Yes - Decentraland should buy CryptoPunks
- No - Not worth it
- Interesting - Should explore the option
- Don't know about CryptoPunks - Need more information

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

FACE Fashion House has begun giving out 100 MANA creator grants to active users in the space. These grants cover the listing cost for Decentraland and enable people a way to make money from the space which results in them staying on the platform. 3,000 MANA is enough to give out two 100 MANA grants for 15 months to creators. We would manage this fund and reward 100% of it to the Decentraland community.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x4eae159A20c53836ad06CE9927Ad44859ba71422

## Description

This project is a direct benefit to the creator community of Decentraland. It enables users of the space to reward the ones they believe are making wearables they want to buy. The money would eventually circle back into DCL while also growing the marketplace with top-quality content. Creators would get funding for wearable projects that will launch many fashion ventures. All you need is one successful wearable launch to have your life completely changed by the metaverse.


## Specification

We have established a DAO on Snapshot which we will use to vote on creators. Currently, it is 100% centralized but I created a FACE Fashion Guild NFT that I am selling for .01 ETH. This gives users 1 vote in the DAO and there are 1000. The money made from the sale of these NFTs will go into funding wearables for the FACE Fashion House. I should note that grant winners are not required to be a member of the guild but a member must make the proposal on their behalf.


## Personnel

Creative Director - Anthony Sims (@asimsart) NFT artist (98.980 ETH in sales) https://cryptoart.io/artist/anthonysims

Wearable Designer - Michi Todd (@michi_todd) Fashion Designer and member of the DCL Wearable Approval Committee

Event Coordinator - YouMack (@y_youmack) Event manager in the space who actively onboards people into DCL.


## Roadmap and milestones

Every month we will be awarding two active community members with 100 MANA. The project's duration is 15 months.

Decentraland is unusable unless you have a computer with a graphics card.  Which means 99 percent of the people who want to use Decentraland cannot.  This is the reason why their DAU's remain low and land remains dormant.

As a land owner, investor, and potential user, I feel that Decentraland has not efficiently reported to the community their plan to port Decentraland on to anything other than a web browser.  I would like more details on when I could potentially use Decentraland on an Oculus, Playstation/Xbox, or Mobile tablet.

This poll is to determine if Decentraland should provide details, timelines, and priorities on a quarterly basis in an organized fashion to educate the community on their plans to port Decentraland to anything other than a web browser.

- Yes, there should be an organized quarterly report
- No, Decentraland should not inform the community in an organized manner

**Motivation**: If the DAO spend 30k MANA a month buying the cheapest LAND parcels on the market. Then we can redistribute those parcels to people that want to utilize it!

**Background**: After seeing the recent proposal for giving play-to-earn players 30k MANA a month. It reminded me of my previous forum post about restructuring LAND. https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-restructuring-the-land-business/452

**Ideas for LAND usage**:\
Monthly building competitions. (Where winners get their scene deployed)  \\
Build bus stops along roads  \\
Resell at a higher price.  \\
Build teleports  \\
Giveaways (for marketing)  \\

**Benefits**:
More developers getting involved \\
More LAND demand \\
More stuff to do in-game \\
MANA burned for each purchase \\

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

My videos will be aimed towards onboarding every part of the world into Decentraland.

The videos will range from getting started with metamask, obtaining mana, saving money on gas fees, navigating the marketplace, creating new wearables, and much more.

The purpose is to help onboard new users into the DCL ecosystem from every corner of the world.


## Grant size

4,500 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x2A8c613eee8c97d1d33c36eD87e75Abf44869627

## Description

We all have had the learning curve of using metamask, obtaining crypto, bridging, etc. The crypto currency technology can be very confusing and hard to understand. Most of us look towards videos to help us figure it out, but what if there is nothing in your language? You may simply give up and move on.

This is something I would like to deter from in the future Decentraland growth.

I will be creating a standard, simple to follow, video that we can use as a base for each subject. From there I will make use of voice translators to voice over each video to compile an entire collection of tutorials in every language possible.

These languages will include:

*   English
*   Spanish
*   Mandarin Chinese
*   French
*   Tagalog
*   Japanese
*   Arabic
*   Thai


## Specification

Utilizing the Discord server we have filled with members of across the world, we will hire people of the native language that is needed per video. This will create income to those around the world, which in some countries may be well over their normal income, helping support a wide range of communities and families.

As a very last option, Google has created a lifelike speech bot that can translate and speak from text. We will be utilizing the technology they made available to us to fill in any language that we cannot obtain a fluid speaker. This is something we will refrain from using, unless absolutely needed so to meet any deadlines on the project.

https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech


## Personnel

*   Deno Duvruex

twitch.tv/denosodeno
twitter.com/denosodeno

I will be creating the English videos alone, then hiring bi-lingual team members via Discord and DCL to join each video as a voice actor.


## Roadmap and milestones

ROADMAP

*   Create 5 tutorials to show a simple step-by-step process of each subject which include; Using metamask - Buying and bridging etheruem to stwitch into Mana - Joining DCL and how to get started in game - Navigating the DCL marketplace - How to get started selling your wearables/land as a creator

*   Write a script for each language used in video

*   Release all videos in language categorized folders

*   Start a mass marketing campaign that till reward top referrals with wearables and Mana

Hello!

My name is Brandonmanus.ETH and I believe I have what it takes to change how people experience Decentraland.

I was blessed with a baritone octave voice. That meaning I sound like the ""In a world..."" guy from movie trailers.

My Proposal is that in the future, when ever this project needs more voice talent on the team, that I (Brandonmanus.ETH) will be among the first few to be considered for a role as a Male Voice Actor for Decentraland.

Imagine Hearing a James Earl Jones type voice for In game Achievements, Trailers, and basic interactions between avatars BUT that voice was a talent found from the community.

Here is a Link to my YouTube to hear what I sound like -

## Abstract

We are a team of award-winning storytellers, with more than 20 years of experience, and deeply passionate about DCL.

## Description

We aim to develop a strong community of storytellers that will work together to create the navite web3 cinema format.

These films will not just be shot at DCL, but will be premiered at the STUDIOLAND..

We also want to add a podcast studio, bringing already established podcasts to record their shows in DCL , as well as new talents looking forward to sharing their stories.

Anyone with a good story to tell, will be welcomed at the STUDIOLAND.

In both cases the intention is to invite the audiences to participate in the recordings of the podcast and the premiers of the films, and through this expand the DCL community.

We are WOW LAND, a group of content creators that got together in 2002, that are web3 enthusiasts and want to create the first audiovisual hub inside DCL.

Regarding films and series, through DOC LAND (  www.doclandfilms.com ) we don’t only have the recognition of the industry as independent producers, but also of the audiences and festivals. From Grammys, to the Oscars to the first prize at the Montreal Film Festival.

Dying to Tell (2018) - https://doclandfilms.com/es/portfolio/morir-para-contar-2/
Born in Syria (2017) - https://doclandfilms.com/es/portfolio/nacido-en-siria/

We also create podcasts through POD LAND ( www.podland.com ). Two of our most successful shows are related to crypto/web3 and gaming.

¿Por qué no te habré hecho caso? (“I should’ve listened to you”)
Crypto podcast hosted by Santiago Siri - YCombinator founder and Proof of Humanity creator https://podland.com/portfolio/por-que-no-te-hice-caso-todo-sobre-el-mundo-cripto/

Videojuegos, entiende a tu hijo (Gaming, understanding your kids)
Gaming podcast hosted by Eric Murillo - KPI Gaming founder and Ex Twitch director for Spain
https://podland.com/portfolio/videojuegos/

This background gives us the conviction that we have the network and the skills to make the STORYLAND community thrive.

Create native content and reproduce exogenous content.
Invite the audiences to participate.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

‘Filmrare’ is a Travelling Cinematheque that can host Film Screenings, Archive films & film-related artifacts. The aim of this space is to build a communal experience around cinema by encouraging diverse voices to exhibit their films and enabling different audiences to engage with filmmakers, Films & Film History.

The Cinematheque will host independent films across Art House, Genre Cinema & Diverse Upcoming Voices. The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.

The entire grant will be used to acquire land(1 parcel) that we have recognized as a good location to begin our development. Renting land is both difficult and hard

20,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

## Description

‘Filmrare’ will be a cultural destination in Decentraland with daily screenings & conversations around Cinema. While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q\&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.

The pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.

We also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies.

The intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.

Video streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access.

Our previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold. We are resubmitting it with the recent DAO changes and hope to get approved.


## Specification

The cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first. A demo can be seen here -> https://youtu.be/AtczYVUIoLU

The building is being built using Blender 3D models and the DCL SDK. We also have a screening site https://filmrare.com where we have used ERC-1155 tokens to provide access to content. We intend to use the same technology here for ticketed events where the token holders would be allowed to watch screenings.


## Personnel

The team consists of the below three members who bring engineering, creativity, and industry experience.

Ravi Krishnan, Founder of Filmrare ->https://www.linkedin.com/in/krcnow/

Mathivanan Rajendran, Program Director at Root.ax -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathivananr/

Arun Karthick BAFTA Breakthrough director -> https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/breakthrough/arun-karthick-directorwriter


## Roadmap and milestones

The roadmap for the project is as below

January - Parcel acquisition and scene deployment. Testing with BETA users for the multiplayer experience, live streaming, and ERC-1155 based ticketing.

February - Public domain movie screenings by creating events in DCL. Pitching to filmmakers and lining up the editorial. Pitching to film festivals. Early testing of screening plus socializing.

March - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam). This would be accompanied by other films.

April-June - Conducting events at scale with month-long programming.

### Summary

Hire a team to maintain and improve the Governance App and develop new tools.

### Abstract

The DAO is the beneficiary of a 10-year  [vesting contract](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac)  for a total of 222M of MANA, that is *1.8 million MANA vested per month*. This has been mentioned  [in the docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/the-dao-fund/)  and  [in the blog](https://decentraland.org/blog/platform/community-funding/)  before, but many may not be aware of it.

The DAO has a lot of resources and a thriving community but lacks executing power. We need to invest more money and time in building infrastructure for Decentraland’s DAO.

At the moment the DAO has 4 teams:

*   Security Advisory Board: 5 people to address security risk.
*   DAO Committee: 3 people to enact proposals on-chain.
*   DAO Facilitator: 1 person to produce reports and organize meets.
*   Wearable Curation Committee: 3 people to review applications.

This proposal aims to create a new team with the mission of developing new software.

### Motivation

At the moment the DAO is supporting contributions in the form of grants aimed to individual contributors. As an open-source project we rely on external contributors, being The Foundation the most active contributor.

The Foundation team has ~45 people working under their wing, they have been doing an amazing job and brought us a great decentralized platform and a world explorer to enjoy it.

But in order to accomplish the wider goal of becoming a more capable and powerful DAO, we need to take action. We need to onboard new contributors to help build Decentraland’s ecosystem. We need to create our own teams capable of executing the vision of the DAO.

We can start by speeding the development of our Governance dApp. This app is a critical piece of software for the DAO and it needs to be well maintained. It's also a small project in terms of scope, which makes it a great place to start.

### Specification

A team of highly capable full-time contributors will be assembled, filling the primary roles of Team Lead, Product Manager, Technical Writer, Web Designer, Solidity and, frontend dev.

The main scope of this team will be:

*   Become core maintainers of the Governance dApp.
*   Automate key processes of DAO’s operations.
*   Research proposals in order to enrich conversations.
*   Build new dApps to support community use-cases.

The DAO will set a budget and formally delegate the Governance dApp to the team. The team will be free to work on ideas that make the conversation in the governance more fruitful. The team will report their progress and consult their roadmap with the community.

This team won’t be focusing on contributing to projects already maintained by The Foundation (eg. client, builder, marketplace). If they do, they will be treated by the maintainers as regular open-source contributions.

A list of things to work on the Governance dApp at the moment:

*   Automate generation of reports.
*   Replace Aragon's UI to ease DAO Committee operations.
*   Add a Treasury page showing stats of the current treasury.
*   Add a Grants page showing all grants that have been or are being funded by the DAO.
*   Add a Members' page listing current teams and members.
*   Load forum comments on the proposal to encourage discussion.
*   Implement automatic status updates of proposals in the forum.
*   Work on reports on technical viability about discussed proposals.
*   Implement content moderation tools for the community, DAO Facilitator, and DAO Committee to help filter out offensive, poorly defined, or spammy proposals.
*   Improve the proposal creation process by adding new proposal categories for common actions in the DAO.
*   Advance the grant program to include larger grants with a more robust vetting and oversight process

Funding a team to work primarily on the Governance dApp will produce faster development than relying on individual contributions because of their capability of shipping cross-cutting features.

This is a push to boost Decentraland’s ecosystem. We’ll start with one piece by building a team to improve it. If this strategy proves successful we could build more scoped teams to maintain and build other projects.

The point of this proposal is to reach a consensus that the DAO should begin the process of forming its own dApps team. The details of how many members, what their roles are, how much they are paid and how often, and how the DAO can oversee their work should be covered in a separate proposal(s).

### Vote

*   **For**: Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO
*   **Against**: Do not hire a dApps team to help build the DAO

## Abstract

The main goal of this project is to immortalize Crypto personalities inside the blockchain and that is why I would like to build a cemetery to house Crypto Personalities that we had lost. I'm aiming to buy 2 parcels to honor the life of any crypto personality voted by the dao. To start we will make a ceremony for the Bogdanoff Twins who sadly died of Covid. The parcels can be owned by decentraland so we could work something even for free. Right now I would love to buy 2 parcels to honor the life of the Bogdanoff Twins who are very popular for their appearance on memes all over the internet.

The new wearable feature added in Decentraland allows user to upload their own wearables in the metaverse. However, they have to pay 500 MANA to publish each item, not each NFT, which makes the market unaffordable for most 3D designers. I would like to propose to lower the fee, even deleted, so more businesses can jump to the market, make profits, and use these profits to promote the Decentraland Metaverse through private marketing.

GM DCL Community!

Please forgive me if I am missing anything, but I haven't been officially involved in a DAO before and this idea just came to my mind and I wanted to gauge the community's thought towards this idea.

I am a video content creator and a parcel owner, in the past, I have hosted several Decentraland events on my parcel, hoping to bring people together and to create experiences within the Decentraland Metaverse.

I started my channel because I felt that many stories within Web 3.0 were not told and many influencers only focus on the monetary aspect of the space, if you are interested in what I am doing, you can check it out on my website or some interview snippets on my Instagram.

My website is: www.nonfungibletc.com

Interview Highlights: https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17954641258811748/

This was my Gallery Opening Event: https://youtu.be/1H2WJu1Z6ao

Interview with Franklin and Gallery Event: https://youtu.be/Nqo86mdodk8?t=1637

Recently, I have created a video about my journey as a parcel owner and shared some tips and tricks on how to do your research and what factors to consider when buying land on the Decentraland platform.

Since my channel is all organic, I wasn't able to get a lot of views, and seeing that Decentraland has a DAO, where people could apply for funding. I was wondering if I could request for an advertising funding and buy advertisement on YouTube, so that more people could understand what it is to be a parcel owner and the steps involved?

My video has nothing to do with price predictions or parcel predictions, but more of an outline of what to consider before buying land, buying land, and what you can do after buying land.

My experience as a parcel owner: https://youtu.be/\_p4tPkakm3Q

The question I have is whether the community would be interested in this request for grant and if something similar has been done before? Usually what would be the budget for a similar request and what proof or deliverables are needed if a proposal is approved?

So far everything that I have done with regards to the channel are all non-paid, since I really want to let people know more about the Web 3.0 space, besides some transaction fees, I could basically allocate thee whole budget on the advertisement spend, since I really hope to let people understand this space.

Looking forward to your feedback and advice!

Thanks,
Non-Fungible TC

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Decentraland is getting better and better. With an increasing number of users, events and buildings, we believe in the future of Decentraland, and we want to push it forward through our expertise. However, as professional architects and urban designers, we found it tough to find a city or district with real Metaverse-style city planning, a friendly traffic system for users, and sufficient motivations to attract visitors and projects. Thus, we are here to bring our solutions, to build a prototype as a future metaverse city that is fancy, walking-friendly and vivid!

B. The New Babylon City Prototype Size: about 30 parcels (Sponsored by Republic Realm)

For more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon

C. Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?

1.  City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse

Most of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely &ldquo;wired&ldquo; from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.

2.  Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality

The vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.

3.  User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel

Teleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.

## Description

The marketplace in DCL needs a a few additions. This would be my first of a few updates I think would make the marketplace more user friendly.

Surfing through wearables to find a certain mint # is time consuming when you have to click each wearable and then when you ""go back"" it refreshes everything and you start over.    Adding the mint # on the display of the wearable would make for a user friendly search within marketplace.


## Specification

Hoping DCL will fix this!


## Personnel

Hoping DCL will fix this!


## Roadmap and milestones

I would hope this can be implemented as soon as possible. I have a few other proposals I would like to add to the marketplace. But I believe this would be a fairly simple fix as all that needs to be added to the wearable is the mint # on the display picture.

## Description

As a community, we are entering an exploration phase to review different adoption cases for this new consumption and communication tendencies. In this context, the opportunity arises to adjust the balance towards certain segments that, due to lack of proper channels, have been exploited for the last few decades. We seek to promote an ethical and conscious evolution of virtualization and decentralization.

The commercialization scheme linked to musical NFTs is in a speculative stage. The real value that it offers for users turns out to be quite confusing once we dig deeper and try to go beyond the resale possibilities and the warranty that the image associated with them provides.

We aim to develop an ecosystem that provides the stimulus of a scalable and sustainable bond between creators and audiences through their interaction in Decentraland. The social element will be the engine that powers our marketplace, where exclusive content and presentations of our curated catalog of creators will provide added value to the participants. Also, each user will be able to manage a crate or personalized library that will allow him or her to showcase their assets in the platform as well as in our virtual district, promoting a sense of owning a unique collection, user interaction and direct financing from communities to creators.

Our multidisciplinary team is composed by professionals that specialize in all key areas of the productive chain: from musicians to engineers, producers, creatives, developers and a vast array of resources and capacities joined together by the passion of linking music with technology, as well as the desire to contribute to the development of interactions and flow of energy in the shape of information that Decentraland and the whole crypto ecosystem provides.

## Specification

BeatBlox Muisc District:

Our primary goal is to keep developing the possibilities offered by the Metaverse, with our district in Decentraland being the main focus of the BeatBlox expansion. We seek to develop an ecosystem that allows artists to create additional revenue and distribution channels, while enabling a more deep connection with their audiences. There, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual concerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.

BeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content care in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork. This is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the interactive installations and NFT associated services. We are creating strategic alliances with music and blockchain fields referents for the development of user focused experiences and content. By doing this, we aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use of Decentraland.

Come and visit us at 40,44.

BeatBlox Marketplace and Academy:

By using Polygon and reducing minting costs significally, we have succesfully implemented a NFTs sales and distribution system that allows floor prices as low as USD 1. We also gave birth to a concept in its entirety for our Decentraland district.

In this opportunity, we are reaching out to the community for helping us to strength the development, the promotion and the scalability of an integral platform. This will add value to users in the metaverse, while helping to reduce adoption barriers for new participants

This platform will be leveraged by a marketplace with expanded social functionalities, a curated catalog to ensure high quality standards and an Academy to support the adoption of new technologies linked to a further democratized access for artists and users to the vast opportunities that this technology provides.

Hello, everyone. Today I want to talk about a thing that is stopping the progress of Decentraland events. This thing is latency on streams.

What I mean is that every time someone tries to stream inside a screen there are many seconds between the real world and what the screen shows. Inside DCL, it's usually about 20seconds or more depending on the server and where is the player located.

I have seen that this thing makes events less enjoyable. For example, if there is a streamer and you talk in the chat of DCL, you need to wait a lot until that person responds/interacts with you.

In this sense, events that depend on streaming are very slow. Most of the players will end up following the stream via Twitch or YouTube (if the event manager is also streaming there) and it kills the experience.

Right now, I want to make new events with cool ideas but those events depend on streaming and it's quite impossible to do it with 20+ seconds of delay (most of the time is 40seconds).

I think this problem exists because of HLS which is the protocol Decentraland uses. From what I have seen, it is good in terms of compatibility but latency sucks. There are other options available such as WebRTC, RTMP and more. I don't know what could work with DCL but I think we need to change this. Streaming is very important and streams make events better and open new doors.

Please open the forum post that references this proposal so we all have a nice and polite discussion.

Thanks for reading!

P.S: with better latency, we could make epic streams with games, karaokes and a bunch of stuff! Think it (: !

**Summary**

Proposal for terms under which members of the Decentraland community may use Decentraland’s name and logo

**Motivation**

Currently, there is uncertainty among users as to when and how Decentraland’s name and logo may be used. This question comes up most often in relation to creating wearables or social media profiles.

Decentralization and community ownership are core values of Decentraland, so user generated content is paramount.  In the spirit of supporting UGC and community ownership, the community should have clearer guidelines for when and how individuals can use the Decentraland name and logo.

**Proposal**

\_Terms of Use for Decentraland’s Logo and Name \_

Decentraland is a decentralized virtual world governed by its users and as such strongly supports user generated content (UGC). People may use the Decentraland logo and name in their creations within Decentraland, but must follow the following terms.

1.  **Allowable Usage.** Users shall comply with these terms as well as Decentraland’s Terms of Use (https://decentraland.org/terms/) and Content Policy (https://decentraland.org/content/) in order to be allowed to use the Decentraland name and logo within Decentraland.

Should the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

I lost my mana during a transaction from poloniex to bittrex, because i sent my mana to the mana's conctract. I ask for understanding and help from the community, I am in good faith. Please read all i wrote in the ""Description"" of this grant request. For me is very important.


## Grant size

358 USD

## Beneficiary address

## Description

I sent some days ago, around 335 mana from poloniex to bittrex, before to sent my mana I verified if the contract was correct (when you deposit a token on bittrex, bittrex advice you to do this). When I copied the bittrex address for the deposit, I don't pressed correctly the keys control+C of my keyboard, so unfortunately during the paste, I used the mana's contract address (last value stored before my new copy and paste wrong). Due to the fact that the alphanumeric addresses are similar I let the transaction go. Usually I'm extremely careful to do these operations, but for first time I was wrong. These mana are very important for me, I'm a student, I need of it. I know that in the cryptoworld 335 mana are insignificant, aren't 1M of mana, but for me are very very important. So the only way to recover my mana (as advice from the developers who unfortunately can't recover my mana) is to ask a grant, a grant to be understood as a help to a guy who was just unlucky during a transaction, I know every transaction must be conducted with care, but I just hope for your understanding, it could happen to everyone.
I can provide a screenshot of my poloniex activity like proof of my error in good faith if is necerssary. My transaction hash is:
Transaction Hash:

0xa92a985348206d5954ff238d2d75069ebef4cea6d64953401a7eaf95f27f28c0

and like you can see my transaction started effectively exactly from
Poloniex with destinantion the Mana's contract. As advice from a dev, I used the value of 335 Mana at market price in usd with an increase of arount 30 dollars to cover a bit any upward movements. In every case if the price will be more low, like I wrote to a dev, I will return an eventual surplus to the DAO itself. I just need to recover my mana and not more. In this moment the price is around 1.07$ for mana (binance) so I will try to ask 358$, not more. I trust in the understanding of the community and I thank those who want to help me.

Feel free to contact me by mail. Thanks for all you can do for me.

Should the following Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

I plan on releasing a series of Youtube videos to encourage beginners/novice modelers to create and upload wearables to Decentraland.


## Grant size

2,500 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x59c0a6F97EcbA25CA7b404815E5CA0CD99E642bA

## Description

Decentraland is filled with many creatives of all skill levels from around the world! Currently, there are few guides that walk beginner content creators through a step-by-step process of how to model/upload/market their own wearables. I aim for my videos to help those new to 3D modeling mint their own wearables.


## Specification

On Youtube I will launch a series of videos detailing the steps to modeling/uploading/marketing your own wearable. There will be a total of 6 videos to breakdown the process (2 videos per wearable modeled.) Example: Video 1 (Part 1) will detail the modeling of a wearable whilst Video 1 (Part 2) will detail the uploading/marketing of said wearable. I plan on modeling a shirt, a pair of pants, and will let viewers vote to decide the last item to be modeled. I will also give away 150 MANA at the end of each Part 2 video for viewers to put towards content creation or the purchase of wearables from the market. I will use Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing, Blender for modeling, and Adobe Photoshop for texturing.


## Personnel

I will be the sole creator of this project. I am a content creator proficient in the Adobe Creative Suite. I have directed/edited/produced short videos and podcasts for freelance work as well as for personal projects. In addition to working as a graphic designer, I currently create 3D garments in Blender for local streetwear brands.

15940,15940,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Add Sebastian Valla to the Wearables Curation Committee,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Summary**

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The [Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/) was formed to help with this process.

There are currently only three individuals sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the [call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047),  Sebastian Valla was nominated:

""Sebastian is Wonderzone's Art Lead and wearables designer. With a bachelor's degree in 3D modeling and game design, Sebastian has been working as a professional 3D artist for the last 4 years. Since Decentraland's launch in 2020, Sebastian has created over 10 different wearables collections for the Foundation and for Wonderzone. Notable examples include the Wonderbot, Outfit of Wonder, and the Materochaser collections.

Sebastian has also worked with numerous members in the community, helping to coach them through the creation and publication process. You can view Sebastian's portfolio on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/sebastianvalla/collections/portfolio).""

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the [DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b) to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

## NFT Collections Description

We have created a collection of 40 NFT wearable sneakers in collaboration with 25 of the hottest web3 projects, including exclusive models created in partnership with Decentraland, Polygon and The Sneakerheadz Society.

Across the 40 designs in the collection, there are a total of 5,000 pairs of sneakers. These NFT wearables are the world's first Italian handmade leather phygital sneakers which you can wear exploring Decentraland, or you can burn the NFT to redeem the identical physical pair of sneakers to wear in real-life.

## Motivation

We are super hyped to bring our wearables to Decentraland!

We're excited to share our sneakers with the DCL community, and all the exceptional communities of the projects we've collaborated with to create NTR1-META's, so all can enjoy and wear our remarkable sneakers!

We moved into Crypto Valley 1.5 years ago, made ourselves at home, and put on some wild events for the community in TrustSwap HQ. We're now taking our involvement with the community to the next level by dropping these wearables!

NTR1-META sneakers are inspired by the magic of the chameleon. Our team admires the human ability to change in the face of adversity, much like how the Chameleon morphs the color of its skin cells to survive in the most challenging circumstances.

Hey everyone, If you let private enterprise also have mini-DAO like structures built off of a MANA chain we could turn Decentraland into a Decentralized social media platform. And I know technically speaking it already is but what I am suggesting is similar to how Facebook has business pages and groups but they would be a DAO structure community page for groups, businesses, event spaces, etc. This way we could have a place for all of our DCL announcements and community without having to use an outside 2 Dimensional resource to communicate with people not in world.

The way the DAO could be set up is generate a coin with however much MANA you put in divided by the coin amount. Price of coin in this use wouldn't be the main concern because it would be primarily based on it's utility to vote in your community decisions.

More unpopular opinion: We could also make the pages only accessible to land owners.

## Abstract

To learn more about Sophisticated Culture Foundation please visit our Website and watch our Video on the first page or read the description below. This gives you an understanding of our Mission & Vision.

https://www.sophisticatedculture.com

The Sophisticated Culture Foundation is a Non Profit Organization that aims to promote excellence in artistic and creative development with an extraordinary vision.  we push our work with our own academy, as a music publisher, record label, recording studio, practice stage, artist hotel and as a training center for artists who cannot afford professional development themselves.

We like to join Decentraland and create an extraordinary place to support Music Artists and Artists creating digital Art.


## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x02712d62210b1f5bFD17B69E242F19F922eEC031

## Description

As a non-profit organization, we push our work with our own academy, as a music publisher, record label, recording studio, practice stage, artist hotel and as a training center for artists who cannot afford professional development themselves.

Our work is free for selected artists who meet our selection criteria, but we also expect a high level of progression, skill and love for your own art.

We are financed by donations, endowments, endorsements, memberships and, shortly, by issuing our own crypto token and by issuing our projects as NFTs and digital and physical releases.

Furthermore, we generate income as a music publisher, music label and artist management and donation-based free services such as online mixing & mastering, offering our teaching content with our online academy as well as our on-site and online master classes.

Our main goal is to support outstanding bands, musicians, artists and composers who cannot afford the professional recording of their music and who cannot yet earn a living with the music. But their art is that good that it absolutely has to be heard. We want to find these artists and make our offer. In addition we also support music and sound design for film, documentary and series.

With a “charitable social DeFi token” and Artist Project NFT´s it is possible for us to finance our NPO´s Projects and ensure a solid  Mission.

In addition to regular releases such as physical CD´s and digital Releases as Download and Streaming, we believe in creating NFT´s for each funded Artist Projects and each released Artist on our own Labels we just established. With our Music Publishing Department we are able to sync music to film, documentary and even commercial use. All to get our Artists a good revenue und to finance future projects on the long run.

We consider ourselves as a modern and open minded Organization useing all available optins to fullfill our Mission & Vision. Therefore it is mandatory that we also have a solid appearance in the metaverse and web 3.0.

If we get the grant we are going to invest it to purchase a huge piece of land or even an entire own Server to connect it to the Grid.

We want to use this appearance to explore new Artists for our Funding, network and connecting with our Followers and Supporters we might reach in Decentraland.

The Funds will also be used to finance the Projects of Artists we discover and find in Decentraland.

We have founded and taken over 4 Labels. We support all Genres of Music and consider ourselves as an up and coming Indie Major Label & Publisher just with an charitable Background and the Vision to ensure Artistic Freedom.

Our Objectives are not just music support. We work with successful award winning Film Producers with productions on the Big Screen & the respective Streaming Platforms. We want to support Composers for Film & Documentary Music & give them the option to use our studios to record their score as a contribution to film funding.
We established an Online & Offline Academy to teach several fields of artistic knowledge such as Self Marketing for Artists, Artist Development, Music Business Administration for Artists but also technical Courses for Audio Engineering, Mastering, Film Making, Media Design. All Tutors offering courses are Industry Professionals, They all contribute some of their time voluntarily. We will offer all Classes for free.The Academy will be open to everybody.

Learn more about all our Vision here : www.sophisticatedculture.com


## Specification

We will use the Grant to buy a large piece of land or a own exclusive server that offers loads of space for our Foundations work to support creativity.

Creative Hang Out

Our Land  will contain several cozy places to hang out and communicate with other Artists and Music Enthusiasts, as well as with Music Lovers.

Artist Spaces

On our Land  we like to give Decentraland Artists a chance to present themself without investing in own land and the need to pay for it. So we create several Plots that Artists can use for presenting and  selling  Music and  all kinds of other digital Art as NFT´s. It will be a place like a Gallery.

As we can´t serve all Artists, we will have limited Spots. Artists can apply with examples and our A\&R Team will decide about the Artists that are getting a Plot. Every Plot will be given to the Artist for about 3-4 weeks.

All Artists playing on our Center or Club Stage will automatically be eligible for a Plot to sell their Art and to promote the concerts upfront. Like a typical Concert Merchandise  Shop

The Foundations Virtual Office

We will create an Office with regular Opening Hours. Here we make sure that anybody can get in touch with us. That means while we are woking in real life we also have an eye on any possible Vistors inside Decentraland.

The Academy

With our Online Academy we want to break new ground.  All content is offered for free  & our Live Courses and Masterclasses can be accessed also in Decentraland Talking to the Tutors is possible.

The Event Stages

We plan  several stages with plenty of space for visitors, and also going to stream the shows there to the real world on relevant Video Platforms with the goal to get them for the next show into Decentraland.
In General; The Performers need to be able to play 100% of the playtime with their own Songs either presented as a Band, Solo Performer, DJ Set or as a Live Act. All Performers need to be present with an Avatar on Stage and are required to Stream the Show from their Home, Bandroom or Studio via Videostream.We also will publish the schedule on our Website.

the planned Stages are…

a Club Stage for electronic music Artists! Not just DJ´s!

a Center Stage for Band Music.

a Open Stage. We offer a stage for Artists with an open schedule 24/7/365. Any Artist can book Playtime & promote the Show. The Open Stage is closed during official Events.

One of our Partners is Microsoft Azure Platform to  video streaming.

The Foundation Store

With 4 Labels a Publishing Department and around 24 upcoming funded projects per year we also like to use Decentraland as a place, where interested Visitors can obtain our Label Releases and Project Releases as an NFT. The Difference to a regular sold item in a Download Store is that NFT´s provide Studio Master Files, exclusive NFT-only Content. NFTs will be available 6-8 weeks BEFORE the Public release.

The Store will be Open to any other Artist with digital Art so we offer a wide range of music and digital Art to Decentraland.

Creative Sandbox for In-World Builders

We will offer a Sandbox for Decentraland Builders who like to create any sort of Art inside of Decentraland. Same as with the Artist Plots, we offer Plots of different sizes free of charge to Builders. They can create their Project and keep it there for around 4 weeks and place also a Donation Box to get some tips for their creation.The Building Artists decide also on the Donation Split to the Foundation.


## Personnel

Our Founders and Team consist of Artists, Audio Engineers, Radio Hosts, Film- and Theatre Actors, DJ´s. Live Performers, Film Directors, Film Producers and Music Industry Professionals.

Itch.io is a game marketplace with over 20 Million Visits in the past 6 months.

I personally had published my games there and they have people ready to play whatever game is published there.

I suggest creating a page for Decentraland on Itch.io it is Free and it will generate new Users.

Games like Amongus are published in Itch.io, so I feel that there is no downside to joining itch.io

If DCL enters Itch.io It would be good to see monthly users numbers generated from Itch.io.

Hi all,

Just an idea, but wouldn't it be could to have a sort of pet to walk behind you?
Something like a wearable people can create with walking and idle animation or someting.

Let me know what you think!

I recently published a collection and have been waiting for a week for the review. Some other people published their items and got it reviewed in 1-2 days.

Everyone pays the same price for reviews, hence this bureaucratic behaviour needs to be killed.

The proposal is to enforce a first come first serve policy. Someone from the review committee must make a ""first response"" on the wearables submitted earliest before responding to the new ones.

For now, it can be enforced as a community policy with possibility of action via dao against wearable committee members who do not follow it.

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

A simple, straightforward project, aimed at collecting all of DCL's POIs in one easy-to-access interface. This will be integrated into the interoperable https://metaverse-events.xyz/ website.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xe1f5ea171C5690A7Df19c99040248E584371Eabc

## Description

Currently, finding a POI in Decentraland requires you to open the DCL Map, and move across a 2D interface to see what you can potentially experience.

The few access points that exist in DCL (like the ones in Genesis Plaza) don't fully capture the vast amounts of POIs that already exist in Decentraland.

We wish to change this.

By scraping data from the DCL DAO votes, and by getting users to travel across the DCL Map, we want to create a database of all the current existing POIs in Decentraland, and minimally add them into an upcoming events hub called https://metaverse-events.xyz/ . The data-scraping will ensure that we can continue updating the site with newly approved POIs.

This will eventually allow us to connect events being organised in POI spaces to actual events on the metaverse-events website & the DCL Website. This is just a first step in being able to create a one-stop-shop for all Metaverse Events and meeting points in DCL.


## Specification

https://metaverse-events.xyz/ is an upcoming project that aims to interoperably promote different events across the Metaverse.

Whilst this is an entirely independent project, we want to start laying out the foundations for POIs to have a more accessible and immersive scope to how the user finds and experiences different points of interest in Decentraland.

This process will take approximately a 2-3 weeks, where members of our team will begin by outlining all the different POIs in Decentraland, and writing a short description of each POI. These will then be implemented into the Metaverse-Events platform, where users can search, browse and discover different POIs (coupled with tags and descriptions) and jump directly into Decentraland through an easy-to-use UI.


## Personnel

This project, alongside the mother project https://metaverse-events.xyz/, is being spearheaded by Metaverse Architects, one of the leading Metaverse-Development team in the Metaverse Sector.

Metaverse Architects are an innovative design and event planning firm, specializing in 3D modeling and game development across multiple metaverses. Their in-house team of skilled architects, developers, marketers, and designers are dedicated to building metaverse use cases on a daily basis, and are a one-stop-shop for all your metaverse needs.

You can find more information on the team here:
https://metaverse-architects.com/


## Roadmap and milestones

This project will take 4 weeks to implement, with 2 weeks dedicated to collecting data, refining tags and producing content/information on the POIs. The following two weeks will be dedicated towards ensuring the right implementation and user experience is created for the POI space.

Currently, when you click on a wearable in the marketplace it shows the whole object.  This makes it impossible to see the details of large objects. We would love to see a zoom in feature so that you can look at the details of wearables before you buy.

We see this as a magnifying glass icon next to the 'shirt' and 'try on' feature icons, or using a scroll wheel on your mouse.

I think that the search for wearables is very limited right now.

I propose two changes:

*   Allow search by price ranges.
*   Group items by item and price.
    An invented example:
    007 jacket listed 100 times at 1 mana.

You search cheapest item, and you have some pages with each 007 jacket.

Should be better have only 1 item listed with the number of items on sale by that price. And if you are interested and click in the 007 jacket, you will see the list of each items on sale by user.

## Abstract

I am going to be hiring a ""Life Coach"" that specializes in assisting people to prepare and finalize their TEDx. He has a helped 300+ people reach their goal of sharing their message with the world, for some ultimately landing paid speaking and book deals. Real quick overview of the message I'm going to be sharing. Misdiagnosed and mismedicated at 12, a first suicide attempt at 14, high school and collegiate athlete. Diagnosed Bipolar at 19. Broke my back snowboarding at 22, in come the opiates and back surgeries. Multiple suicide attempts (life support for 7-10 days), rehabs, and psych wards. Thought bipolar diagnosis was a death sentence, no Dr. told me anything different. Finally overcame. No more meds and life worth living.

## Description

I have been on the crypto/blockchain journey for a little over 3 years (seriously for 2) and I can't believe how many people are still so reticent to take the plunge. My intent is once I have a platform with which to ""inspire and influence"" people (not to be arrogant) I hope to help brick and mortars make the transition to blockchain and online literacy.  I have an old-school mentality with a forward/future-looking mindset. I refuse to play by anyone else rules for the sake of decorum. I refuse to live according to any labels, titles, and roles that I disagree with either morally or philosophically. I am whole, healthy, and a force to be reckoned with, I will not go quietly into that good night. I will help tear down this infernal machine brick by brick, bringing it all down on my head if I must. I will not let this garbage be passed on to my children. Help me.


## Specification

Pay the ""tuition"" for the Life Coach and his team. I have already had a final interview, just waiting to raise the funding to begin the one on one work and start filling out the TEDx applications.


## Personnel

Taylor Conroy has developed ""How To Land A TEDx Talk & Spread Your Message To Millions In The Next 30 Days."" training. The ""tuition covers that 30 days and then he continues to mentor one on one for 12 months after. He has put together a team of trainers. Travis Connover is my contact that I have interviewed with and will be working closely with.


## Roadmap and milestones

Taylor's team fills out the first 20 applications to land a TEDx talk within 30 days. I will document and update via a blog/vlog/social media channels but will write personalized letters to the community and any donors that help me reach this goal. In addition to the micro-updates, I will send a ""highlights"" update discussing the progress on macro-level every 30 days and will provide access to my trainers and mentors to send updates and communicate, and answer any questions from any of those responsible for helping me reach my goals. Be they good things or bad things about my progress.

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Decentrapolooza will be a regular Decentraland convention event that allows citizens of Decentraland to gather together as artists, technologists, gamers and innovators.

The event will provide structured speaker panel sessions as an opportunity to present past, present and future projects and topics of interest.

The event will invite high profile individuals from industries such as academia, business and entertainment to participate as guests and panelists.

With a focus on decentralisation the event will celebrate the experimental application of technology in a virtual world that is limited only by imagination.

## Description

The recent pandemic has emphasised the growing need for virtual events.  By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.

Many global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in.

The event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.  Categories will include areas such as Gaming, Content Development, Platform Development and Community Development.

This project will also aim to build academic interest.  By collecting and making data available for research purposes (such as the text transcription of all panel sessions) the project allows for spin-off data science studies.  For example, with the application of machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)) data scientists may analyse all the session's text transcriptions to perform topic classification.  Topic classification may be able to identify common points of interest and proposed solutions throughout the whole event.  These studies could provide great insight into best directed future developments in Decentraland.


## Specification

This project will depend heavily on open source and shared resources accessible from the GitHub repositories and Decentraland community.  The approach will be to utilise what is already available before building anything new.

The University District and its already established structures such as Decentraland University and Learning Spheres, will make for a suitable location to run this event, though some additional development is foreseen as necessary.

A small research study will be performed to identify the feasibility of all existing reusable resources for this event.  The outcome of the research study will report a detailed plan of implementation using agile and iterative development methodologies.

Necessary modifications and additions to scenes/features will be developed through the Decentraland SDK and 3D modelling software (such as Blender).  This project will contribute to the open-source code repositories.

Already identified existing [GitHub](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes) resources include:

*   Wearables-store
*   Crypto-valley-art-gallery
*   Clap-meter
*   POAP-Booth
*   Nft-scanner
*   Ws-broadcast
*   Switchboard-platforms
*   Grab-objects
*   Guest-Book-API
*   Beer-dispenser
*   Donations-Box
*   Paid-Button

*   Events-API
*   Digital-bouncer
*   Basic-Interactions
*   Grab-objects-advanced
*   discordWebsocket
*   Nft-wall-example-scene

Experience has been gained in using the SDK and deploying dcl scenes to local development environments.


## Personnel

This project will be managed by [Troy Sadkowsky](https://www.google.com/search?q=troy+sadkowsky), CTO and Data Scientist at [Data Logical Services Pty Ltd](https://datalogicalservices.com/).  Troy is a native data scientist and the owner of the Data Scientist group on LinkedIn which currently has over 100,000 members.  Troy is also a full-stack Java developer with extensive experience in npm and TypeScript programming.  He is moderately skilled in 3D modelling with Blender.

With the successful award of this grant, a small team of enthusiastic technologists will be assembled and given necessary roles and responsibilities in order to achieve the project goals.


## Roadmap and milestones

Month 1 - Planning Phase
Month 2 - Development Phase
Month 3 - Trial and Promotion Phase

Planning phase will involve the recruitment of the team, the execution of the research study into reusable resources for this event and the documentation of the overall event management plan.  Milestone deliverables include the public release of the event management plan.

Development Phase will involve the design and development of any additional components to be deployed to the scenes in Decentraland.  Milestone deliverables include the announcement and deployment of any new Decentrapolooza scenes/features.

Trial and Promotion Phase will involve testing and running trial/rehearsal events to identify any issues and establish confidence for all stakeholders before the actual event is run.  This phase will also involve the execution of numerous marketing campaigns to promote the event.

All phases will include research and investigation into ongoing funding opportunities, such as charging for tickets/exhibitor booths and getting support from paying sponsors.

All progress related to the phases and milestones will be regularly reported openly on social networking platforms such as YouTube, Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

Hello, Residents of Decentraland ~

This poll requests the ability for L2 wearables Creators to publish items to an existing wearables collection that they manage. This will allow Creators to expand existing collections within their 'brand' without having to plan and create every item within the collection beforehand. Of course, additions to existing collections would still require the same review by the Wearables Committee as any other item would prior to being published to the metaverse.

The reason for suggesting such an improvement is to allow for future expansion to existing collections, as well as to keep the collections within the marketplace and in-game wardrobes relatively organized. There are already Creators with a handful of separate published collections that may be better suited to live all in one collection, if the system allowed to add to existing contracts.

Ease of technological implementation aside, this poll constitutes a community ' 'temperature check' to get the issue out into the world and start discussing quality of life improvements such as these. Thank you for considering this request.

- Yes, allow Creators to publish new wearables to their existing collections.
- No, continue to require Creators to make a new collection with each wearables submission.

15972,15972,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Should the Curation Committee receive a Compensation for their work?,"> by 0x00d0e85cad26ce0f456db566721346cc4d2fd44c (Deliverator)

### Abstract:

To incentivize members of the curation committee, we need to compensate them for their time and contributions.

### Need

The Wearables Curation Committee was formed to help ensure that all published wearables are technically sound before they are minted on Polygon and made permanently available to users.

The Curation committee is also tasked with identifying and flagging any submissions that may violate Decentraland's Content Policy and Terms of Use. These submissions are not to be vetted by the Committee but are instead passed onto the DAO for final approval or rejection. The ""handing off"" process for these submissions still takes effort and time from the Committee members.

In order to incentivize committee members to do this work, they need to be compensated fairly. Failing to compensate the Curation Committee will result in faster turn-over within the committee, and (likely) a subsequent decrease in the volume and quality of minted wearables.

### Approach

People who submit Decentraland wearables for publication must pay a fee of 500 MANA per item in each collection submitted. A portion of these fees needs to be used to compensate the committee.

I suggest that each committee member be compensated at an initial rate of $30 USD per item processed, regardless of whether the item is approved or rejected. These payments can be made in MANA by the DAO Committee on a monthly basis. Retroactive payments should be executed to compensate the committee for work they've done since June 1.

According to this query on the Graph, the committee has published 135 separate collections for a total of 299 items since the launch of the Wearables Editor on June 1, 2021 (as of the time of writing on July 15th). This total includes all submissions, including those that are rejected.

With the publication fee set at 500 MANA per item, the DAO has collected 149,500 MANA between June 1 and July 15.

During the previous 45 days, this averages to:

*   1 collection / day / committee member
*   2.21 items / day / committee member

At the suggested rate of $30 USD/item/committee member, each member would receive a rough average of $1989 USD / month (based on the previous 45 days worth of data).

### Benefit

Basing compensation on the number of items processed has several benefits:

*   Each month, running a Graph query to calculate the amount of MANA to transfer to the committee members is simple and efficient
*   The data that each month's compensation is based off is transparent and public for the community
*   Starting at $30 USD per item leaves room to grow the committee, and increase the number of wearables processed

- Compensate Curators -  30 USD p/item
- Compensate Curators - Find another rate
- No compensation for Curators

The current DCL's Map is pullulated by a lot of empty POIs. You can spot them as ""Empty Parcel"".
This happen very often when there is no scene or the owner has not renamed their scenes.

Without remove the POI (because it may be a mistake). The Map should not display a POI with a default scene name. Then if the owner renames it, the POI will appear again.

The original purpose of the 500k vp count for a POI proposal to get implemented was to limit the number of POI's on the map, because a map that's too cluttered is not useful.

Now the only projects who get POI's are ones backed by whales.  This isn't consistent with the supposed ethos of DCL, and it's not limiting the # of POI's.

I propose putting a hard cap on POI's, and make them into NFT's so they are tradable on OpenSea and other marketplaces.

Another option would be to make them rentable like land, which might be more attractive in the long run.

Full disclosure:  I was one of the last to get one before the 500k cutoff.

[In Decentraland, should we make name plates 25% larger and name text 25% larger and yellow for minted Decentraland Names, so that they are more visible than the non-minted names?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2a4dbc00-520e-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)

## Summary

Hello, i found this old pre-proposal.. Let's vote!

Would like to have longer DCL names.
Proposed 20-25 letters total


## Abstract

For those that have minted a Decentraland Name, I believe that the name plate in Decentraland should be more visible than the non-minted names. If we make the text a different color such as yellow and make the name plate and text slightly larger, it would make the minted names stand out more from the non-minted generic names.

Many of us have invested MANA into minting names and I believe that this would help to showcase our NFT Decentraland Names.


## Motivation

Motivation: More DCL names would be minted, and more revenue to DCL + more people flexing their new names.

Many last names are longer, than currently allowed. Would be awesome to have this extra feature.


## Specification

Rest can be found in pre-proposal


## Conclusion

Let's get longer names

**Summary**

Given the amount of MANA owned by the Decentraland DAO, we should diversify these holdings between Decentraland's native token (MANA) and stable coins to make the DAO&rsquo;s treasury more secure.

***The DAO should allocate one-fifth (1/5) of the treasury, or `6,115,643` MANA, to a portfolio of stable coins including equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.***

The added stability resulting from this diversification will better empower the DAO to fulfill its various financial obligations (e.g. the community grants program) over a longer period of time.

While the formation of a DAO Treasury Committee might result in a more complex and performant financial strategy, this initial proposal aims to suggest a simple change that our community can make right now to immediately help to protect and sustain the DAO's funding.

**Abstract**

On February 20, 2020, the Decentraland DAO was created and given 222 million MANA by means of a 10 year vesting contract. (Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the DAO's [vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding  decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO.

As of the time this proposal was published, `30,578,217` of that MANA has vested, and is now available to the DAO's treasury.

It is risky for the DAO to keep only MANA (its native governance token) in its treasury. To help guarantee that the treasury's balance remains wisely managed, the DAO's treasury should diversify across bluechip assets (e.g. ETH or BTC), stablecoins (e.g. DAI or USDC), and other assets such as a DeFi index (DPI) which may enable the DAO to earn yield.

Spreading the DAO's holdings across these different assets will help to stabilize the DAO's entire treasury in the face of market fluctuations.

Maintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community, e.g. grants. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49) specifies that each grant is to be paid in MANA, according to the exchange rate between USD and MANA at the time of the transaction.

Maintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.

Many other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.

*\*\*In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/5th of its treasury (or `6,115,643` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI. \*\**

The remaining 4/5ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.

**Specification**

1/5th of the DAO's existing treasury, or `6,115,643` MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, with to the following distribution:

*   `2,038,547.66` USDC
*   `2,038,547.66` USDT
*   `2,038,547.66` DAI

The transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig, requiring the signature of all three members.

**For**

Approve the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.

**Against**

Reject the proposed asset allocation.

First of all, the fee is quite high.
From what I see, at the moment selling something is more of a gamble than a sure thing.
On top of that, you have this fee and the possibility to literally trash 500 dollars for nothing.
I don't find this very fair.
I think that it would be much more fair that if the object is not approved, 4/5 of the fee is given back, while if the object is approved, the fee is kept in the DAO.

- I agree, high fee can't be lost this way.

15992,15992,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,To change the wearable category of Tiara to a more open category,"> by 0x64c3acab990222b78ae2abe30daaecfc092f8b9c (CRU5HED#8b9c)

As a creator I think it would make more sense to change the Tiara category to something more open - like 'Extras' 'Utility' or even 'Swag'- this would allow creators to have a broader-range category for items that do not fit into one of the other distinct wearable categories.

The Tiara category is already being used for all kinds of non-Tiara items, wings, shields, backpacks, wands and seems for simplicity's sake might be easier to either change the name of this slot or add a new category to give a slot for 'extra' items in the marketplace.

Would also be good to allow this category's items to be linked to any part of the body to give a broader range of options for creators and for the profile image to focus on the item itself (mainly an issue for the review process)

I feel this would improve the creative options for the DCL wearables community which is clearly one of the big attractions of DCL

15995,15995,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Add Laura Uson Dolsac to the Wearables Curation Committee,"> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)

**Summary**

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The [Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/) was formed to help with this process.

There are currently only three individuals sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the [call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047),  Laura Uson Dolsac was nominated:

""Laura is a lead artist and wearables designer for Polygonal Mind. With a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, Laura has been working on video games professionally since 2016. Since Decentralnd's launch in 2020, Laura has helped to build several successful scenes for projects including Momus Park, ABM, and most recently Etheremon and the Wondertech pledge.

While working for Polygonal Mind, Laura has built or contributed to many popular wearable collections. Notable examples include the Meme, Moebius, and BAYC collections. Laura is a skilled and thoughtful mentor, and has worked with numerous members of the Decentraland community to help them bring their wearables and creations into the world.""

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the [DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b) to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

As a new developer joining the DCL community I wanted to create wearables to run a business.

Quickly I found about the Wearable non-refundable Publication Fee that right now is set at 500 Mana ($1,590 with Mana at $3.18 at the time of writing this)

Because the price of MANA in October was around $0.80 this Publication Fee used to be around $400.

I propose to lower the current Publication Fee for Wearables to 150 MANA so the price in USD is what it used to be in October 2021.

My main drive to propose this change is because I feel that Decentraland Could have more stores where Clothing is for sale.

Fortnite Received 5 Billion USD of Revenue in 2020 mainly selling Skins so I feel Decentraland could be benefited from having more wearables sales.

I honestly don't see a downside on Updating the Publication Fee to 150 MANA(Around $400 USD as it was in October 2021).

In conclusion, I propose to lower the Publication Fee of Wearables to 150 Mana. This change could allow more developers to create wearables giving the users more options on what to wear and how they wish to express themselves.

- Lower Publication Fee to 150 MANA

I am going to be in the process of looking for land soon and just reaching out to land owners is very complicated. Can there be a simpler way? Can we message them in the marketplace where their assets are & attach the asset in message, so they know and get notifications while on the site. I had to airdrop a person a NFT saying, i am interested in his land and for him to add my discord. The seller and customer's communication bridge seems to be closed as of now.

Currently it's very difficult to tell exactly where a sound/voice is coming from when in DCL, and sounds seem to simply get louder the closer you are to them but are not spatial in the sense of utilizing stereo for directionality.

This proposal is to incorporate spatial audio functionality into Decentraland, perhaps using an open source library like https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/

Should creators be able to sell furniture in the Marketplace?  Allowing them to do so could help improve the visuals of DCL by incentivizing talented 3d modelers who don't own land to contribute.\
If we allow this, the specs need to be fairly strict in terms of optimizations.  The curators would need to keep an eye out for anything that hogs too much memory, fill rate, or draw calls.

### Motivation

Currently the **peer.decentraland.org** domain receives more than **2x** the amount of HTTP requests than the actual Load Balancer at **peer-lb.decentraland.org** (in charge of distributing the traffic across the catalyst network). This is caused by several external services targeting directly this server URL and not leveraging the catalyst network. As a result if there is a problem with this node, all services depending on it and consuming data from there will face problems too and, on the other hand, this node is using a lot of extra resources in order to respond to those requests.

### HTTP requests qty in 1 week received by Host - January 2022

| Host                                                                     | Requests                    |

| peer-lb.decentraland.org                         | 75.5M                         |

### Proposal

*   Change the current Catalyst server domain name from **peer.decentraland.org** to **peer-ec2.decentraland.org**.
*   Make **peer.decentraland.org** be the Load Balancer while also keeping **peer-lb.decentraland.org** (as DNS CNAME). These 2 Domains will distribute the requests in the Catalysts network.

### Impact

*   Everything will keep working as it is.
*   The change will be transparent, no updates will be required in external services or apps
*   Higher Availability and Security for any App depending on the Catalysts Servers
*   All services hitting **peer.decentraland.org** will end up leveraging the decentralized network, avoiding potential failures
*   When doing an HTTP request to **peer.decentraland.org** or **peer-lb.decentraland.org**, the request will be distributed across the Catalyst Servers
*   The Catalyst with the new domain name **peer-ec2.decentraland.org** will receive an equitative amount of HTTP requests, releasing a lot of HW resources from that node and with that it will better serve the users connected to it.

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

We are looking to create the world's first health education platform on the metaverse.

Led by British doctors from a variety of health specialties (including general practitioners, medical physicians, orthopedics/sports medicine, ophthalmology and psychiatry), we want to empower Decentraland's users with education and support on a variety of health issues - with a particular focus on mental health.

We envisage to run live weekly educational events on current, important and community-chosen medical topics. These will be led by doctors and consultants with particular expertise in that field. We aim for these events to be highly interactive and therefore highly valuable for the participants.


## Grant size

200,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x4748629B341aE21D5009Ae425DFa79e9Fd852282

## Description

What we hope to achieve;

Solving health inequalities;

*   Access to expertise across several fields of medicine, psychiatry and surgery, who will provide health education to the users of Decentraland (no matter where in the world you are from)

Improving health;

*   Focussing on key health issues, we can aim to improve and empower users, through education, to make healthy choices and understand more about disease and medicine

Mental health support;

*   With access to psychiatrists and psychologists, we will have a particular focus on mental health education and support. We know this is a key issue globally, and in particular amidst the global pandemic.

Community driven;

*   We want to ensure we are delivering and catering to the needs of the community. We will ensure that the direction of our educational events are driven by the community, and focussed on the areas that matter the most to you.

How we hope to achieve this;

*   Weekly live educational events
    Each week there will be a doctor led event, where education on a particular health topic will be delivered to the community. These will be interactive, and include dedicated time for questions and answers.

*   Dedicated sessions on mental health
    Delivered by psychiatrists/psychologists, we will have sessions dedicated purely for mental health support and chats.

*   A list of trusted health professionals
    We will continue to build on our bank of trusted healthcare professionals, all of whom will be fully registered and indemnified by their national medical councils.

The future aims of the project;

We are hoping to expand our project to run virtual medical clinics for the users of Decentraland. This will mean that you can access a one on one appointment with a fully trained and indemnified doctor/nurse for health advice/management.

There are several legal and indemnity requirements that need to be addressed in order for this to become a reality, and we hope that these can be worked out sooner rather than later (watch this space!)... this will be a world's first in the Metaverse.


## Specification

We are already in a unique position to access a wide number of leading experts in healthcare and medicine, to deliver excellent health education events.

With the funds raised from the grant, we will look to hire a programmer and developer to build and maintain a space within Decentraland to run our educational events.

The funds will also be utilised to pay for the health professionals time during the educational events. We envisage that this will cover weekly events across a one year time frame, after which we will seek additional investment to continue our work.

Any surplus funds will be utilised to invest in the future of the project, in particular seeking appropriate legal advice, and building the necessary framework for building the World's first Metaverse virtual doctor clinics.


## Personnel

*   Project Lead - Dr I Farooqi
    UK based General Practitioner, qualified in 2014. Clinical education lead, Clinical Supervisor, and Covid Vaccination Lead.

*   Contributing doctors - Dr Bhuta (psychiatrist), Dr Knox (orthopedics), Dr Nathan (general medicine), Dr Aziz (ophthalmology)

*   Additional contributors within the fields of psychology, sports medicine, trained counsellors, and physicians associates.

*   We will look to hire a programmer/developer with experience of the Decentraland user interface and platform. This will be needed to create the required platform within Decentraland to enable our weekly educational events.

*   Community contributors.
    We would like to onboard some key contributors from the Decentraland community to help drive our project forward.


## Roadmap and milestones

Month 1

*   Purchase the necessary space within Decentraland platform
*   Recruit an experienced programmer/developer to work on the Decentraland platform

Month 2-4

*   Create a usable and highly functional space within the platform, for our educational events
*   Create a schedule for the educational events and mental health support events, booking in the necessary health professionals to deliver the weekly events.
*   Recruit some key community contributors to help define the above schedule

Month 5

*   Launch!

Month 6 onwards

*   Following launch we will work hard to drive additional revenue and investment into the project so that we can begin to look into creation of virtual doctor clinics, for more personal and bespoke clinical care.

Hello,
I am not the first to think of this proposal. However, I wanted to be the voice of the community. As we all know the only reasoning you are able to receive any type of voting power is through the purchase of Names, Mana, or Land/Estates. It's difficult to have decentralized form of governance if the opinions of a few can have decisions over the many. I have seen numerous proposals with 60-100+ yes proposals getting turned down, because 1-2 people vote no with VP that was delegated to them. What we are trying to build shouldn't just be based of the decisions of the elite few, it should come from the voice of the people.
For example, why should the opinion of someone who was delegated 1 million VP that doesn't even log into DCL dictate the choices, and the voice of the community of 60+ others that do, or actively try to grow, and make DCL a better Metaverse?
For those reasons, I am proposing that we implement a system to add more VP into the game, and more ways to accrue such points.

1.  Accrual of VP based on time spent in DCL In-game. This can be done by counting activity spent in the Metaverse as a time translation to VP. For example, what if you logged into DCL, and were active either by participating in activities, social experiences, ICE Poker, and others etc. Whether it's a certain allotted amount of time, or maybe days this seems like a fair exchange of governance say for those involved.

2.  Creation of Wearables. As many of you know, it costs 100 mana to create a wearable submission. This is the same cost as a name, so why shouldn't you received VP in the same sense? This should equate to 1/4 the cost aka 25 VP per wearable you create. It's smaller than the names, but you have a chance to make mana off of sales, so this seems like a fair trade.

3.  Participation in Governance Voting. Those who vote, regardless of their VP, should be able to reach a threshold of earning VP, for helping out the governance body. This would encourage a more diverse opinion of many in DCL, and hopefully increase participation on the DAO.

These are 3 such ways we can help to improve our governance system, and the future of Decentraland in general! I look forward to your opinions! Thank you!

## Abstract

I would like to have a reasonably big piece of land. On the land I will have a place for me which will be very small and humble. Gardening and a little farming. But also on the property I’d like to have an educational building and gift curator store.

## Abstract

The fact is the world is changing. Me and a few like minded individuals are starting a company to educate both ourselves and the community about Nft's cyrpto currency and the metaverse. we intend on acquiring the most influential and long lasting aspects of these new technologies familiarizing ourselves with them and hosting both real world and in verse events to help people understand what all these things actually are. we aren't geniuses, billionaires, or avid gamers though we do have a passion for these things and though their is a lot we don't know theirs a lot we do compares to the average community at large. we want to be the bridge between cutting edge and the consumer so the things that are out their get to the indented user.

239,999 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x32c03a3e1f5c7A42D504E1083cAE7E56d7060b36

## Description

As stated prior we both intend to educate ourselves on tech as much as we intend to teach others. and out of the our big 3 subjects, crypto, NFT's, and metaverse, metaverse is our least knowledgeable area. we would use our grant to at first get better acquainted with all aspects of decentraland. provide community events and completions with reward both in the real world.

Our end goal is to host real world conventions with fully educated and informed partners and companies to introduce people who are intimidated  by all the new tech and help them understand it. guest speakers, content creators, and developers, and classes. As a whole we believe theirs a lot of money to be made, yes very true. More importantly their is utility and potential for the average person to succeed and grow a community.

Barbershop should give discounts to a specific nft holder of their own making, crypto can help businesses efficiency speed and metaverse is going to be where  people are at. but their are so many things possible and we genuinely believe it all starts with metaverse and Decantraland seems like a good fit for us.

Because of the technical nature of Decentaland its the most expensive to teach the amount of equipment we would need is a debate at this point. however we do know most people already own computers teaching them about crypto or nft's doesn't need any extra hardware. our focus would shift to decentraland and utilizing it for both showing the world its own capabilities but its auditory and visual capabilities make it ideal for eduating in general. if people new how to use metaverse, the covid homeschooling issue would have been virtually solved(pun not intended).

we believe whole heatedly there are a lot of problems in the world that already have solutions. People just don't know where to look for the answers. yes we want to  make money, yes success is our dream. But we are driven by our passion help and inform the community, and not by solving their problems, but by showing them the solution was already out there. you just have to learn about a few things to find it


## Specification

we have a warehouse and office space dedicated to increasing our team, educating staff and storing event equipment and merchandise. our day to day consists of connecting with communities on social media and metaverse platforms promoting and providing content educating the average person. our real world events will be less frequent maybe bi weekly or monthly over the weekend after we are more established we can increase and expand

We are located in California close to l.a. so we are in a good area to start and we want to be nation wide have a team online and a team touring around. The touring team would host real world and  social media competitions and planned A.R.G. 's.

the online team would be involved in args as well, but more focused on the platform and utilize decentraland and the online conveniences to improve the communities understanding for the technology.

In short the in person events are for people who really don't know about this crypto, nft, meta thingy, and the online events are for those who want to utilize it the best they can. we just need the ability to provide the info and educate our staff on everything.

## Description

We need a place where anyone inside and **outside** the Decentraland-community can suggest ideas for events and projects for games, artistic projects, and land-projects inside Decentraland. This is a crowdsourcing and -voting platform that encourages and inspires collaboration of existing and new stakeholders and new project ideas and partnerships.

This is different than the already existing DAO-community voting as this platform will be **open and public** and is inviting interested people that want to participate in Decentraland by either contributing ideas and/or resources.

**Goals:** Having built the open platform and having engaged 30 people that have co-organized or participated in community events and/or collaborative projects.


## Specification

Please see the following links to videos, prototypes and the white paper and also the section *""Roadmap and milestones""* below for further details.

A) 1.5-minute interview of Simon explaining what Favourse is: https://video.favourse.com/
On www.Favourse.com you can find overview, short explainer videos with main use cases, links to telegram-groups, team, etc.
C) https://demo.favourse.com - Demo (view-only) related to the main use cases referenced in the explainer videos
D) https://pre.favourse.com - Prototype, can register with few clicks, play around
E) https://whitepaper.favourse.com - White paper

We are happy to provide further information regarding details about the technical implementation. The current prototype was built in Laravel (PHP, Javascript, etc.), though once awarded the grant, we will re-evaluate if and if yes, what part of the current prototype could be re-used. Also, we would be happy to hear feedback and suggestions from the community and potentially re-use already existing code and tools.

**2. + 3. Month**: Erik & Sadu (development), together with Iosi & Imad (UI and design), define and start development of the first version with core elements of suggesting, voting, trending-view and tag-search.

**4. Month**: Launch of first version and opening up for registrations to users, asking already contacted prospects to register and start using the protype.

**5. Month**: Have 1 event or collaborative land-project that was suggested, voted for and organized on the platform.

**6. Month**: Have 5 events or collaborative land-projects that were suggested, voted for and organized on the platform.

*An iteration of the project could involve allowing people to vote with their wallets or use MANA to vote and/or to fund projects/ideas/events.*

**Key Metrics**
Number of people that participated: 50
Number of idea-events or collaborative land-projects created: 20

It would be beneficial to be able to tag items on the marketplace for later purchase.  This way buyers could easily shop for items over time.  This would function like a wish list so when a buyer returns to the marketplace they can easily locate those items they have been ""thinking"" about buying and are now ready to complete the purchase.  I'm not sure of any way to currently do this.

Multiple customizable lists would be great for shopping organization.

It would also be helpful to be able to make your wish lists available for others to see if you desire (gift registries) for birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, donations, etc.  I would settle for having the lists private, but I would like the option to make them public somehow.

It would also be nice to be able to bundle multiple items into a single purchase (shopping cart), but I'm not sure if that is possible.  Then maybe we could convert a list into a single order for multiple items.

due to the massive increase in interest, the price of mana has increased to the point where if someone new wants to create a wearable it will cost them $2500~. This is limiting the amount of creativity that is possible within dcl. So I propose that the cost to mint is reduced is lowered to 50 mana but will scale as follows: 2nd mint 100 mana, 3rd mint 250 mana, 4th mint 500 mana at which it will be capped. This should help to kick start smaller creators and will mean that only the most creative/entertaining creators become successful. Doing this Should overall create a profit for the DAO as although the price is cheaper it will encourage more people to get creating

### Description

While the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.

There are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.

To help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.

**The candidate**

After the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, AndreusAs (<https://sketchfab.com/AndreusAs/models>), 3D Artist and independent wearable creator was nominated:

<https://market.decentraland.org/accounts/0xa8c7d5818a255a1856b31177e5c96e1d61c83991?assetType=item&section=wearables>

**Compensation**

On August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.  This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.

Committee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.

**Necessary qualifications**

Curation Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):

*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation
*   A full understanding of skin weighting
*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here
*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline
*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO
*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions

Just in the same manner that land is bought and sold, should there be a similar mechanism on the market.decentraland.org that provides listings to be made with permissions clearly displayed which enable builders and creators to 'rent' and utilize land through deployment permission (for a scheduled timeframe)?

MANA used to pay out these contracts can be subject to the same marketplace fee as regular land sales. This can provide added value to Decentraland assets, create a better free market concept for land rental, draw more talent as well as entrepreneurship and traffic to Decentraland, etc.

Points of Interest (or POIs) are a great way for users to explore and learn about cool places inside Decentraland. Right now the Decentraland project is maintaining two lists of POIs:

*   Foundation maintained list, the first implementation of POIs (Legacy POI List).
*   DAO maintained list, updated by the DAO Committee after a governance proposal for adding or removing a POI is approved.

This **creates an unnecessary complexity** by having to maintain two lists and prevents the DAO community from removing POIs that are defined on the legacy list by using the POI Removal proposal type.

On a more philosophical level, having a POI list embedded on the World Explorer (aka. Reference Client) **goes against the principle of decentralization and community ownership** of the project since another client wouldn't be able to use that list.

### A simple but expensive solution

We could simply migrate all POIs from the Legacy POI List to the DAO maintained one. However the legacy list has 90 POIs, and adding all those by an on-chain transaction will have an estimated gas fee of 200 USD each, **totaling a ~$18.000 USD expense to keep those POIs**

Legacy POI List: https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json (See the [spreadsheet version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdjojNKYUOLt-5v2KHnE4-9IFR5zjsUhqckRNVdNX2o/edit#gid=1503583878) with POI names)

This pre-proposal Poll aims to gather community feedback on the next steps. If any of the YES options get selected, this will become a DRAFT proposal for the community to vote on.

- Yes, delete the legacy list and let the community vote for the POIs that should be re-added to the DAO maintained list
- Yes, delete the legacy list and make the DAO pay for adding the 90 legacy POIs
- No, maintain both lists

We propose that the DAO reimburse the secondary royalty fees of all creators who had secondary sales in between Monday, September 6th 2021 (when the [change in secondary sales proposal was passed](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b70c59d0-09c5-11ec-a4d1-8d5d2cba0825)) and Tuesday, December 14th (when the DCL Marketplace Contract was updated to automatically divert payments to wearables creators).

A list of all total due to each creator can be found here: https://atlascorp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTyvcJqbyJuGWmCpsvUEU19uQ6cb17bWgYBRjQC1aECBq/overview.csv

The same IPFS directory contains a list of individual sales that aggregate to the totals here: https://atlascorp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTyvcJqbyJuGWmCpsvUEU19uQ6cb17bWgYBRjQC1aECBq

These totals were calculated using the DCL Wearables Analytics application, built as a result of [a DAO Grant proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=97eeea20-40b8-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5).

## Description

I have been on the crypto/blockchain journey for a little over 3 years (seriously for 2) and I can't believe how many people are still so reticent to take the plunge. My intent is once I have a platform with which to ""inspire and influence"" people (not to be arrogant) I hope to help brick and mortars make the transition to blockchain and online literacy.  I have an old-school mentality with a forward/future-looking mindset. I refuse to play by anyone else rules for the sake of decorum. I refuse to live according to any labels, titles, and roles that I disagree with either morally or philosophically. I am whole, healthy, and a force to be reckoned with, I will not go quietly into that good night. I will help tear down this infernal machine brick by brick, bringing it all down on my head if I must. I will not let this garbage be passed on to my children. Help me.


## Specification

Pay the ""tuition"" for the Life Coach and his team. I have already had a final interview, just waiting to raise the funding to begin the one on one work and start filling out the TEDx applications.


## Personnel

Taylor Conroy has developed ""How To Land A TEDx Talk & Spread Your Message To Millions In The Next 30 Days."" training. The ""tuition covers that 30 days and then he continues to mentor one on one for 12 months after. He has put together a team of trainers. Travis Connover is my contact that I have interviewed with and will be working closely with.


## Roadmap and milestones

Taylor's team fills out the first 20 applications to land a TEDx talk within 30 days. I will document and update via a blog/vlog/social media channels but will write personalized letters to the community and any donors that help me reach this goal. In addition to the micro-updates, I will send a ""highlights"" update discussing the progress on macro-level every 30 days and will provide access to my trainers and mentors to send updates and communicate, and answer any questions from any of those responsible for helping me reach my goals. Be they good things or bad things about my progress.

## Description

Today the metaverse is the main topic of discussion. Governments are talking about regulations, while big companies are showing interest in building representative offices in metaverses, especially in Decentraland.

Our main goal in Maff Media - is to educate people and show them the possibilities of a metaverse. The team explores new features and objects and studies the news daily. We bring the metaverse into the mass by translating hard for understanding topics in plain language. We successfully did it in the Russian language and now would like to proceed with doing the content in English.

We will focus on the possibilities of Decentraland that will popularize the metaverse between users.

For that, we need to hire additional English-speaking editors and translators. As it is independent media and we don't sell any ad in it we need some financial support to make the content about the Decentraland in English.


## Specification

During 3 months we will do:

We will translate 8 videos about Decentraland
We will create 12 new videos about Decentraland in English

Examples of the content we have made

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Over the last year our team at Serraform has been fully committed to supporting the Decentraland ecosystem with a fully managed, enterprise grade, adaptive video streaming service. We’ve successfully worked through all the challenges of streaming into the Decentraland for events of all shapes and sizes, and are now ready to take it to the next level.

We believe that streaming audio and video into Decentraland should be as easy as posting on Facebook, and as flexible as Lego blocks. With your support, we can provide the “remote” you need to drive content at scale with no limits, no buffering, and no jitter.

We need a Decentraland-first streaming platform that enables any streaming need, and one that can grow with our community.

## Description

Streaming limitless events with the best user experience requires global CDN networks with a massive amount of bandwidth that can scale in real-time; something most of us just don’t have access to. The answer is simply to harness the power of the cloud, efficiently and securely.

With a combined 30+ years of experience in cloud consulting with some of the largest fortune 500 companies through infrastructure, development, automation, and cybersecurity. Not to mention we’re a strong player within the community – Serraform is uniquely positioned to deliver a self-service video streaming platform for Decentraland that is fully-automated and simple to use.

With your support, we plan to further invest in the development of a streaming platform hosted in the cloud and secured with state-of-the-art cybersecurity and compliant solutions. To do this we need to take what we’ve learned and built so far and automate its ability to service you at a moment’s notice. We need the service to scale beyond what our team can manage and let anybody use it themselves when they want, while reducing overall running costs for the community.

We need to develop an interface and an API that can be used for any parcel owner to leverage the power of our streaming platform, allowing the ability for users to upload any audio/video file for streaming, or copy/paste in a Twitch/YouTube stream URL for those who prefer that route. We also know the community wants to broadcast Zoom podcasts or OBS streams directly into Decentraland but lack the ability to do it at scale and without jitter – we've been servicing all these use-cases, and now we need to package it up in a simple to use service for anybody to use on their own time. Simply upload your video, paste your link, or request a RTMP URL/key and let the fully automated service handle the rest.

If you’re a developer you might build an interface inside Decentraland or within your own tool if you prefer not to use ours, then leverage our API to deliver on the streaming magic for you. Rent out your venue and allow guests to control their content natively inside your own parcel. Have a club night where your VIP guests control the stream via Twitch or a jukebox collection of content over a stream deck you built! The possibilities will be endless, and this is just the beginning.

**Feature highlights PowerPoint:** https://tinyurl.com/5b58ccx9


## Specification

We plan to develop this solution on Microsoft Azure cloud using fully automated code to provision isolated streaming “tenants” using modern DevOps practices. We believe the solution should be cloud-native and have no single points of failure or need for manual intervention, while being able to deliver on your security and compliance needs with maximum horsepower and optimum user experience across the globe.

In addition to our proposed website UI, we plan to develop an API ‘under the hood’ to allow 3rd party app integration, allowing anybody to integrate their own parcel and control preferences with our streaming solution, either in-game or through 3rd party tooling or websites. **Why not build your own jukebox collection and let party-goers control your screens within your parcel? Imagine building a stream deck inside your venue!**

The content will be encoded with H.264 studio-grade quality up to 1080p, optimized for Decentraland events, and securely stored using Microsoft’s award-winning Defender security toolset. The streams will be provided as adaptive M3U8 streams, meaning various bitrates and resolutions will be available, accommodating any bandwidth limitations – this basically means **you get a buffer-free experience on every stream at the best quality possible anywhere and on any device**.

The service will support ingestion of any external stream (via OBS or Zoom for example) using an RTMP URL/key pair, but also **be able to broadcast streams directly from Twitch and/or YouTube** if you already have a URL.

We plan to leverage Verizon’s global premium CDN network allowing for dedicated content delivery to anybody around the world at very low latency and zero buffering. We want to be able to ingest any video source, and re-broadcast it directly into Decentraland, providing a **great viewing experience for over 1700+ user events. No more skipping OBS streams for large audiences!**

We currently offer this as a service, and we manage it ourselves on behalf of our customers. The goal now is to take your needs and our solution and develop a fully automated backend streaming platform that is self-serviceable by you via our website/API and doesn’t require our team to manage any aspect of it other than growing it based on your continued feedback. **We want to scale this working solution and reduce the costs overall for the entire Decentraland community, while making it far more versatile for anybody to leverage.**

## Abstract

An in-world DAO headquarters where users participate in discussions, review proposals, cast votes, and archive past DAO decisions as a constitution. This public forum of governance is open to all members of the community all the time and hosts meetups, roundtables, regular town halls, and other DAO events.

The headquarters are being built by core contributors to the DAO community with ideas and feedback from many stakeholders in the DAO, Foundation, and creator community.

## Description

The Decentraland DAO lives and breathes through discussion, communication, and community building.

1.  KevinOnEarth proved the need and effectiveness of regular town hall discussion events-but we need a more stable and featureful forum to host them.

2.  The DAO Governance Snapshot web interface is great for voting but lacks discussion and commenting. An in-world presentation of the Snapshot space allows users to process and read proposals in the context that the proposals govern, instead of an abstract interface-necessarily a more engaging experience. The Decentraland DAO will be the first DAO to conduct avatar-based 3D governance discussion and voting.

3.  Activity in the #dao channel and #town-hall channels in Decentraland+ discord proves the community need for ad-hoc discussion places.

4.  Finally, out of principle, the DAO must have a presence in the world that it governs.

Initially, the scene will be hosted in a district. In the future, we'll explore proposing the purchase of LAND for DAO-related scenes as the DAO gains power.

As a jewelry brand trying to create necklace wearables I believe that a unique necklace category should be created. Currently we have to put necklaces under the Earrings category which doesn't make much sense since necklaces are innately more popular items than earrings and should have their own category. Also we are currently forced to include earrings in our necklace wearables and promote them as ""earrings"" for them to even be approved.

Dreamers dream and builders build. I am both! I have been a everyday gamer since I was 14 years old. Now 39, I have 3 wonderful kids (2,9,&12) that are gamers with the little one catching up fast to be a future gamer. Due to my old Laptop (2017) Been having major issues playing Decentraland, as far as I got was jumping into the portal after the tutorial. I don't have a strong enough graphics in my laptop to play. This grant would enable me and my kids to purchase a Gamer PC. I have always used PS, Wii, oculus...etc., in the past with no need for a gaming PC. Not being able to afford a Gaming PC means not playing Decentraland and not being able to contribute. I would contribute in every way possible. I have $100 usd in Mana stored in my coinbase account waiting for my family and I to play. I have contributed in ever venture that stands beside me to the max. Unfortunately without this grant might it be years before we will experience the future of gaming Decentraland. Thank you for your time.


## Specification

I will use 100% of funds in buying a computer to run and contribute in decentraland. First i would buy  Alienware Aurora R10 Ryzen 1400-1700. Any funds left will buy accessories like mouse keyboard and screen. In the past I have built PCs for friends, apon thinking more I believe the smartest idea is to buy it already built. As soon as I have the PC I will run decentraland and contribute any and everyway possible.


## Personnel

Myself Allen, my daughter Azalea with my son Jacob. I have been working on NFTs on https://crypto.com/nft/profile/atheistalien. Everyday player of Call of Duty, and F1 2021 and so many others.


## Roadmap and milestones

Purchase Gamer Pc, purchase accessories. Log into my decentraland account and create name/avatar purchase land and build. Contribute every cent of whatever money I receive left i will put back in Decentraland and Mana

16067,16067,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Adding VP for Wearable Creations DCL,"> by 0xae8bf49b1f8d56061bc693b7841c785b8e903ec5 (Turtles)

""This was idea was featured in an earlier poll of mine, and it caught a lot of traction. I would love to hear the community's response.""

Hello, I am not the first to think of this proposal. However, I wanted to be the voice of the community. As we all know the only reasoning you are able to receive any type of voting power is through the purchase of Names, Mana, or Land/Estates. It's difficult to have decentralized form of governance if the opinions of a few can have decisions over the many. I have seen numerous proposals with 60-100+ yes proposals getting turned down, because 1-2 people vote no with VP that was delegated to them. What we are trying to build shouldn't just be based of the decisions of the elite few, it should come from the voice of the people. For example, why should the opinion of someone who was delegated 1 million VP that doesn't even log into DCL dictate the choices, and the voice of the community of 60+ others that do, or actively try to grow, and make DCL a better Metaverse? For those reasons, I am proposing that we implement a system for giving creators of wearables VP

Creation of Wearables. As many of you know, it costs 100 mana to create a wearable submission. This is the same cost as a name, so why shouldn't you received VP in the same sense? This should equate to 1/4 the cost aka 25 VP per wearable you create. It's smaller than the names, but you have a chance to make mana off of sales, so this seems like a fair trade.

Thank you!

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Gladio-Digital is building a comprehensive DEFI, crypto, and NFT art education platform based on Polygon with the goal of on-boarding an additional 100,000 metaverse players within 3 years. We seek to create a gamified education program within Decentraland and on Polygon, allowing new users an easy way to learn and create within the Decentraland ecosystem. We are a team of 5, including a professional artist, coding devs, education content developers, and DEFI/Crypto educator.

Ultimately, we seek to create an entire sub-world within decentraland that quickly onboards and educates non-native crypto users, and then exposes them to the rest of the amazing opportunities that Decentraland provides. Duc in Altum!

16075,16075,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Reimburse gas fees to DAO Committee Members,"> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc

### Summary

Reimburse gas fees spent by DAO Committee Members when enacting transactions for the DAO.

### Abstract

The DAO Committee is responsible for sending on-chain transactions in order to update Decentraland’s Smart Contracts.

Everytime a votation about Catalyst, POI, Ban and Grants passes, we send two transactions to the Aragon’s DAO contract in order to enact the proposal. The first transaction creates the action on the DAO and we have to wait 24 hours before we can send a second transaction to execute it. This delay period was included for security, during that time the action can be paused by any DAO committee or SAB member.

These two transactions have significant gas costs measured in ETH. The fee is extracted from the wallet sending the transaction, the DAO Committee Member’s wallet.

There are other cases in which the members of the DAO Committee also spend gas, for example deploying vesting contracts and transferring the ownership of them to the DAO. Some polls may also require the Committee to take on-chain action which incurs in gas fees.

The addresses of the DAO Committee are:

*   0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc (Yemel)
*   0xBef99f5f55CF7cDb3a70998C57061B7e1386a9b0 (HPrivakos)
*   0x3323B7264F7D5e8f98e6aFCcec73b6bA1116AE19 (Eric)

### Motivation

I’m the one who has sent more transactions in the group. To the moment I have sent 98 transactions and spent 1.033 ETH in gas fees. Here is the  [list of transactions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4QIX1oflPVd4\_5zS8AZmkIHQA4numma6m5mWMBCdu4/edit?usp=sharing)  downloaded from  <https://fees.wtf/> . Note that I only use this address for my DAO Committee role.

### Specification

This proposal is to allow the monthly reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members. The reimbursement will be calculated by the DAO Committee and the operation will be noted in the next bi-weekly report.

This might only be necessary as a temporary stop-gap measure. In an ideal scenario, DAO Committee members shouldn’t be paying gas costs nor doing manual accounting tasks. This kind of operation should be solved by automation and better infrastructure.

### Vote

*   **For**: Approve the recurrent reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members
*   **Against**: Reject the reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members

- Approve the recurrent reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members
- Reject the reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members

16076,16076,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Wearables Creator Pass,"> by 0x2304d3f8c1d7e3692f8b8fcdcb9b8dc62b31131e (PanduhKing#131e)

so in the last few months there has been a huge influx in the amount of wearables been created, even more so with the added creator royalty we now receive.

I feel now there should be some way creators can maybe earn some sort of status or role, that enables them to create wearables. The current state of the market is a total free for all and these is a lot of low-quality items making its way into the game.

I feel to keep the market in a healthy state there needs to be a slower flow of items entering the game, giving previous items time to actually mint and sell rather than being pushed to the bottom of the featured and give every creator a chance to shine and get a name for themself.

maybe this could make upload fees cheaper with a pass? as more of a reward for being a recognised creator?

- Yes, we need to make a change to how uploads work
- No, the market is fine

16079,16079,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,[Resubmission] Should the legacy POI list be deleted?,"> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct#4d8d)

> \[This is a resubmission of [this original](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b3cb6dc0-9f01-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a) proposal that didn't meet the VP Threshold]

### Introduction

Points of Interest (or POIs) are a great way for users to explore and learn about cool places inside Decentraland. Right now the Decentraland project is maintaining two lists of POIs:

*   Decentraland Foundation-maintained list, the first implementation of POIs (Legacy POI List).
*   DAO-maintained list, updated by the DAO Committee after a governance proposal for adding or removing a POI is approved.

### Problem

This **creates an unnecessary complexity** by having to maintain two lists and prevents the DAO community from removing POIs that are defined on the legacy list by using the POI Removal proposal type.

On a more philosophical level, having a POI list embedded on the World Explorer (aka. Reference Client) **goes against the principle of decentralization and community ownership of the project** since another client wouldn't be able to use that list.

### Potential Solutions

There are a couple of solutions we could implement if we want to unify both lists:

*   We could simply migrate all POIs from the Legacy POI List to the DAO maintained one. However the legacy list has 90 POIs, and adding all those by an on-chain transaction will have an estimated gas fee of 200 USD each, **totaling a ~$18.000 USD expense to keep those POIs**

*   We could also delete the Legacy POI List and let the community re-add the POIs that are still relevant (Genesis Plaza for example!) to the DAO-maintained list. To minimize the risk of losing an important POI, before the deletion of the Legacy list we could have a discussion on Discord and the Forum about the relevant POIs that we absolutely need to migrate so we can start creating proposals right after the Legacy list has been deleted.

[Legacy POI List](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) -  See the [spreadsheet version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdjojNKYUOLt-5v2KHnE4-9IFR5zjsUhqckRNVdNX2o/edit#gid=1503583878) with POI names

This pre-proposal Poll aims to gather community feedback on the next steps. If any of the YES options get selected, this will become a DRAFT proposal for the community to vote on.

- Yes, delete the legacy list and let the community vote for the POIs that should be re-added to the DAO maintained list
- Yes, delete the legacy list and make the DAO pay for adding the 90 legacy POIs
- No, maintain both lists

Should the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

We must retain these new users!

The amount of questions I have answered in genesis plaza has been staggering. As such, I feel we need a person there to help! I have also witnessed appalling behavior over the last few days, I was able to assist folks in all reporting violent racist rhetoric. We do not need folks to spawn in for the first time and see that.

For this proposal, I believe one week's time would be the best for all parties. We can re-evaluate after that time period. I would assist folks for at least 4 hours a day, every day.

## Description

I am a certified digital marketer, monetized content creator, DCL landowner, and in my past life a tenured sales manager. I'm sure many of you have seen me around and hopefully noticed that I always do my best to be welcoming and assist new folks with any questions (NonFungibleDude). This would be a dream come true for me to have a chance to assist DCL in an official capacity while getting to know the community!

The idea that you show up and a real person is there to help you will set this experience even further apart from other gaming experiences folks will have had!

\#LastSliceGang


## Specification

At minimum 28 hours of my time over seven days being helpful and upbeat while making sure everyone has a good first impression of DCL.

I have already spent at least 4 hours in genesis plaza over the last three days helping folks out!


## Personnel

I will be the only person working on this project. I most likely at least casually know many of you so I can always introduce folks who may need professional assistance to folks who can assist them!

16096,16096,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Ethereum (L1) Wearables: A Comprehensive Proposal | Voting Power [Part 1],"> by 0xdab85506424396fb090d84b64ad63b770d87c028 (SuperMANA)

For those who have been here since inception, or rather close-to, have had the unique opportunity to watch Decentraland blossom into the iconic metaverse platform that it is today.

The nascent success that it’s experiencing today wasn’t a straight-forward path, and many community members here can attest to that. The early roll-out of NFTs in Decentraland has had a grey cloud over it for a long time.
My proposal today will hopefully clear that cloudiness and restore the once prosperous NFT community back to its former glory, which will include righting a few mishaps that Decentraland, and now the DAO, had made.

Before jumping into the proposal, it is imperative to highlight these points of contention.

\[Points of Contention]

1.  Decentraland, before the DAO, sold NFTs to the community, requesting MANA in return.

On the surface, this looks like a normal transaction; however, Decentraland’s exchange here was hostile as it never reward Voting Power for these NFTs, unlike LAND & NAMES, that were sold in exchange for MANA and hold Voting Power.

By doing this, Decentraland fully attacked the democratic abilities of the NFT Wearables community, suppressing them from holding Voting Power/NFT equivalent Voting Power to defend their community and promote their rights.

Furthermore, the DAO, highlighted this negligence by accepting Ethereum at a fixed $10 USD parity amount for the COVID Mask event. Here, they pegged the NFT price to USD and also did not accept MANA.
https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/decentraland-binance-against-covid19/

Those who were asked to purchased NFT wearables in MANA for the Halloween 2019 collection were hurt the most by this decision.

Majority of the collection was sold, not acquired via play-to-earn methods. The prices were as follows:

Mythic Items: 5,000 MANA
Legendary Items: 500 MANA
Epic Items: 100 MANA

The items and original address can be found here:
https://opensea.io/0x93a7c46443901c2ea2fc1263a4d076f470695d3a?tab=created\&search\[sortBy]=CREATED_DATE\&search\[resultModel]=ASSETS\&search\[sortAscending]=true

Upon the launch of this predominantly-purchase only collection, admins in Decentraland’s Discord “advertised” how to access OpenSea and buy these items set at the *market* price, which turned out to not be sticky.

2.  Developer/Admin/Foundation Member(s) of Decentraland sold their wearable NFTs to the community in exchange for MANA, often farming them before other community members could acquire them. There’s on-chain and YouTube history of this for the Xmas 2019 and Moonshot 2020 events.

To gain bipartisanship in this matter, I will withhold naming these particular members of the team for now and not share the recently curated Google Doc detailing the advertisement of wearables on OpenSea and Admins selling them to the community. Nonetheless, it is disappointing how certain individuals dumped on the community and rose to prominent positions within the DAO without any recourse or apologizing.

It is imperative to highlight this issue, as it showcases the poorly designed incentives that members of the team have to care about the L1 Wearable community, as many have sold a good portion of their NFTs, especially their earliest, most rare mints.

As an ombudsman for the wearables community, a resounding comment that has been made frequently is: “Paper hands are never rewarded, and the community expresses little sorrow in knowing that we had higher expectations of this project than those members of the project who dumped their NFTs on the community.”

\[PROPOSAL]

Now that we’ve cleared the air on the points of contention, let’s jump into the proposed solutions.

1.  Grant Wearables Voting Power

A flat amount of voting power per each L1 Wearable is the simplest solution, as the devs have mentioned; even though, Decentraland’s unique property design for wearables complicates this.

DAO Weighting for L1 Holders:

According to the data I pulled from GraphQL (this data should be validated by the community), the distribution is as follows for rarity type:

Unique             |	             4   |         0.005%
Mythic	     |          984   |       1.224%
Legendary     |   13,229   |    16.449%
Epic	             |   28,775   |    35.780%
Rare	             |   25,713   |    31.972%
Uncommon   |     6,309   |        7.845%
Common	     |     5,409   |         6.726%
Total	             |  80,423   |      100.00%

We sit on the shoulders of giants; those who came before us. Under this premise, I feel that pioneers of Decentraland should be rewarded for their time and bravery. For those just joining the community, there have been many moments along this journey where community members have shared losses.

Voting Power should be assigned in a two-tier ranking system, in an easy to assign manner for the Decentraland developers.

With this in mind, I propose a two-tier Voting Power weight.
Being the first collection, the Exclusive Mask collection, stands out in this regard. In addition, since the Halloween 2019 collection was a primary-purchase only collection, which hindered the democratic of many L1 holders, this collection should also be in that tier.

Being that the Xmas 2019 was a bugfest, I also propose including this collection into that same standalone tier. Lastly, to be included, should be the MCH (MyCryptoHeroes) collection, especially after some of the collection was incorrectly listed under the Mythic background color, which hurt many buyers.

All four of these collections were minted in 2019. Please note the 2019 weightings coincide with prices that Decentraland charged for the Halloween 2019 collection, save for rare(s) which were not sold but scales with proposed mint count.

2019 Collections                    | Voting Power
Mythic/Exclusive Masks    | 5000
Legendary/MCH                     | 500
Epic	                                           | 100
Rare	                                           | 10
Uncommon		                   | N/A
Common		                           | N/A

> 2019 Collections                 | Voting Power
> Unique/Mythic                        | 1000
> Legendary                                   | 100
> Epic	                                           | 10
> Rare	                                           | 2
> Uncommon		                   | 1
> Common		                           | 1

As with all proposals, please provide constructive feedback.

We need to push forward as a community and this has been quite the gray cloud. I believe there's a symbiotic relationship between adoption and a healthy, robust wearables market. We've listened to Discord admins incorrectly state that Decentraland slowed down because of gas fees. It's time for the community to rally and restore faith in Decentraland's wearables.

Let's promote and push for the revitalization of these historical pieces of art in Decentraland and the blockchain space, before the next 10,000 opts for Meta as their only platform.

Cheers,
SuperMANA

say you're in the virtual world of Decentraland and you run across someone that has their top 5 or 3 main interest listed next to their name and can be changed periodically.. something so simple as "" Someone to talk to "" promoting mental health, or ""First person shooter"" .. allows us to interact with someone easier.. "" what first person shooters you play?"".. ""you need someone to talk to? whats going on?"" ... if there is an event you're attending that day, show it off in your avatar and see if theres anyone else attending the same event. So many ways to interact in an easier way.. I truly believe this idea has major upside and potential.

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

My idea is to create a Futuristic Stadium in Decentraland for people to play 5vs5 against their friends. People will be able to book the stadium at different times, create teams, play, watch games on the available seats, beat on winning players and more. Teams will be able to play for free or bet a sum of MANA. The winning team will take the total sum of the beat and MANA will be divided equally and sent to the winning players. It will be fun and a great experience both for players and spectators.

I think it's safe to say we all like events. They bring a bit of pizazz to DCL and make the world feel that much more alive. But all too often, events are completely neglected by their hosts -- people stay up late and gather around spaces, only to find that nothing is actually happening on the land. There are also many events that occupy top real estate on the events page for *weeks*, but the event has actually concluded ages ago.

This is very frustrating and while DCL veterans may tolerate it to an extent, I feel this is extremely detrimental to the growth of the user base. I've brought new people into DCL before for events, and because the event doesn't happen (either it's delayed or completely forgotten about), the new players get frustrated and never touch DCL again.

I suspect some event hosts use the valuable real estate on the events page to market their products/services and don't actually intend on delivering the activities they promise. Who really knows - it's all conjecture. Nonetheless, I think users should have a way of upvoting or downvoting events so that hosts are held responsible for delivering quality experiences.

TL;DR: Implement upvoting/downvoting system for events.

## Description

As you might already know Descentraland is breaking the bubble and attracting the attention of people that are not familiar with the crypto world, the new joiners tend, and with reason to be sceptical and afraid of losing their money falling to scams, as an example today I asked a simple question on Decentraland official discord and got 4 scammers DM in less than 20 minutes.

This interactive digital training will teach the user by doing how to create their first wallet, set up and connect to Decentraland.

Development strategy:
The training will be created using manipulated screenshots, visual assets, animations and voice-over narration.
The user will hear and read the instruction and do it themselves click through a simulation of the Metamask user interface and Decentraland.

Following this development strategy, the training can be easily updated in case of updates and can also be translated to any available language without much effort.

The training will be divided into 4 modules:

1.  What is a Decentraland and Mana token?
2.  How to install and secure your wallet (Metamask)
3.  How to configure your wallet and connect to Decentraland
4.  Sending Ethererium or Mana to your wallet.


## Specification

Authoring tool:
Articulate storyline

Assets design:
Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator

Export Media:
SCORM (html+javascript)

Where to use:

*   It can be uploaded to any website
*   It can be hosted and accessed via the link
*   It can be hosted in an LMS and track progression, score etc.


## Personnel

The development will be led by me,  I am an Instructional Designer and former web developer/UX Designer. I have almost 10 years of experience working with e-learning globally.

My portfolio provides documentation of the most recent projects I have work from the
conception phase, storybook writing, design and development, starting with the most recent ones and moving backwards through time

https://www.linkedin.com/in/leosartori/


## Roadmap and milestones

Development Sprint 1:

*   Content gathering
*   Script and storybook writing
*   Screenshot capture
*   Assets creation (Illustrations, animations)

Approximately: 40 hours.

Development Sprint 2:

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

Enhance Builder smart items enough so they are capable of creating scene-size dynamic games like Pong or Breakout.  There are 254 smart items found in the Builder.  Some are +2 years old, most checked in and never touched again.  I will revisit all the smart items and add functionality where lacking.

Summary of work:

*   Add more dynamic functionality to a targeted subset of smart items: Trigger Type, Counter Type, Text Displaying Types, Toolbox
*   Improve user feedback by adding enabling/disabling clickable + customizable hover text feature
*   Make the smart item code more scene efficient by reducing re-creation of objects where not needed

## Description

Full Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/all-smart-items-prop.md

### Adding more dynamic functionality for the very specific subset of smart items

##### Trigger Types

Includes: Trigger Area, Trigger Round, Trigger Tile SciFi, Trigger Tile Square

I want to upgrade the code to the trigger system code found https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-ecs-utils.   This upgrade will extend the current user entered/exited triggers.  It will add the ability to detect when objects interact with other objects and also define what objects can interact with other objects.  Interact here means when the bounds of 2 trigger boxes intersect with each other.  An example: Food is triggered (or eaten) by both cats or mice. Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).

##### Counter Types

Includes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers

Scoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..

##### Text Displaying Types

Includes: Plain Text, Galleries

Be able to change the text, font, color by an action event

##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action

Toolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.

Bounce will have a few parameters like "" elasticity"" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.

### Make smart items more scene efficient.

##### Add more user feedback

The user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.

##### Some examples of better user feedback:

The Fantasy Black Button text says ""Press"" and cannot be changed to ""Press to open door"" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.

The Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says ""Interact"".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to ""Make smoothie"".  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.

The Trapdoor is not clickable nor has hover text.  While that is likely because it is supposed to be a secret trap door what if someone wants it to have this ability.  Make clickable with hover text ""Open secret door""


## Specification

### Demo / POC

You can see the work I started here

https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557

### General Audit

You can see here an audit of all smart items and the features proposed to be added.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VB-4osSEVUW0AobdsLCokq-j6wCve9Aytam5wYyZlag/edit?usp=sharing.

*   Name (Column B) gives the smart item name
*   Existing Actions/Parameters (Columns C thru D)
*   Audit of features existing or to be added (Columns G thru P)

This is a preliminary audit.  What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.

71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.

### Deliverables

The code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: ""smart-items"" since that is what they are and ""ce""  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/

I will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.


## Personnel

I already have one successful approved grant with delivered content. Below are the links to the previous grant, demo scene, and work delivered.  All of this proves I have the experience and skills required for working with smart items

*   Past Grant: https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ba798f30-d382-11eb-b705-3db38bad850a.

*   Deliverables:  https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce

I won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.

Scene here https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20

You can see my pull request to fix a bug found in the CyberPunk image cube item.
https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27


## Roadmap and milestones

### Time to Complete

I estimate roughly 10-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted, there are a lot of items to go through, 254 to be exact (and sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :).  Should the funding be approved I will start working and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.

### Status / Progress Communication

The status will be communicated twice a month through this grant forum.   See ""Discuss in the Forum"" link.   I also have my github repo which will track progress

*   Committed Code https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/
*   Project Work: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/projects/1
*   Status: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/wiki/Status:-Enhance-All-Builder-Smart-Items

### Milestones

*   Week 1-10 - Make smart items more scene efficient + Add more user feedback (Burn rate of ~25 a week)
*   Week 1-2 - Trigger Types + Toolbox Bounce Action
*   Week 2-3 - Counter types + Display Text types
*   Week 4-6 - Making a Game Demo Scene using Triggers and Counters.  A smattering of other updated items

Week deliverables tentative but give general delivery order\*

### Deliverables

The code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce

When browsing the collectible marketplace, you'll sometimes come across pages and pages of the same item (sometimes with no price difference). It makes it very difficult to find new items.

I propose a UX update that groups collectibles of the same item, so that you can see more variety and view the price range of specific items. Each item could have its own ""floor price"".

We really want to see Decentraland Grow! I believe We Are Gonna Make It! Decentraland has been growing a lot ! I am so happy to witness the growth! At the same time, there is a lot of work for Decentraland to do still to support our future.  If there was a referral incentive program i believe we could make a lot of progress by incentivizing others to promote, invite and recruit for Decentraland in which they will be rewarded in MANA for. Maybe a Networking Marketing Agency can be built and put in place with tiers (Rank from experience and seniority) and business model that goes in depth on how we can reward those who invite and recruit for Decentraland. Please start a discussion if this confuses anyone. I would like to Shout out Frank Morrison for thinking of this idea and sharing it with me. We had a great conversation and i thought i would share this idea with the community.

- Yes, Referral Incentives would be nice.
- No, this is unnecessary.

I believe it would be great to have a yearly Best of Decentraland awards ceremony. 15-30 categories ranging from:
Best new build (1x1, 1x2-4x4, and 4x5+)

Best new wearable

Best creator

Best streamer

User of the Year

Best reoccurring event

Best special event

Best music/party venue

Best educational venue

Best gaming venue

Best retail venue

Best non commercial property etc.

There would be a nomination period (ex. Jan 16-31), voting period (ex. Feb 1-15), and a ceremony (ex. Feb 20).

Prizes would be an official NFT certificate or wearable and bragging rights.

Voting would be 1 vote per user address.

A committee to choose a committee would have to be formed.

Official committee members would be excluded from being nominated (?).

The ceremony  would take place on DCL property.

A contest could be had to design the certificates.

I believe this would be a fun activity and bring attention to the best of what DCL has to offer, and motivate users to add to this wonderful community.

Details are all hypothetical. The poll is just asking ""Should there be an official Best of Decentraland Awards""

If this is already in the works or if you have ideas please discuss in the forum.

- yes
- no

## Abstract

To achieve this goal, we will make immersive advertising content for platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and beyond, to create an even better and more fulfilling experience for new players. Think about how it was for us all when we first started, someone welcoming found us and showed us the way.

Our project will include creator-made commercials, curated tours of Decentraland areas (especially some of the lesser-known ones); educational videos on cryptocurrency and how to protect yourself; and we will also include tutorials of the game, its systems and how to prosper/profit from playing and creating in Decentraland.

The main goal we have for this project, is to grow the popularity of the platform, and family within Decentraland.


## Grant size

2x 5-7minute Metaverse educational video to help newer users feel more comfortable in the Decentraland Atmosphere. Such as How to buy cryptocurrency, How to Protect your wallet, how to transfer cryptocurrency. Differences between wallet types ETC.

2x Decentraland touring video where we take the viewer through various exciting areas of the game, both new and old.

2x Decentraland tutorial video for those who are still not sure about all the amazing functions that Decentraland has to offer its community. (Such as custom Emotes, How to Parkour, how to travel to events/location and how to navigate the marketplace).

2x 10-15 minute video of targeted advertising specifically for Decentraland, outlining some of the already existing - and upcoming - land development projects throughout Decentraland.

60x 2 daily social media, and clip postings that will average in total 5 minutes of content from Decentraland, and its various features/events.

**Summary**

Define the price to upload Third Party Wearables and related commissions for the Curators Committee.

**Abstract**

Third Party Wearables is a new feature in which Third Parties -meaning other communities/companies/groups that already have their collections of NFTs in circulation- generate a 3D representation of their NFTs in Decentraland as wearables. More details and specifications in the original [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) for Third Party Wearables.

**Motivation**

Define a *fair* *slot* price (each Wearable needs one slot) for Third Parties to upload item representations of their NFTs and a *fair* *commission* *fee* for the Curators that will make sure these representations comply with Decentraland UI guidelines and aesthetics.

**Specification**

After the Third Party is added to the Third Party Registry as defined in the previous [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240), the Third Party Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and buy one *slot* for each NFT they want their community to have inside Decentraland.

Let use an example: [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/) (or any other NFT Collection) may want their NFT owners to have a cool stoner hat that is only available for them, a wearable that represents their community and culture. So representatives from CCC could request the DAO to add them as an accepted Third Party to the Third Party Registry. This is the first step, then the Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and start the process.

The CCC Managers can add 3D models that will represent the stoner hat wearable, but in order to do so, they need to buy one slot for each model. If they only want to give their NFT Owners one single hat for each of them, then they need to buy just one slot. If they want to create a collection of many different models, they need to buy one slot for each one.

**MANA collected from the slots purchases will got to DAO's Treasury and be used for:**

*   Curation fees for the Curators Committee
*   Cover storage costs for the 3D models

**There are a few things to consider before setting the slots price and commissions:**

*   Price will be paid in MANA, but it will be pegged to the US Dollar.
*   Collections that were designed in a procedural way (this means that each 3D representation is created by using an algorithm like Bored Apes, Cannabis Club, etc) are not going to be curated individually. For example: if the collection has 10k [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), and they were created in a procedural way, curators will only review a portion of the Collection and review the process used to create it. If it is compliant, the whole collection will be approved. Curators will receive commissions for the portion of the collection reviewed.
*   If the collection was not created in a procedural way, every item has to be curated individually.

This feature, Third Party Wearables, implies a new way to get closer to **interoperability**. Many strong communities with valuable NFTs would be able to let their members enjoy them inside Decentraland.

**Voting options**

1.  Slot Price: USD 300 / Commission for Curators: USD 50
2.  Slot Price: USD 400 / Commission for Curators: USD 50
3.  Slot Price: USD 500 / Commission for Curators: USD 50
    *(similar to [new fee structure](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) for regular wearables)*
4.  Slot Price: USD 600 / Commission for Curators: USD 50
5.  Slot Price: USD 700 / Commission for Curators: USD 50

**Examples**

*   **Option 1 wins**
    BAYC collection has 10k NFTs and they want to upload 20 cool BAYC sneakers, they will need to buy 20 slots.
    *   Total cost: USD 6,000
    *   Curators will receive USD 1,000
*   **Option 3 wins**
    BAYC collection has 10k NFTs and they want to upload 20 cool BAYC sneakers, they will need to buy 20 slots.
    *   Total cost: USD 10,000
    *   Curators will receive USD 1,000
*   **Option 3 wins - Procedural Collection**
    BAYC collection has 10k NFTs and they want to upload 1,000 cool BAYC sneakers that were created in a procedural way, they will need to buy 1,000 slots.
    *   Total cost: USD 500,000
    *   Curators will receive USD 2,500 assuming a portion of 50 out of 1,000 wearables were curated and the procedural process is validated by the curator
*   **Option 5 wins**
    Cryptomotors collection has 15 NFTs and they want to upload 15 wearables, they will need to buy 15 slots.
    *   Total cost: USD 10,500
    *   Curators will receive USD 750

Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

the project will take place in the 4 corners of the map, creating the 4 favorite travel themes of people around the world including the associated leisure activities and the universes that allow you to escape through the screen:
Mountains: Skiing, snowboarding, sledding, snowball fights...
Beach, Seas: jetski, boats, swimming, fishing...
Desert: Rally, buggy, treasure hunt...
Forest: Hunting, hiking, climbing, tree climbing, paintball...
The goal of this project is to travel ""To the 4 corners of the world"" in decentraland, the idea is to teleport to the user's dream destination in one click and allow the world to practice the preferred activity of their choice, or simply gaze at the mountains or the deep end of the ocean.


## Grant size

240,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xC5cf3073bb48064004fb9456c8745D970937D492

## Description

let's get to the heart of the matter, the project will be the largest and most diverse (by different places) ever to offer a decentralized game. the funding will be used to create the grounds as well as the content, activities and nfts. All the problems will be solved thanks to its places of escape, because wouldn't that be the key word of the decentraland project? ESCAPE. tastes and colors are not discussed, perfect, we have all the tastes! Each user will have the choice to travel through 4 themes which include absolutely all the destinations where they wish to find themselves in real life. therefore no one will be left out.
Advantages :

*   Attract as many people as possible by diversifying places
*   allow users to spend as much time as possible on the game in order to perform all the activities on each place
*   create competitions and prizes to generate attractiveness
*   Buy nft for each hobby
    There will be countless numbers of nft that the user can buy with Mana, for leisure performance or simply the aesthetics of outfit items: NFT available for purchase;
*   Mountains: Skiing, snowboarding, clothing, chalets....
*   Beaches, seas/ocean: beach accessories, jet-skis, boats, fishing accessories...
*   Desert: Buggy, animals, quad, motorcycle..
*   Forest: Hunting accessories, paintball accessories, hiking clothes...
    This will be NFT's biggest buying pool.
    This would allow decentraland to stand out completely from the rest of the games.


## Specification

The first step will be to design the first theme to open it as quickly as possible, thus allowing players to get there and start escaping through the game, the design will be done place by place to be able to open going fatest and keep the desire to discover the places and activities to come. the next steps will be decided once we have contacted me to develop the summary of work. it takes several brains to put together this kind of project.


## Personnel

I don't want to hide anything from you, I'm just a simple user of the game who wonders what to do inside after a short time spent on it..
The help of all the community who wants will be needed blend into the project.


## Roadmap and milestones

the progress will be seen as the community will have access to binoculars overlooking the work sites (mountain creations, forests, beaches...) and a report displayed on a panel in front allowing to see the work. progress of work and activities create in writing day by day.
If we join forces the project can see the light of day quickly in order to attract future users who do not yet dare to enter the METAVERSE.

## Description

My project will bring a whole lot of celebrities and Music Stars from the African continent into the Metaverse!

I intend to use my EP to educate and enlighten African creators about the importance of the 4th industrial revolution which includes blockchain technology, machine learning, VR, AI.

This project will educate them on how Decentraland can propel their content into the global stage through releasing their music and movie content as an NFT in the metaverse.

On the other hand Decentraland will be tapping into a continent of over 1.4 billion people with Huge potential and need for the Blockchain. Africa has the most to benefit from Blockchain and bringing Decentraland into the continent to content creators, movie and music producers, musicians, actors and actresses who already have a large fanbase on social media will be a win win situation Decentraland.

I will be the first African Musician in the Afrobeat music space to release my music  content as an NFT in  the Metaverse through Decentraland


## Specification

I intend to release each of my singles as NFT in the Metaverse through Decentraland in partnership with various media power house to bring awareness of the metaverse to my colleagues in the Mainstream Afrobeat music space.

A second step is to introduce digital performance in the metaverse which is a strategy to introduce Decentraland to African musicians and content creators in the movie space, fashion, entertainment, showbiz etc.

This project is a continent wide project hence the request for the budget


## Personnel

I have a team of seasoned entrepreneurs and content creators which includes videographers, cinematographers, dancers, musicians, actors and actresses to team up with to propagate and popularise Decentraland to their huge multimillion fanbase.

This project will  bring measurables goals that can propel the growth of Decentraland in the African market .

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

I am going to be hiring a ""Life Coach"" that specializes in assisting people to prepare and finalize their TEDx. He has a helped 300+ people reach their goal of sharing their message with the world, for some ultimately landing paid speaking and book deals. Real quick overview of the message I'm going to be sharing. Misdiagnosed and mismedicated at 12, a first suicide attempt at 14, high school and collegiate athlete. Diagnosed Bipolar at 19. Broke my back snowboarding at 22, in come the opiates and back surgeries. Multiple suicide attempts (life support for 7-10 days), rehabs, and psych wards. Thought bipolar diagnosis was a death sentence, no Dr. told me anything different. Finally overcame. No more meds and life worth living.


## Grant size

4,998 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x479D5C2BEb27206fe1a369F26C25469C389fC54E

## Description

I have been on the crypto/blockchain journey for a little over 3 years (seriously for 2) and I can't believe how many people are still so reticent to take the plunge. My intent is once I have a platform with which to ""inspire and influence"" people (not to be arrogant) I hope to help brick and mortars make the transition to blockchain and online literacy.  I have an old-school mentality with a forward/future-looking mindset. I refuse to play by anyone else rules for the sake of decorum. I refuse to live according to any labels, titles, and roles that I disagree with either morally or philosophically. I am whole, healthy, and a force to be reckoned with, I will not go quietly into that good night. I will help tear down this infernal machine brick by brick, bringing it all down on my head if I must. I will not let this garbage be passed on to my children. Help me.


## Specification

Pay the ""tuition"" for the Life Coach and his team. I have already had a final interview, just waiting to raise the funding to begin the one on one work and start filling out the TEDx applications.


## Personnel

Taylor Conroy has developed ""How To Land A TEDx Talk & Spread Your Message To Millions In The Next 30 Days."" training. The ""tuition covers that 30 days and then he continues to mentor one on one for 12 months after. He has put together a team of trainers. Travis Connover is my contact that I have interviewed with and will be working closely with.


## Roadmap and milestones

Taylor's team fills out the first 20 applications to land a TEDx talk within 30 days. I will document and update via a blog/vlog/social media channels but will write personalized letters to the community and any donors that help me reach this goal. In addition to the micro-updates, I will send a ""highlights"" update discussing the progress on macro-level every 30 days and will provide access to my trainers and mentors to send updates and communicate, and answer any questions from any of those responsible for helping me reach my goals. Be they good things or bad things about my progress.

With all thats going on in the world, I thought it might be an interesting idea to have an area where people can go to discuss issues and talk about ideas that would get us closer to peace.

With sovereign states setting up in DCL, I think it might be an interesting concept worth a conversation. Who would have thought 10 years ago that twitter would have been a hot bed of political communications? DCL could be a great medium, and I think we should capitalize on it.

I know the idea is pretty vauge, but there could be scheduled speakers on given topics. With censorship on the rise around the world, this could be a fantastic platform to have truly open and diverse conversations!

Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

We are asking for funding to acquire a 1x1 parcel in Decentraland to house our NFT projects lounge and host regular, weekly community events. We will integrate our community into Decentraland through this lounge.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xd41308f50858Da2b7cc641e493fbddf34775393A

## Description

Upon approval of the grant, we would be able to purchase a plot of land (1x1) to host community events and further integrate our community with the Decentraland metaverse. We have feature where users would be able to mint our NFTs from the scene in Decentraland, as well as link our wearables that are already approved. We have a parkour course that will be constantly updated and maintained for users to earn POAPs or wearables in the future. We want to connect with already established brands and grow the community through a positive environment.


## Specification

The scene has already been built using the Decentraland builder and SDK. We use a program like Visual Code Studio to write the SDK and manage/maintain the script for the events. If the grant is approved, we will acquire the land via a purchase on OpenSea and begin deploying the scene. We have a banner for the Events page as well as a street team to work on promoting events and the scene. All we really need to get this going is the funding for the land.


## Personnel

Ryan Guthrie - Co Creator of Smvsh Friends NFT and leading Decentraland Scene builder. Built the lounge as well as other 3D assets used to import onto the scene. Our metaverse architect.

Joseph Ortega - Lead Developer of Smvsh Friends and Co Creator. Back-end AND front-end dev and support for the technical side of things such as the SDK.

Specimen XIII - Parkour course creator and enthusiast. Prior experience building in Decentraland for Bored Vibes. Part of the street team to promote events and bring community together.


## Roadmap and milestones

Our project has already launched and we have already started growing our community substantially. We have quite a few members that are very into the metaverse side of web3 and spend quite some time in Decentraland as well as other virtual worlds like VRChat and The Sandbox.

Our goal is to acquire at least a 1x1 plot of land where we can house our Smvsh Friends lounge, showcase our NFTs, and host events for the community to enjoy and get to know some awesome positive and influential people in our network.

The lounge is already built, all we are waiting on is funding for the land. Originally we planned on buying land at 50% mint-out with our project, but with the way things are progressing, we wanted to acquire land as fast as possible.

## Abstract

A few months ago, I had many questions about DCL, as did many redditors, so I created and added an entire page to my website (https://letsdodefi.com/decentraland-guide) dedicated to onboarding newcomers, and further educating existing players about Decentraland and its history + capabilities. I have been moderating it since.

I noticed a one-stop-shop knowledge base was missing, so I took the initiative to learn and create this website to educate myself and everyone else who shared the same questions. Ranging from the explanation of claiming your username, to the world map, to districts, wearables, and even fun things to do in DCL!

After getting a vote of confidence from DCL admin, ""Toonpunk"", (who loved the website), here I am! :)

## Description

Since April, my Decentraland, all-in-one free guide (https://letsdodefi.com/decentraland-guide) has received thousands of views, and has received awesome feedback with requests for me to update it.

I have been fairly busy and haven't updated it in a month or so, and so I figured a financial grant could align me to maintain and moderate this awesome knowledge base.


## Specification

I have completed the core of this project already:
(https://letsdodefi.com/decentraland-guide) , but I plan to add some CSS to polish it up, and then continue to moderate it indefinitely :)

I use Notion hosted on Super, which I pay for myself. And I do the CSS polishing myself during my spare time.

I think updating this resource is crucial to onboarding the masses into our metaverse.


## Personnel

I am a one-man-army here. I am and will be working on this all alone, as I enjoy doing it and learning more about DCL.

I am a DeFi content creator who documents and educates others who are intimidated by the space. I aim to make guides and content that anyone can understand, which casts a wide net to help onboard non-techy people even.

My YouTube:  https://youtube.com/c/DefiDonut
My DeFi education site: https://letsdodefi.com/
My Twitter: https://twitter.com/thekriskay/


## Roadmap and milestones

Since the website is already up and running, I will be responsible for:

*   Updating it with new content as DCL evolves
*   Add a ""DAO votes"" section that explains new votes that passed.
*   Polish it a tiny bit with some CSS

I am in the DCL discord and in communication with a few admins.
I have no problem reporting updates there.

Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

I built a very simple and easy-to-use Parkour Park on location 35, -79. Players jump on top of objects to complete the parkour course.

I was very happy this morning seeing a user using my Parkour Park:
https://imgur.com/a/dJu67Hc

I would like to reward players that climb the parkour with a wearable tracksuit so they are incentivized to explore the map.

The wearable Tracksuit will be a 2 Piece Unisex Set of Pant and Jacket of a Color that will be determined in the future.

This grant is only to cover the publication fee for these wearable Tracksuits.

My Goal for this project is to incentivize players to Explore More By Giving them Wearables after Finishing the Parkour Challenge.

I'm a Software Developer, More about me in the description

## Description

Parkour Park:
https://imgur.com/a/bTPZsKg

I built a Parkour Park on land that I'm operating. Someone was kind enough to let me build on his land.

I would like to reward users of my Parkour Park with Wearable tracksuits so everyone goes to the Park to Grab his Tracksuit Set.

Here is a picture of someone using my Parkour Park:

My goal is to incentivize players to explore newly built parcels by rewarding them with wearables.


## Specification

My Parkour Park:
https://imgur.com/a/bTPZsKg

In order to complete my project, I will create a wearable Tracksuit that will be claimable after climbing the parkour.

I'm very confident in my abilities to perform this job because of my preliminary work.

The main obstacle for this project was finding the land to operate because parcels are very costly but right now I'm operating 12 plots which are enough for this job but the parkour is expected to be 1x1 to not take much space.

The tasks left to complete for this project are:

1.  Creating 3D Models of Tracksuits

2.  Submit outfits for review

3.  Integrate Outfit to Parkour Park

I'm very confident that my background as a software developer will help me complete this work. I have experience developing in c# as a full-stack developer. In my free time, I do 3d Modeling and Unity


## Personnel

This is planned to be a solo operation but the Land was provided by the user Gucci.

My portfolio of VR and Desktop Games:
https://javierromancruz1.itch.io/

As you can see in the games I'm used to working with 3D Models and New Technologies.


## Roadmap and milestones

I believe having group chats would be nice, you will be able to be connected and let them know where you are & communicate in world to your friends at the same time. Hopefully the friends list can be fixed soon so we can have more ideas to support consistently.

TheGoldGuy and I hosted a Private Event at the Frosty Friends Club & he mentioned a few great ideas that he was okay with me proposing.. We propose the concept that those who own land and develop the land should be incentivized to, as they are bringing value to the community. The person who owns land shouldn't lose their Voting Power and i believe they deserve it for being so early and having such conviction. The world is increasing and new users are valuing the land more and more. We are also realizing the leverage being a land owner brings. I believe rewarding those who are working on their land and giving back to the community will only increase productivity and maybe call back the ones who are only holding land.

## NFT Collections Description

Our first CFO collection was created to embody proud and powerful women serving our mission. We diversified our CFOs of all races, including skin conditions. CFO #4 was particularly special for bringing awareness to vitiligo. CFOs promote inclusivity of all women, which was embodied in our second collection when we created handicapped women as CFOs. Our second collection tied the whole essence of all the past and future collections.  No matter where a holder is in the world, including handicapped individuals that may be limited, you can make an impact. CFOs are meant to make an impact.

## Motivation

CFO AKA Creative Freedom Officers are meant to be a symbol of positivity and change in Web3. CFOs promote and protect freedom involving creativity, opinion, and self-expression. CFO's first priority is to protect against subjective censorship. Having a 'CFO' on the shoulder of an avatar would symbolize that the avatar and individual support expression in an objective manner, with open arms and without judgment. Representation of a CFO in Decentraland would also compliment the DAO for its true democratic values. CFO's believe in objective standpoints as opposed to subjective opinions with agendas. We believe that all individuals should act and express themselves freely in correlation to the laws of human nature.

## Abstract

Flowershop is an Ultramono LABS embassy, for hosting our gallery, concert, and performance events. Ultramono organises events dedicated to progressive, futuristic, fusion art and  electronic  dance music, digital permaculture, inspiring conversations, and presents a gallery and clubbing events.

## Beneficiary address

0xa0d258e7895096f813dacdaa4cdc5bf4fddd4847

## Description

Flowershop is a cross between a gallery, club and a concept store. The idea of the flower shop that is so much more than the ordinary flower store comes from the cult Italian comic book Alan Ford by Bax Munker and Magnus. Flowershop is run by Ultramono, an art laboratory for the production of cybernetic art. Founded by Tanja Vujinovic (www.tanjav.art), new media artist with more than 25 years of experience in production and execution of multimedia events, Flowershop is going to be a new location and  continuation of Ultramono events organized across the Metaverse, that were recently held among other platforms also on VRChat and Sansar. It is envisioned as an online venue for live cyber exhibitions, performances and other events to showcase the work of artists and scientists before an international audience that will innovatively involve blockchain platform to support both community at large and participants. Using poaps, tickets, wearables, works of art, and creating workplaces, Flowershop will expand the ecosystem of the emerging new economy in art production within Decentraland.


## Specification

Project will be executed in stages, first being the actual building of the venue. Models of the building already exist, so this is going to be a process of optimization and adjusting the initial sketch so it can be fully functional on Decentraland platform. After the initial stage of building and setting up the base, we will start with developing individual modules and governance of the Flowershop, and work on a multiyear programme of exhibition, party, and conversations programme, and define curated and conceptualized exhibitions. We plan to have up to ten curated collective and individual exhibition per year, and monthly talks and party events, with spontaneous events as well. We are going to use this grant to hire stuff for curation and organization, get help in building and optimization, promote and network not just on the Internet but also using real life media outlets like for example Flash Art, and try to get in touch with art bloggers. Most important aspect of the whole Part of the grant will be used to get the land for the venue. Flowershop concept is the idea of self sustainability, so extra special attention will be devoted to having help with facilitating the financial management of the space so both the programme will continue and all involved could receive compensation for their contribution to the programme.


## Personnel

Ultramono is founded by a new media artist Tanja Vujinovic (https://www.tanjav.art/) who has produced and participated in hundreds of IRL and online events in the field of arts and culture. As a highly experienced world builder, an artist , PhD holder in the field of Media arts and philosophy but also curator and event manager, she has presented her works on numerous festivals, in galleries and museum across the world, and recently Metaverse.  The whole team and the structure of the Ultramono LABS is visible on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/dqVXsRr
Besides already existing team members, we plan to hire few more people who are ""natives"" in Decentraland, mostly for consultations and to initially help facilitate community aspect of the space and establish good monetary practices for all involved and our future audience.
Flowershop is the latest iteration that spawn from our success in organizing events in VRChat and Sansar, with the idea of making our permanent base in Decentraland and securing our financial sustainability across the Metaverse by making Decentraland our permanent and central home base.


## Roadmap and milestones

Progress will be reported on a weekly bases in writing and on our Flowershop community meetup every Saturday at 21:00 CET at our location, in front of everyone interested to hear about the development. Execution of all tasks described in the project proposal will start immediately as our initial funding is secured. Project is expected to be fully executed within three months, with our first public event expected to happen in January 2021. In the meantime, we are starting our with promotion campaign of the whole Flowershop as a cross between a gallery, a club and a concept store on all social media and within our already existing networks, so we could get as much support as possible.

## Abstract

Decentrafun is requesting a grant to reimburse and sustain a portion of our costs in community building and education. We have been documenting and sharing our creative process through making tutorials and videos for over a year. The progress and speed of our community development from a one parcel gallery to a three-land complex art and education estate have delightfully surprised all of us involved! See the first video here https://youtu.be/e5FCb4hYqPg and the most recent here https://youtu.be/7ev7q4qzMp8

Our community includes multi-talented people from around the world who are all about having FUN while contributing their expertise toward developing the exciting possibilities in Decentraland.

## Description

Onboarding to DCL can be a daunting process to many people. Assistance through community is needed because learning and support are required to fully engage in all the delightful, beneficial activities the virtual world provides. Our group is building trust and awareness about Decentraland through social media channels, event promotions, and education. It is our experience that documenting our creative process and making video tutorials is helping to make onboarding easier and build community in DCL.

In addition to tutorials, we are networking. We have successfully used applications, giveaways and events to reach new artists, collectors, and crypto users who have entered and utilized the benefits of Decentraland.

We have submissions from 18 countries in our gallery. They are, in order of number of entries: United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom, India, Denmark, Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon, Japan, Romania, Philippines, Malaysia, Nepal, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Italy.
We host recurring weekly events in Decentraland, such as Mermaid Tarot Readings and Heros and Dragons game.
We have a global music event coming in October ‘21 featuring DJ’s from around the world, NFT and POAP giveaways, and participatory modules.
We have events planned with our cryptocurrency partners such as Polygon, Shiba Inu, and BAO.

We plan to continue our community-building education and entertainment efforts and have reached a point where we must scale our project in order to meet the level of interest. We must improve accessibility in order to create seamless delivery across social channels and within our complex in Decentraland. It is important that all who wish to access these offerings can do so easily and have fun while they do!

While we're excited about the pilot results, it is also clear that to offer the content we envision will require a team committed to consistent effort, and more resources. Our goal is to keep growing the Decentraland community through ease of accessibility, education, and fun events. Having a portion of our community building costs reimbursed from the new DAO grant program would enable us to scale our project.


## Specification

We have created a flowchart to help onboard people, one step at a time, starting with introducing them to Decentraland first. You can see the flowchart here: https://foreverbird.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/screen_shot\_2021-05-19\_at\_2.31.35\_pm.png

We are using an app to help get feedback on what is of interest to the greater social media community. You can view the results of our Genesis competition here: https://gleam.io/PAYZc/decentrafun-crypot-art-giveaway

16147,16147,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Wearables Request &mdash; Add Duplicate Item Stacking to Marketplace,"> by 0xe58d9940a395d303e691dbe0676710d9c140101a (Archonomous)

Hello, Residents of Decentraland ~

This poll requests for duplicate items to be stacked into one listing on the marketplace. Similar to on OpenSea, this change would make it so when you click on an item, it takes you to a marketplace page specifically for that item which would then list all current sale prices by amount/user. With a system like this, it may even allow for users to post 'buy' offers as a potential future feature.

The reason for suggesting such an improvement is to keep the marketplace uncluttered, especially with the recent unveiling of L2 wearables. I believe we all know what it's like to sort through 10 pages of rainbow earrings and grey hats, and I only see this issue getting more out of hand as wearables continue to release, especially in high quantity collections.

Ease of technological implementation aside, this poll constitutes a community '
'temperature check' to get the issue out into the world and start discussing quality of life improvements such as these. Thank you for considering this request.

- Yes, allow duplicate item stacking for wearables.
- No, keep the marketplace as-is.

Decentraland's largest district which is Aetheria allows for contributors to own their LAND via DEED. Unfortunately, the issue is that DEED is unrecognizable in the marketplace. The only place to currently trade DEED is on Opensea. Having Deed trade-able on the marketplace gives contributors the option to trade/sell/lease (when leasing becomes available) along with potential new users looking to build inside of the district that is currently half empty.

## Description

To circumvent the very high gas fees associated with full on-chain governance, Decentraland’s DAO uses a combination of free, off-chain voting for the community and a multi-sig wallet controlled by a “DAO Committee”

create a system that allows users to safely loan mana to wearable creators in return for a cut of the profit afterwards. e.g. you loan 500 mana for a creator to mint an item and they in return give you 700 mana and a free wearable. Eligibility could be based on how many votes a creator gets in a discord channel for their wearable before it is released. Or there could be some sort of verification process that gives the creator a discord role and then if they fail to pay the loan back after they have sold enough to do so, the role will be revoked

I believe this would increase the number of wearable creators and therefore diversity of wearables and would mean grants wouldn't have to be given by the DAO as much.

Chibis P2E Game whereby anyone in decentraland can participate in a scavenger style hunt across our futuristic-dystopian-punk-cyber-jungle and city landscape.


## Grant size

80,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

## Description

We believe that we are bringing new metaverse users to decentraland.  We have 60,000 people in our discord and ~3,000+ unique holders across ~6,700 unique NFTs.   Our user base is not the ""old school"" decentraland or ""OG"" NFT collectors.  The majority of our userbase is new to the NFT and Metaverse space.

As a project we have invested heavily in decentraland as we see dcl as such a meaning place for building our community and expanding our overall reach to the web3 community.
We are hosting a New Years Day party with 15+ Projects, a grammy nominated artist (Aloe Blacc), SpottieWifi, and hope to bring as many users online as possible in dcl.

While we love 'partying' in the metaverse, we want to show our community and the world what the next level looks like for Chibi Labs and the Chibi Nation in the metaverse.   We also want to create ""Sticky-ness"" and a symbiotic relationship between Decentraland, our NFT holders, and the entire DCL and Web3 community.

Our team and our community has been researching Play-to-Earn and we see a very valid use case for Chibi Labs and the Chibi Nation to build out a Play to Earn game in DCL.

We know that Play-to-Earn is the next way for us to show our community about the next chapter of the metaverse.  Aside from Wondermine and the casinos, play-to-earn seems super early in Decentraland.  We understand the importance We have been impressed with the ""Sticky-ness"" of Wondermine and hope that we can show DCL, our community and the world that our Play to Earn strategy will be fun, and keep users coming back.

We also seek your guidance and strategy as to what can and can't be done with Play-to-Earn in DCL.  We pride ourselves on investigating every edge of the Metaverse landscape.  At Chibi Labs, we  consider this just the beginning of our Journey in Decentraland.

As a project and as a community, we will always do whatever we can to increase awareness about the metaverse, decentraland, and web3 safety.


## Specification

Chibis P2E Game (Decentraland) (abbrev...)
1.Players will traverse the Chibi dystopian punk jungle to acquire 5-10 colorful GEMS in a Scavenger hunt type of format.
2\. To fit our lore, the ""gems"" would be ""Comprised of Silica"" will be placed in our ""conveyer belt"" room  in our Chibi Town to be converted into “microchips”
3\. Using ""Microchips"", players can redeem ""Chibi Coins"" (for DCL only)
4\. Daily Multiplier rewards to encourage daily engagement and ""Sticky-ness"".

Players will race each other to complete a timed event that will be a checkpoint race course through the map that can be redesigned to make for different races. ---Simply using a highlighted ball of light or something to indicate where to go will be enough.

POAP’s will be given to the high score of the day, and or one given to the highest score of the week/month. (1 of 1 POAP)(date/time/players name/etc)

Leaderboards need to be auto updated with usernames and times of completion

POAPs could be given to player with flawless victory (all 7 days in a week)

POAPs potential redemption process could include a chance to win a chibination
decentraland item or even an actual chibi

Leaderboards need to be auto updated with usernames and times of completion

Advertising Space on the walls of the Conveyer belt room and other office spaces needs to be easily changed for promotions and opportunities for sponsored ads

We'd like to add PLAY-TO-EARN to Chibination.dcl.eth.link ASAP.  As soon as we receive funding we would be contracting with a team to build this.

We would implement this PLAY-TO-EARN Game as a phase 1 program.  Implementation could be within 3-4 months.

Once phase 1 is complete. We can survey our community as well as the decentraland community and DAO for suggestions of improvements for phase 2 of our PLAY TO EARN game in Decentraland.

We feel that we are all still super early in this space and welcome the community to supply input, suggestions, and feedback of what they want to see happen next in Phase 2 of our PLAY TO EARN GAME.

In the short to medium term we feel it is super important to get started with the PLAY TO EARN GAME in Decentraland.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Cheers,
The Team at Chibi Labs

There is a demand in the community for trading wearables with integrity. I like JTV's idea of using a site and having his HQ compatible for trading. Can we decentralize this to be able to trade with any one any where in DCL? Such as a trading kiosk the size of a POAP machine that both parties connect to and then they will be brought to a trade site to trade honestly.

Scrolling the page of wearables sorted by cheapest price shows a ton of repeated wearables of 1 mana price, which makes the search useless and with ton of pages.

I think it would be better to group them all by lowest price. That is, if there are 5000 entities of 1 model, show only 1 time in the shop with the lowest price.

Also, it would prevent people to buy at higher price as the default sorting is ""recently listed"".

Also with a quick look, the buyers can directly see the floor price.

## Specification

Non conosco ancora le specifiche precise


## Personnel

About seven thousand remain standing (according to some sources eight thousand) \[2], scattered throughout the island, on average one every 3 km², strongly distinguishing the Sardinian landscape. It is assumed that in the past their number was much greater. In fact there are numerous attested examples, and even more those hypothesized on the basis of the finds found in various centers, of civil buildings (for example, nuraghe Gianbasile in Sindia), noble (Palazzo Zapata in Barumini) and even more frequently religious (nuraghe Lo 'under the church of Sant'Eligio in Bosa, Santa Maria Maddalena in Guamaggiore, San Nicola in Orroli, Santa Vittoria in Nuraxinieddu (Oristano), San Simone in Escolca, etc., just to name a few), built not only by stripping the structure but very often directly on the foundations of pre-existing nuraghi. As for their function, scholars have not yet expressed a common opinion, while most of them think that they were built in the second millennium BC, starting from 1800 BC. up to 1100 BC \[3]


## Roadmap and milestones

Some are more complex and articulated, real nuragic castles with the highest tower which in some cases reached a height between twenty-five and thirty meters. In most cases, however, these are towers narrowed upwards, once 10 to 20 meters high, with a base diameter of 8 to 10 meters.

In some areas they are located a few hundred meters from each other, as in the Valle dei Nuraghi of the historical region of Logudoro-Meilogu, or in the regions of Trexenta and Marmilla.

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

The aim is to build a fully functional integration between the [MetaMundo](https://metamundo.co/) marketplace and Decentraland to enable new and existing 3D creators to drive user adoption and engagement in Decentraland by populating it more efficiently with 3D assets. This will benefit 3D creators, landowners and Decentraland users altogether.


## Grant size

115,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

## Description

There is a huge opportunity to improve monthly active users with an active inflow of high quality scenes. Making sure there is more to do and to see, is possible by helping 3D creators get their scenes into Decentraland with less friction, enabling more building. If Decentraland is able to attract more new users by more easily deploying new experiences, it will strengthen it’s position as one of the leading platforms in the metaverse.

MetaMundo recently launched as a dedicated 3D NFT marketplace for metaverse scenes and assets. Our aim is to onboard our existing network of 16,000 plus high quality and experienced 3D modelers, architects and designers to help build experiences, scenes and assets for the metaverse. This network comes from the team and their previous companies. MetaMundo's vision is to remove the major inefficiencies for creating metaverse scenes and assets and ​​make it very easy for creators to publish engaging content ready to use in Decentraland through their 3D model conversion and optimisation pipelines delivered to the DCL end user with just a few clicks.

Our intention is to build a seamless integration between the MetaMundo marketplace and the Decentraland SDK so that 3D scene and asset collectors can be easily deployed to their land without friction. The integration will bring a high quality 3D NFT marketplace on board as a partner organization to easily supply scenes to Decentraland and drive traffic, engagement and retention. Our mission with this is to help to populate Decentraland with engaging content at a much faster rate and enable artists to list and sell their creations on a much larger scale. The MetaMundo platform integration will also function as an active onramp for new 3D artists into Decentraland.

## Specification

To develop a seamless deployment solution, it’s important to describe and breakdown how MetaMundo supports 3D creators to optimize and mint their models into 3D NFTs optimized for Decentraland. The first two parts of the process are focused on model processing and configuration. With the artwork and the interactions configured, the final part of the process is to integrate assets into Decentraland via the Builder. We’re planning to deliver a seamless experience by passing all the configurations and artwork defined prior to import directly into a user’s Scene, ready to deploy to their LAND.

We will start with integrating the MetaMundo marketplace with DCL via API to work directly with the Builder and DCL SDK. This will enable us to automate all the steps that are currently required from the user, like importing and configuration, and turn this into a single, more streamlined flow directly from the MetaMundo marketplace.

Our servers we will store a safe backup of all the files acquired by the user. These servers will help us configure the files in the cloud enabling easier deployment of the data defined from the MetaMundo platform. Data will be sent between the server, the client and marketplace using traditional data requisition and JSON data transfer for complex data, and sensitive content will be secured under wallet validation using Web3 standards.

We plan to develop a library of interactions and ready-to-use features and plug-ins, built entirely in Typescript/Javascript to make it easier to interact with the DCL SDK. This way we can abstract part of the development work, and this layer will ensure we automate manual processes like positioning and configuring sub systems from the NFT. We’ll create a complete building system using cloud infrastructure with CI to ensure we can automatically test, run and iterate with assets under development.

Our goal is to automate the model processing pipeline. It will go from high-fidelity 3D file to a DCL optimized version, we will create plugins for leading 3D software (Python scripts will be adapted for each software) that will have a faster iteration process, along with a complete CI system helping artists to validate their 3D work in the Decentraland environment without any friction (enabling a preview build easily from Blender and 3ds Max).

Here are a few examples of interactive scenes by popular artists like Dutchtide, LuisFern5 and Mila Lolli that MetaMundo has helped optimize for use in Decentraland:

## Roadmap and milestones

**TS/JS Decentraland Abstraction Library (1 Month)** The library will have a lot of abstractions and automations to make it faster and easier to include interactions, features and to integrate with the DCL SDK.

**DCL Builder Integrations (3/4 Weeks)** This tool will be a smart bridge to connect our client and server sides with the Builder to automate importing and configuring steps. This will require a robust API to be able to directly integrate with Decentraland internal systems.

**DCL Emulation System (1 Month)** This step will emulate Decentraland using the native SDK and validate requirements to make sure it will be running in the best way possible. It will also make it possible to iterate faster by enabling everything to be tested without the need of manual export and import in the builder.

**3D File Conversion Pipeline (3/4 weeks)** Development of an 3D file conversion pipeline that will take master .FBX, .USD, or .OBJ files from creators and convert these files and optimize it into a DCL friendly .GLB file format ready to use immediately within DCL. This conversion pipeline will consider limitations such as size, poly count, materials, DCL Colliders, dimensions, land size constraints and components that are not supported in DCL.

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?

## Abstract

As decentraland grows ever so quickly, a lot of content created is not seen or aware to users. Is it possible to create NFTs like fireworks that could be utilised at their content to attract more users to that spot? For example, new services can have firework animations coming from there.  Or to make it more amazing, real life footage of fireworks created as an NFT. With a new service you would also expect a crowd around the content. Would it be possible to create, for example, NFTs of crowds? So currently we have nightclubs with DJs doing their most to promote their presence and venue. Would it be possible to have different sized NFTs according to crowd size which can be put at the content to create more awareness, like an advertising ploy


## Grant size

1,500 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x23Cf8AB359e16929944F1Aa8De0D3c5dCD3A520e

## Description

Content creators require marketing and advertising techniques to allow users an opportunity of letting them know of their presence. Inserting content in Decentraland and establishing their creations is one thing, but driving a market to it and creating sales is something not touched on. Fireworks for new content that shoots high in the air or crowds gathering around new content as you visibly approach it are a couple of ideas that I believe would work well in driving users to the new and exciting content available in Decentraland. What do you think?


## Specification

Using the entertainment industry as an example from real world to Decentraland, Decentraland is missing the crowds at nightclubs in this instance. Videographers with prior crowd footage in the real world could create NFTs and sell this as crowd advertising, potentially being of interest to content creators wanting to get a bit of attention to what they have created. This type of footage is also harder to obtain and create these days due to covid and makes old footage and real footage some what new and valuable again.


## Personnel

I mention this because it is something I have readily available from one of the best DJs in South-East Asia and is something he would like to contribute to the crypto space, including his entrance in. I also have some fireworks lying around which I think could like nice in the virtual world. BAKOOM!!!


## Roadmap and milestones

Milestones and achievements could be documented as my team and I are already in progress with this concept. Creating different sized crowds or being able to select the size to go accordingly with the size of content created is one of the last issues before it could be rolled out.

## Description

The funds will be used in the following improvements:

1.  To perform the shopping experience using the avatars already playing in Decentraland
2.  To swift the payment term to Mana crypto instead of debit and credit cards
3.  To integrate the current experience into  Decentraland environment
4.  Corporative marketing  to add the main banks and brands in the Meta Mall of Decentraland
5.  To create wow stores for the big brands with the Decentraland CG community

A high-level skilled team is working together since May 2019 and it is integrated by 10 professionals including  3D artists,  3D UI professionals, Unreal programmers, Front-End, and backend developers. This team will lead all CG community members to develop stores and assets performed according to the needs of Meta Mall technologies.

All the stores for the companies will be a giant win opportunity for the CG community and the Metaverse users in general.  MANA will be used not only in shopping transactions but also to reward the CG contributions ( 3D stores and 3D assets). That´s why we are sure that Meta Mall will contribute to MANA´s growth in the next years.


## Specification

Please visit www.go2virtual.shop to feel our technology. We combine different technologies like Unreal Engine, real-time streaming focused on 3D interactions developed by our team, node.js, react, C++, and AWS cloud infrastructure.

Our project is a continued development tool so will be listing more brands and stores every month. We expect to add 200 well-known brands to the Meta Mall in the next 18 months.

## Description

This proposal encompasses a plan to prepare simple guides to build everyday items within Decentraland. It will also act as a progressively elaborated index for interesting addresses, collections, POIs, scenes, characters/names and games in DC. Roadmap is detailed in schedule below.


## Specification

Website with appropriate domain, content with index and guide.


## Personnel

I intend to run this alone to more efficiently manage grant resources. I have already acquired the domain and am currently gathering the necessary content to the create a layperson’s guide to assist with building in DC.  The intent is not to recreate the wheel, but build-on and index already available information (with a simplified guide to pull it all together!). This will hopefully make it easier for further entrants to understand and pull information together quicker. My background is in project management and software product management, I believe this uniquely positions me to see the bigger picture and capture this sufficiently.

I must say that I want to see Mario Party, Mario Kart and Goldeneye type games and communities in DCL asap.  No need for licensing. We all know what they look like and now one holds IP over those style of games. So please do not think I mean these actual games. I am merely using them as examples.  Each land or parcel could host different boards, levels and tracks. We could build stadiums where we congregate to watch. DCL members could form leagues, for example Tuesday night Goldeneye league where teams of 4 have already paid their league fee, say 100 mana for 8 weeks where the teams compete for prizes (NFTS, crypto) . Audience members can wager on the outcomes. Additionally individual users can wager crypto against each other whenever leagues aren't active. High scores can be dominantly displayed for bragging rights but also as a challenge to others. I also believe that this  will lead to a NFT explosion as they would give you an actual perk/powerup in the game. for example say a skull shifter on your kart in the race that give you a banana every lap. this makes a very prominent USE case for NFTS beyond looking cool. I want to see a DAO proposal that funds paying developers and artists to build exactly this. Do you?

In the beginning of my Decentraland experience it did not bother me to go into my inventory and make an outfit quick.. Now, i am two months in Decentraland and i have to scroll and sometimes my items dont load or they are still loading.. Can we please have a saved outfits section where we can have save up to 10 outfits and load them up.. There are times when i am making my outfit and in the middle of making it, it resets back to normal which can be frustrating for some.. I am not sure if this happens for everyone though, I am only speaking from my experience and would love to see this as an addition in Decentraland.

When a person new to DCL starts their experience, one of the first things they do is design their avatar. While there is currently a variety of natural skin tones and hair styles, the eyes, nose and mouth options are limited to lided, narrow and thin options.

Representation matters. For someone to begin imagining a new world they first need to see themselves in it. ""You could see black people on television, but you never saw black people in the future until Gene Roddenberry put a beautiful black woman on that show. And not just a beautiful black woman, but a beautiful black woman who was the communications officer. She wasn't cleaning house,"" Goldberg said. That's why Goldberg wanted to be part of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" ~ from CNet Article

There is a free market solution to this. Unless the creators of inclusive physical traits release a Common amount for 0 MANA, it is not equitable. Rather than relying on individuals to create more diverse, facial feature options, should it be an expanded part of the default tool kit every user has access to?

Should the following Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

Our aim is to offer the full range collection of ALIVE AND MORE(http://instagram.com/aliveandmore ) as wearable Decentraland NFTS. This would be presented as a fashion show with an after party inside Decentraland with some of europe, usa, hong kong and uks premier DJs.


## Grant size

3,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0x2fdc5ec86B1744F8884D08FE404AC2F8612d3528

## Description

Our project is looking for funding as an independent real world art brand to be among the first to offer all of our real world pieces as Decentraland wearables. Making it possible to engage with our art in the metaverse and in the real world. We feel this will be a blueprint for the streetwear community bridging their creations to Decentraland. We know that as a  independent designer with conviction we want to spread our vision across every known universe even the parallel. In addition to the wearables and art we will bring the music that is a major cultural part of the brand dna. Having already worked on real world events with artists like Seth Troxler, Martinez Brothers, A$AP Rocky, and some of the best DJs from Berlin to London to Hong Kong and Brazil we see an after party as the best way to bring the vision into the full audio visual experience by recruiting a nice lineup of artists to share a great event with the Decentraland community to celebrate with ALIVE AND MORE


## Specification

The wearables will be by the designer and artist behind ALIVE AND MORE Karl Phenom ( http://instagram.com/karlphenom
Having the first hand experience in the construction and design of the original real world pieces will make executing the Decentraland wearables with as much authenticity possible a key in the results of the works.

For the After party event we plan to stream live video of Djs performing from around the world at their respective studios using OBS Studio and RTMP-Server.com as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBDf-dR7DU

While the aim will be to live stream the dj sets we may or may not accept pre-recorded video of the performances and then stream them live at the event for the first time to the community


## Personnel

Karl ""Phenom"" Jouanni based in Ibiza, Spain aka the Illustrious one the Art Creative Director, Designer and Founder of ALIVE AND MORE and TEAM RELMS ( https://screenshot-media.com/the-future/fashion/alive-and-more/ )  will head the majority of the wearable designs using Photoshop, Blender, Unity and Maya. This will involve converting the artwork from the real world ALIVE AND MORE pieces to the  Decentraland wearables.  We will recreate each piece to give the community a chance to make their avatars as ""fly"" as possible in ALIVE. You can see here on http://instagram.com/aliveandmore and http://instagram.com/teamrelms the many examples of avatars created with Alive pieces as their skins/clothing.

Mehdi Sultani Producer bases in Melbourne Australia will head the logistics and planning for the event. Working alongside the Djs and artists the primary task will be curating the list of djs/artists then setting up/ securing each studio spaces for the performances to live stream record from. Organising scheduling stream times and running this through to the decentraland event space. Our site for this will be here https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-86%2C-93\&realm=fenrir-amber


## Roadmap and milestones

Our estimated time line will be to launch the first collection event on September 11th 2021 to coincide with the beginning of FASHION WEEK Spring Summer 22 in NYC . This would give us 1 Month to develop and design the full collection. 1 Month to design and develop our Decentraland showroom experience to unveil the wearables and offer them on the marketplace.  We offer the community to buy/sell/ collect and with some proposed gamified elements we will introduce the opportunity to win the ALIVE wearables.  Following the launch we will then throw the after party event 3 weeks later as a completion to the first Alive Decentraland Fashion week season offering. We will invite the community to enjoy the live music and show off their wearables and how they chose to combine them with their looks and avatars if they did get a chance to grab one. As well this will be another opportunity to buy/sell/ trade Alive wearables. With a successful launch we can be an example the inspires all creatives to bring their real world designs to Decentraland wearables.

16208,16208,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Automatically add an option to Community Polls to signal invalid questions/answers,"> by 0xffac7fd045303112fdb28e9dace8e1334ad324c0 (eordano)

Context: There are some polls that don't have feasible options to vote. One such example is [we in 2021](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7f4a1f60-c838-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2) or [How many people...?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f4ac0d20-bf2a-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301).

The poll [Should we be actively seeking developers for game design?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9adc5520-e018-11eb-a20f-d75df7f87ed8) came up in a conversation as an example of a poll with more than two ""no"" options. It might be interesting to have the Snapshot frontend automatically generate an option that signals to the creator of the poll that the question was framed incorrectly.

It might bring us some vote dilution, though. I propose that the votes towards the ""Invalid"" option don't count towards the threshold of 66% to accept a vote (for example, if 1M mana votes no, 3M mana vote yes, 2M mana vote invalid, that would count as 75% acceptance -- only the 1M of the ""no"" option and the 3M corresponding to the ""yes"" option would count).

- Yes, automatically add an 'Invalid question/options' option to all polls
- No, don't automatically add options 
- Maybe: this idea needs more work
- Invalid question/options

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

On-board and educate creators, brands and celebrities in fashion, or any other industry indicating an interest in the Metaverse and all it has to offer. Let’s show them Decentraland and help them understand what makes it a very special place and help them create vibrant and supportive communities within the DCL landscape!  No one wants a cash grab, and I can provide a guided program of enlightenment into DCL!

## Description

INTRO: We are currently experiencing a flood of creators, brands and celebrities express interest in NFT's and all things Metaverse,  including fashion creators but also big brands and other industries.  We know many want to enter the space- I am here to ensure they are expertly guided keeping DCL community values in mind at all times with the goal of providing an amazing value-added experience for their fans and supporters as well as our beloved community.  Many do not know the first clue of how to begin and I receive messages regularly on all platforms that ask the question, can you help me??   I would like to solve this problem by providing an on-boarding experience that is easy to understand, exciting as well as tailored for them and enlightening in terms of what the community of DCL will respond to and embrace.  Let’s create a space to showcase talent, encourage collaboration with the DCL community and feature any artist who is interested in putting their work in front of these high - profile entities, whether it be a celebrity, brand or influencer.

DEEPER DIVE: High-profile creators, celebrities and brands are coming, it’s just a matter of time.  I am committed to easing the friction and helping on-board high profile creators in fashion, or other industries, brands, boutiques, celebrities, you name it, while always keeping in the forefront the values and sense of community that is Decentraland.   I also want to encourage the creation of wearables for women in DCL!  And I want to encourage kids and students who are fascinated by art/fashion and design, or even architecture to have a space to communicate and collaborate with designers and artists, and to find mentors in the space.  This will generally start with a tour of the main POI in DCL, but it won’t be just a  ‘tour'.  It will be a tailored experience based upon their industry and goals; Gathering a network of our best DCL artist creators is an important step in supporting the DCL ecosystem.  Essentially, a pool of professionals who are available and who want to connect with brands and creators.  During the introductory tour, I will ensure celebrities and brands are visiting the places in DCL that will enlighten and show them what is possible, give them a sense of excitement and a sense of understanding of the myriad of possibilities and incredible value to both themselves, their dedicated fans and the DCL community.   Community is my big emphasis and I just know the excitement generated will lead to projects and benefit the ecosystem of DCL.
I fully recognize that the NFT / Decentraland community cares deeply about creating value for the community and so do I!  Let me help onboard those that are quasi-guaranteed to step into the space with or without us, ensuring a spectacular and value-added experience for all involved!  To this end, I’d love to find a landing space in DCL to start our tours, and eventually hold mini-workshops, fashion shows, art shows, movie showings and conferences bringing creative minds together, AND to create a boutique-like experience to support and encourage collaboration between brand and our artist/creator DCL community.


## Specification

Hire project coordinator(s)  - Responsibilities will include Discord moderation and communication with clients.
Hire Website Designer, Videographer
Educate introductory tour guides
Any left over monies will be used for the Buildout of a space in DCL if we cannot find one, OR programs that will go towards education!

And my website about page:  https://www.nftcreatortours.com/about
I’ve conducted docent tours around the Metaverse during DCL 100xArt Week, have volunteered with NFTs.tip s both on the Admin side and as a Clubhouse Room moderator, a writing contributor to NFTS.WTF, helped with several drops and am currently helping about 8 high profile NFT projects as we speak. I have toured high profile clients (musicians, BBoys, NYPL, movie production designers) throughout DCL.  I have helped organize high profile speaker panels combining a clubhouse room, twitter space, screen share on Discord or zoom depending on clients location showing walk-though in DCL as well.   Beginner education including how to set up a Metamask and safety/security.  My favorite thing to do in my free time right now is to attend any DCL event where @category5music is playing!
I have an intimate understanding of the wants and needs of fashion creators after having worked in the modeling industry in Paris on the business/accounting side.  And after a stint working on a team in support of the luxury group Kering and later co-creating a luxury medical practice, I understand deeply what is required to succeed in these high-end industries, AND the mindset of businesses in Europe. Plus let’s face it- DCL is a tour de force of a Metaverse!  I look forward to creating relationships with those I haven’t met already in DCL!


## Roadmap and milestones

In Phase I,  provide introductory tours and fully onboard 3-4 either creators/brands/celebrities.  Onboarding includes a drop and drop party in DCL.  That is our goal between now and March 2022.

In Phase 2: Outreach to schools in the creative arts (think Parsons School of Design) and help with introducing them to the space, providing an eventual Student Mentorship program (Phase 2 by end of May 2022)

Phase 3:  If I can find a space to host us,  or if we end up being able to buy a space in DCL to create this:  A “gift shop” type of experience after our very first tour!  Featuring wearables and art we found along our tour.  (Think: high quality Museum gift shop like theMOMA).

\*\* LATE PHASE POSSIBILITY: Conferences and/or Events planned for the benefit of our artist/technical community and a DCL Kid Creator Fashion Show of all the wearables that came into the space during this time plus our Kid Collabs!!  Get ready ladies and gentlemen, we want to show you what collaboration between kids/students and established creators can come up with !!    (Planned for Q1 of 2023)

I’m so excited about the initiative and I truly hope we can receive funding to make this a reality.  I know I can provide value for all involved and for the beloved DCL community!

16217,16217,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,The Circulating Rebate/Referral Voucher and Perpetual Gratuity Week,"> by 0xefd13f676744a527b1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8 (Remy)

Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

The components of this idea is that it will boost commerce on Decentraland, raise brand awareness of the creators and their stores, and bring more attention to the platform for it's ingenuity and creative events. This will be an NFT rebate and referral voucher meant to incentivize players to purchase wearables from participating vendors as well as to share the rebate via referring a friend's wallet address, whereby the voucher then shows up in there wallet available to use on their first purchase. The voucher will become void if it is not used in a specified time frame. I will describe the model in more detail in the description field.


## Grant size

5,000 USD

## Beneficiary address

0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8

## Description

The Circulating Rebate/Referral voucher is an NFT voucher designed to allow the player to receive a 10% discount on their next NFT purchase after making an initial purchase at participating vendor's stores. After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the ""Perpetual Gratuity Week"" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.
The best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.


## Specification

This is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well. I will use the grant to employ a programmer to write the code for this NFT and I will then issue it to the Decentraland DAO for them to mint the necessary amount of vouchers to equal the number of items each participating vendor is selling in this event.


## Personnel

I work with only one designer and coder for these types of projects. We have done collaborations in the past and I am confident we will deliver on this proposal in a timely manner with ease. I am currently working with a freelancer named Anmol M. from freelancer . com. He and I have a great working relationship and he has really came through for me in the past.


## Roadmap and milestones

I will only need two to three weeks to get this project done. The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement. I recognize that any goals worth achieving require the aid of the talented and the willing, and I invite those types to my circle to strive for achievement and to celebrate any success that follows. I am a bit of a visionary with enthusiasm to create and to build others up while doing so. I also believe in responsible capitalism and investing in others and their aims, should they be worthy of it. This is me, and this is my proposal, and I want to extend a big thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.

The Builder (https://builder.decentraland.org/) is currently running 6.6.3 (or lower I am not exactly sure) while the latest SDK is 6.6.5.  This is not a major issue however the further behind the builder gets the more issues may appear between what you see in Builder and what you see when deployed.

For example introduced in 6.6.4 there was a backwards breaking change.  ""There used to be a gimbal lock problem where going from Quaternion > Euler wasn't a symmetric conversion, so if you converted quaternion to euler and back you might not have the same angle"".  This was a fix that was needed however anything running the SDK before this fix may need to be adjusted to work correctly again.  There happened to be a few smart items using this function.   In the builder it looked OK because it did not have the latest SDK.  However when deployed it the rotation was not right.

Patching the builder to the newer SDK will help keep the gap of issues like this to a minimum

- Builder should be patched to latest SDK
- Builder can remain on old SDK for now

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?

## Abstract

Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes and Competencies are attributes of people and they should be owned, managed, controlled by the people who grow and develop these attributes. SkillProfile is currently a mobile app that lets people gather feedback from friends and colleagues and puts it together in a SkillProfile that can be shared (or not) by the individual requesting. Like a 360 review but for everyone and controlled by the individual, not the employer.
We are submitting this grant to build out an experience to help people in the metaverse build their SkillProfile(s) and use it to gain employment (or just have fun) in Decentraland. We are 3 founders (2 in Silicon valley, 1 on US East coast) with deep experience in tech. www.skillprofile.com

0xEcAF4d16c3579F92eF441AC6aE35249FcEcAaBf1

## Description

The metaverse world is just beginning and we believe it will change the way people interact. Skillprofile is the brainchild of Kris Lundin, a woman with deep experience in tech as a product leader for startups and large companies. She is joined by Owen Davis a technologist with deep experience building world class software with over 20 years experience and a passion for new technology. Our COO is Noah Jacobson who is a trained lawyer and operational leader. We've built our mobile app and just launched it this year in the Play and App stores and are gaining traction.\
SkillProfile lets people create profiles made up of Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and then request anonymous feedback from their friends and colleagues and see the aggregate rating and comments.
It's like a 360 review but controlled by the individual and not limited to traditional employment or executives. It democratizes HR and Talent practices and puts it in the hands and control of the people themselves. It can also be extended to non-traditional employment and even game profiles (are you a good teammate, do you tilt under pressure, etc).

We would like to bring Skillprofile to the metaverse by creating a skills-based game and allows people to own their own profiles and then develop a place where people can share those profiles with others and expand the way we communicate and find employment or other like minded individuals in the metaverse.

Our second phase would include the build out of a job board where users can share their SkillProfiles and potential employers or teammates can identify individuals who might be good candidates to either participate in their games, act as hosts, or do other necessary tasks to maintain the metaverse. Of course as Decentraland develops the way in which people interact could evolve in new and exciting ways so I hesitate to call it traditional employment but more like a place people can learn about themselves, develop their attributes and use them to create a life and experience they want.
I believe we can create a place where what you bring to the table is verified, owned and is uniquely the individual and where others can find those people.


## Specification

SkillProfile the app is already live in the Google Play store and the Apple App store and can be downloaded. It is fully functional, built on React Native uses a Google Cloud Platform back end based on Firebase. We would be extending the SkillProfile to be stored on the Ethereum blockchain and to be able to be shared with others in Decentraland. We will also be creating an interactive experience or game to engage new users to claim theirs and start gathering feedback from people they interact with both in game and out.
With the grant we would purchase some land in Decentraland to create our scene and will be using Unity to develop an in world game/destination where participants can play, learn about skills. We have not fully fleshed out the game mechanics yet but we know it will relate to Knowlege Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and will help users flesh out their own personal Skillprofiles. Below is a walkthrough of the app we created already and is the foundation for our idea.

Kristin Lundin, CEO SkillProfile - She is a product leader with about 20 years of experience in HR and  Martech industries. She has built world class software her entire career at companies like Kronos, Fidelity Investments and Salary.com and most recently serves as the VP of Platform Solutions at TapClicks (a leading martech company in silicon valley)
Owen Davis, CTO SkillProfile - He is a technology leader with over 20 years of experience in Financial Services, Martech and others. He is a full architect with several full enterprise class projects. He also has experience leading development teams to deliver great projects. He is currently the Senior Director of Software Engineering at TapClicks as well.
We have several contractor relationships for UI/UX  and other development support both onshore US and offshore for React and Unity.
Noah Jacobson - COO SkillProfile - He is a business leader who has helped create several startups and he helps us to navigate the business landscape and negotiate contracts and helps with finance, legal and funding discussions.


## Roadmap and milestones

If we are funded - we will begin the process of purchasing the required land and development of the specifications needed to build out the experience.
Milestones would be:

a) Land is purchased for SkillProfile (due 2 weeks after funding)
b) Game Design brief  (due 2 weeks after funding)
c) Ethereum Blockchain integration with existing Skillprofile infrastructure (due at 1 month cliff) - Share individual's SP to Blockchain wallet and necessary APIs for management of transactions
d) Scene completion with game/interaction wireframe/prototype due at 1 month cliff. User testing and iteration will begin
e) Game/interaction full launch at 3 months
f) Skill Sharing and Search launched at 6 months with users able to find others (if people make their profiles public) to connect and share.

For instance: if a person wants to play a multiplayer game that needs teamwork they could create a listing for someone with the required skills and find people who have chosen to share their profile.  Same - if someone needs a volunteer coordinator for a new casino in Decentraland they could find someone who has the knowledge of running a casino along with the needed organizational skills and customer service attitudes.
If a person needed a creative designer to skin a new NFT for their next in-world concert launch  they could post/find a designer to work with them on the project, all from within Decentraland.
